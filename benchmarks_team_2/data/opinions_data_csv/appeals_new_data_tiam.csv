1622,ann skiffington  vs.  liberty mutual insurance company.,"motor vehicle, insurance. insurance, motor vehicle insurance, construction of policy, coverage, settlement of claim, amount of recovery for loss.in a civil action arising from a motor vehicle accident, in which the plaintiff as a third-party claimant sought payment from the defendant motor vehicle insurer for costs arising from the plaintiff's loss of use of her vehicle following the accident, the judge properly dismissed the complaint where, although the applicable insurance policy required the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for actual costs incurred from loss of use, the plaintiff failed to plead or otherwise demonstrate incurring such actual costs. [3-5]in a civil action arising from a motor vehicle accident, this court declined to consider a claim that the defendant insurer was liable for the title and registration fees for the plaintiff's motor vehicle and the residual value of the vehicle's inspection sticker, where the plaintiff failed to make an adequate argument that the language of the applicable insurance policy would entitle her to reimbursement of those fees. [5]","following a motor vehicle accident, the plaintiff, a third-party claimant, received reimbursement from liberty mutual insurance company (liberty mutual) for the loss of her vehicle.  she then sought additional payment for (1) costs arising from loss of use of her vehicle, even though she was unable to produce any documentation to liberty mutual that she had paid for substitute transportation, and (2) her title and registration fees and the residual value of her inspection sticker.  when liberty mutual denied liability for these claims, the plaintiff brought this putative class action, seeking declaratory relief under g. l. c. 231a and damages for unfair claim settlement practices under g. l. c. 93a, § 9, and g. l. c. 176d, § 3(9).  on liberty mutual's motion, a superior court judge dismissed the complaint in its entirety under mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6),  365 mass. 754  (1974), and the plaintiff appeals.  as we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to allege compensable damages, we affirm, modifying the judgment to declare the rights of the parties.background.  we accept the allegations of the amended complaint as true for purposes of this appeal.  see goodwin v. lee pub. schs.,, 284 (2016).  in october of 2015, the plaintiff's 2005 nissan altima was struck by a driver whose vehicle was insured by liberty mutual under a standard massachusetts automobile policy.the plaintiff's vehicle was declared to be a total loss.  after determining that its insured was responsible for the accident, liberty mutual reimbursed the plaintiff for the loss of her vehicle.the plaintiff then sent liberty mutual a demand letter under g. l. c. 93a, claiming that she was also entitled to payment for loss of use, title and registration fees, and the residual value of her inspection sticker.  liberty mutual sent a letter in response detailing its rationale for denying the claims.  liberty mutual also requested, on at least two occasions, that the plaintiff provide ""documentary or other proof indicating that she actuallypage 3incurred"" costs relating to loss of use -- such as receipts showing she rented a replacement vehicle or took public transportation.  it is uncontested that the plaintiff never provided any such substantiation.discussion.  we review de novo the judge's allowance of liberty mutual's motion to dismiss under mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6).  see goodwin, 475 mass. at 284.  in conducting our review, we ""accept[] as true the facts alleged in the plaintiff['s] complaint and exhibits attached thereto, and favorable inferences that reasonably can be drawn from them.""  ibid., quoting from burbank apartments tenant assn. v. kargman,, 116 (2016).1.  loss of use.  despite failing to plead actual costs related to loss of use of her vehicle, the plaintiff contends that she is still entitled to some unspecified amount of damages because the standard policy provides coverage whether or not she actually incurred costs for substitute transportation.  we disagree.  to determine what damages are compensable under the standard policy, we must interpret the policy's words ""in light of their plain meaning, giving full effect to the document as a whole.""  given v. commerce ins. co.,, 209 (2003) (citation omitted).  we consider ""what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.""  ibid., quoting from hazen paper co. v. united states fid. & guar. co.,, 700 (1990).  furthermore, because the policy language is prescribed by the commissioner of insurance, we do not construe any ambiguities in it against the insurer.  golchin v. liberty mut. ins. co.,, 225 (2011), s.c.,(2013).with respect to third-party claimants, coverage is governed by part 4 of the policy, which provides that the insurer ""will pay . . . the amounts that [the third party] is legally entitled to collect for property damage through a court judgment or settlement,"" including ""the loss of use of the damaged property"" (emphasis supplied).  we construe the word ""costs"" according to its ""usual and accepted meaning.""  mount vernon fire ins. co. v. visionaid, inc.,, 348 (2017), quoting from federal natl. mort. assn. v. rego,, 334 (2016).  in ordinary usage ""cost"" refers to ""the amount or equivalent paid or charged for something,"" merriam-webster's collegiate dictionary 282 (11th ed. 2007); it means, in other words, an expense that is actually incurred.  ""as the plain meaning of the word . . . is clear, we do not deviate from it.""  mount vernon fire ins. co., supra at 348.page 4attempting to sidestep this plain language, the plaintiff asserts that the standard policy conflicts with g. l. c. 90, § 34o, as appearing in st. 1976, c. 266, § 7, which requires ""[e]very policy of property damage liability insurance [to] provide that the insurer will pay on behalf of the insured all sums the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property,"" (emphasis supplied).  the plaintiff's assertion of a conflict is based on the fact that the statute does not refer explicitly to ""costs.""  but that omission does not create any conflict with the policy because the statute also does not define what constitutes ""loss of use thereof.""  it was therefore within the authority of the commissioner of insurance to fill in that gap when ""decid[ing] what the terms of a standard policy will be.""  colby v. metropolitan property & cas. ins. co.,, 806 (1995).  see given, 440 mass. at 213-214.the tort decisions cited by the plaintiff do not aid her cause.  none of those decisions directly addressed the question whether a plaintiff can recover loss of use damages absent proof of any actual out-of-pocket expenses.  and as a more general matter, the plaintiff does not explain why common-law tort principles should trump the plain language of the standard policy.  see id. at 210-211 (""[t]he issue before us is not whether, in some other context, diminution in market value would be an appropriate method by which to calculate monetary damages for some form of injury to property,"" but whether ""that is the form or measure of 'damage' that the standard policy is intended to cover"").even assuming, moreover, that tort law informs our analysis, the plaintiff fares no better in light of our recent decision in ramirez v. commerce ins. co.,(2017).  at issue there was the provision in part 4 of the standard policy requiring reimbursement of ""applicable sales tax.""  we held that the plaintiff was not automatically entitled to such reimbursement but, rather, had to ""provide to the insurer proof of the payment of sales tax on a replacement automobile.""  id. at 148.  citing tort cases, we reasoned that the insurer ""is only responsible for placing the plaintiff in the same position as he was before suffering the loss.""  id. at 147-148.  thus, the plaintiff had to ""establish[] that [sales tax] is an element of the damages he incurred or will incur"" before he could recover ""applicable sales tax"" from the insurer.  id. at 148.we similarly conclude that the plaintiff had to substantiate to the insurer that she incurred actual damages -- i.e., actual costspage 5for substitute transportation -- to recover for loss of use under part 4 of the standard policy.  as the plaintiff does not dispute that she did not incur actual costs, she is not entitled to loss of use damages.2.  title, registration, and inspection fees.  we decline to consider the plaintiff's claim that liberty mutual is liable for her title and registration fees and the residual value of her inspection sticker.  the plaintiff does not point to any provision in the standard policy that would entitle her to reimbursement of those fees.  instead, she relies exclusively on tort law.  but again, the scope of liberty mutual's obligation to pay is governed by the policy.  see given, 440 mass. at 210-211.  the plaintiff does not contend that title, registration, and inspection fees constitute ""property damage"" under part 4 of the policy or that they are covered by some other provision of the policy.  as she has thus failed to make an adequate argument based on the language of the policy, we do not consider her claim.conclusion.  although there was no error in the judge's allowance of liberty mutual's motion to dismiss the complaint, the judge was required to make a declaration of the rights of the parties.  see boston v. massachusetts bay transp. authy.,, 829 (1977).  the judgment below shall therefore be modified to declare that liberty mutual is not obligated to pay the plaintiff damages for loss of use, title or registration fees, or the residual value of her inspection sticker.  as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.so ordered.",civil,Constance M.

[10-12] rubin, j., dissenting.a superior court judge did not err in denying a criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence found in a motor vehicle, where the search of the motor vehicle was reasonable and the discovery of the incriminating objects was, at any rate, inevitable. [12]at a criminal trial, the admission in evidence of a substitute chemist's testimony regarding the makeup of a substance seized by police from a motor vehicle did not deprive the defendant of his right to confront witnesses against him, where the substitute chemist testified as to his own independent opinion, and where defense counsel cross-examined the substitute chemist regarding the basis of his opinion, the testing procedures used, and their susceptibility to error. [12-13]","after a jury trial in superior court, the defendant, radhames gonzalez, was convicted of possession of cocaine withpage 7intent to distribute, carrying a firearm without a license, possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, possession of a large capacity feeding device, and possession of a large capacity weapon during the commission of a felony.the defendant argues that (1) his motion to suppress should have been allowed because the information supplied by a confidential informant (ci) did not justify the investigatory stop of his motor vehicle; and (2) the admission in evidence of a substitute chemist's testimony deprived the defendant of his right to ""confront"" the witness.  we affirm.background.  we set forth the facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented where necessary with uncontroverted evidence drawn from the record of the suppression hearing.  see commonwealth v. watson,, 726 n.5 (2000).sergeant william west of the billerica police department testified that he had been a patrol sergeant for two years, and that he had formerly been a detective in the criminal bureau for sixteen years.  as a detective, he had investigated all types of crimes including narcotics offenses and had worked with informants ""no less than a hundred times.""  in june, 2013, about one year after he had become a sergeant, west was contacted by a ci with whom west had worked on more than one occasion when he was a detective.on this occasion, the ci provided a description of a man who went by the name of ""eddie,"" later identified as the defendant, who was dealing heroin and cocaine in and around the gaelic club (club) in lowell.  the ci described the defendant as a dominican male who drove a white buick rendezvous cxl sport utility vehicle bearing license plate 676 nb4.  the ci indicated that on friday nights the defendant used the club as a base of operation and that the ci personally observed the defendant make cocaine sales in the club's bathroom.  the ci also indicated that the defendant would receive telephone calls and travel to individuals' homes to sell drugs.  the ci also told west that the defendant usually carried a firearm and the ci believed the defendant did not have a valid driver's license.because west was no longer involved in narcotics investigations and because the club was in lowell, not billerica, he passed the ci's tip and contact number to sergeant noone of the lowellpage 8police department.  west explained to noone that the ci was an informant who had been ""signed up by billerica"" and had been reliable in the past, including having given information that led to arrests and seizures.  noone assigned the matter to lowell police detective rafael rivera.  when rivera spoke by phone with the ci, the ci repeated what he had disclosed to west and that he had seen the defendant in the club only a ""couple of days before,"" in possession of drugs and his gun.  rivera ran the license plate number the ci had given him and the records showed that the vehicle was registered to kennedy ruiz-mejia.on friday, june 28, 2013, at about 7:25 p.m., rivera and three other undercover officers, in four separate vehicles, set up surveillance around the club.  rivera saw a vehicle matching the make, model, license plate, and color supplied by the ci.  after a few minutes, a man matching the description of ""eddie"" exited the club, got into the vehicle, and drove away.  when the vehicle turned into a gasoline station, lowell police detective michael kandrotas pulled in behind it, activating the concealed lights and siren on his unmarked cruiser.kandrotas exited his vehicle and, as he approached, observed the driver make a quick movement to his right, as if to toss something into the back seat.  because the defendant had been reported to carry a firearm, kandrotas had the defendant exit the vehicle.  rivera joined kandrotas and recognized the defendant as someone he knew from prior narcotics investigations.rivera confirmed through dispatch that the defendant did not have a current driver's license.  the defendant was placed under arrest for operating a vehicle without a license.  rivera searched the defendant and found $5,100 on his person.  the defendant was transported to the police station.  during booking, it was determined that the defendant had an alias of eddie mambru.because the defendant's vehicle was blocking a gasoline pump, and the police were going to search it, the police moved it across the street to a school parking lot after the defendant was arrested.  the lowell inventory policy, which was introduced at the motion hearing, provides for the inventory and towing of a vehicle that was, or is, being used in the commission of a crime.  when police opened the rear door, they observed a loaded .40 caliber semiautomatic handgun poorly concealed in a sock on the floor.  in apage 9second sock, police recovered twenty-seven bags, each containing a powder later confirmed to be cocaine.the motion judge found that the police had conducted an investigatory stop based on information supplied by the ci.  the judge recognized that in such circumstances, the ci's information must establish both the reliability and basis of knowledge prongs set forth under the aguilar-spinelli test.the judge reasoned that ""'[b]ecause the standard is reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause, a less rigorous showing in each of these areas is permissible' . . . [and] independent police corroboration may 'make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors.'""  commonwealth v. pinto,, 364 (2017), quoting from commonwealth v. depina,, 243 (2010).applying this standard, the judge ruled that the ci's basis of knowledge was self-evident from the tip and founded on personal observation.  on the veracity prong, according to west, ""the information [the ci] provided allowed [west] to seize various types of narcotics, make drug seizures and drug arrests, as well as seizing money, the proceeds of drug profits.""  through cross-examination, defense counsel elicited that individuals who make controlled buys are considered to be ""informant[s]""; that ""if [a] person had, in fact, made a series of purchases on behalf of the billerica [p]olice [d]epartment, [west] could honestly say that that individual had provided [west] with information that if it did lead to arrest, to arrest and seizure . . . ""; and that, specifically, this ci had previously made controlled buys for the billerica police department.  the commonwealth did not ask west on redirect examination whether the ci previously had been a tipster and not merely a controlled buyer.  the judge specifically found:  ""i understand [west's] testimony to mean that the ci supplied substantive information as well as helping with controlled buys.""  the judge also found that knowledge of the ci's past track record of reliability with billerica, which was conveyed to lowell, was sufficient to ""satisf[y] the veracity test.""page 10discussion.  1.  motion to suppress.  a.  the stop.  ""in reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, but conduct an independent review of the judge's ultimate findings and conclusions of law.""  commonwealth v. washington,, 480 (2007).here, because there is no live dispute regarding the ci's basis of knowledge, given the ci's personal observations of the defendant in possession of drugs and a gun only days prior to the tip, we focus on the evidence of the ci's veracity.  the motion judge gave west's testimony regarding the ci's prior track record its plain and ordinary meaning, namely that on more than one previous occasion the ci had directly provided material information regarding violations of the law and, further, that the ci provided ""substantive information.""  the judge's finding of fact comports with the language west used, the testimony that the informant had been reliable in the past, and the common situation presented in police work in which a ci provides material information regarding criminal violations and is then engaged to execute a controlled buy.see, e.g., commonwealth v. perez-baez,, 44-46 (1991) (recitation that informant had ""provided information"" previously that led to arrests and seizure of cocaine sufficiently established informant's veracity); commonwealth v. mendes,, 365 (2012) (ci provided information and made controlled buy); commonwealth v. baldasaro,, 926 (2004) (same); commonwealth v. velez,, 273 (2010) (same); commonwealth v. lima,, 119 n.5 (2011) (same); commonwealth v. perez,, 554 (2016) (same).the defendant contends that there was a possible alternative interpretation of west's testimony:  that in the past the ci could have been only a controlled buyer who had not providedpage 11information, which would be insufficient to establish the ci's veracity.  see commonwealth v. carrasquiello,, 775-776 (1998) (differentiating between confidential informants as tipsters and controlled buyers for purposes of veracity).this argument is insufficient to show clear error in the motion judge's findings of fact.first, on a motion to suppress, ""[q]uestions of credibility are the province of the motion judge who had the opportunity to observe the witnesses.""  commonwealth v. tremblay,, 205 (2011).  second, and more importantly, that the commonwealth or the motion judge might have asked what seems, possibly only in hindsight, an obvious follow-up question to confirm that the ci previously had been a tipster, rather than merely a controlled buyer, does not allow us to reverse.  where the judge's finding ""is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the [appellate court] may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the [finder] of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.  where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.""  edinburg v. edinburg,, 203 (1986), quoting from anderson v. bessemer city, 470 u.s. 564, 673-574 (1985).  see commonwealth v. carr,, 303 (2010); commonwealth v. gordon,, 327 (2015).moreover, that the defense interpretation of west's testimony may be possible does not make it probable or an inference the motion judge must draw.  a court considers the application for a search warrant, or here whether there was reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop, ""in an ordinary, commonsense manner without hypertechnical analysis.""  perez-baez, 410 mass. at 46, quoting from commonwealth v. melendez,, 60 (1990) (greaney, j., dissenting).  see commonwealth v. blake,, 827 (1992) (search warrant affidavits should be ""read as a whole, not parsed, severed, and subjected to hypercritical analysis"").  ""the standard of reasonable suspicion[, which is lower than the standard of probable cause,] does not require absolute certainty, but only 'sufficient probability,' 'the sort of ""common-sense conclusio[n] about human behavior"" upon which ""practicalpage 12people"" -- including government officials -- are entitled to rely.'""  commonwealth v. buccella,, 486 (2001), quoting from new jersey v. t.l.o., 469 u.s. 325, 346 (1985).b.  the search of the vehicle.  similarly unavailing is the defendant's claim that the search of the vehicle was unreasonable.  after the defendant was arrested, because his vehicle was blocking the pumps at a gasoline station that was open for business, the police moved the vehicle across the street.  regardless of how the police described the ensuing search, the incriminating objects found during the search would have been discovered during the inevitable inventory search conducted before police had the vehicle towed.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. miller,, 389 (1974) (finding search constitutional even though ""the officers did not completely and correctly articulate their grounds,"" where ""from an objective standpoint probable cause existed""); commonwealth v. somers,, 922-923 (1998) (police discovery during automobile stop that defendant had no license warranted order that car be towed); commonwealth v. bienvenu,, 634-635 (2005) (after police stopped car for safety infraction, subsequent tow and inventory search were proper because ""neither defendant could lawfully drive the car"").2.  testimony of substitute chemist.  the defendant argues that testimony of a substitute chemist regarding the makeup of the substance seized from the defendant's vehicle violated his rights under the sixth amendment to the united states constitution and art. 12 of the massachusetts declaration of rights to confront and meet face to face the witnesses against him, and that the commonwealth did not sufficiently prove the unavailability of thepage 13original chemist.testimony by an expert where he or she ""draws upon testing conducted and results reached by other analysts[] who do not testify . . . is permissible provided that the testifying analyst 'reviewed the nontestifying analyst's work, . . . conducted an independent evaluation of the data,' and 'then expressed [his or] her own opinion, and did not merely act as a conduit for the opinions of others.'""  commonwealth v. jones,, 715 (2015), quoting from commonwealth v. greineder,, 595 (2013).  see greineder, supra at 603 (no violation of sixth amendment or art. 12, even where testifying analyst based her opinion on test results of nontestifying analyst that were not admitted in evidence).  unavailability is not a prerequisite to calling a substitute chemist, provided the substitute chemist can be cross-examined on how he or she reached his or her opinion.  see id. at 594-599.the commonwealth introduced the testimony of paul eyerly, a chemist with the state police drug unit in sudbury, who testified as to his own independent opinion of the composition of the substances in question based on tests performed and results obtained by the original chemist.  the defendant cross-examined eyerly regarding the basis on which he formed his opinion, the testing procedures used, and their susceptibility to human error.  we discern no error or any violation of the defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him under the united states constitution or the massachusetts declaration of rights.judgments affirmed.i dissent from the court's holding that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant.  since all evidence discovered was the fruit of an unconstitutional stop, the motion to suppress should have been allowed.in this case, a confidential informant described a dominican male who drove a white buick rendezvous cxl sport utility vehicle of which the confidential informant recited the license plate number.  the confidential informant indicated that on friday nights the man could be found at the gaelic club.  he said that thepage 14man used it as a base of operation, traveling to individuals' homes to sell drugs, and that he personally observed the man make cocaine sales in the club's bathroom.  the confidential informant also told the police that the man usually carried a firearm and that he believed the man did not have a valid driver's license.the police ran the license plate numbers and determined that the car was registered to a kennedy ruiz-mejia.  they did not ascertain whether ruiz-mejia had an active driver's license or a license to carry a firearm.  they then set up surveillance outside the gaelic club on a friday night and saw the car, and when a hispanic-appearing male, the defendant, left the club, got in, and drove away, the police stopped the car.  they had not entered the club.  they had not seen the defendant engage in drug sales or any other suspicious activity.under massachusetts law, we utilize the two-pronged aguilar-spinelli testto determine whether a tip can provide the reasonable suspicion that criminality is afoot necessary to allow an investigative stop.  the veracity prong requires the commonwealth to demonstrate ""that the source of the information was credible or the information reliable.""  commonwealth v. depiero,, 454 (2016).  the central issue in this case, as the court recognizes, is the veracity of the confidential informant.the court also recognizes, and i agree, that, as the motion judge also correctly concluded, the commonwealth could have established the informant's veracity only by showing that the informant had been a tipster in the past, and not merely a controlled buyer.  this is because, while it is well established that an informant's history of providing tips leading to the seizure of narcotics can establish the informant's veracity, see commonwealth v. perez-baez,, 45 (1991), as we have held, one who merely participates in controlled buys is a person of ""unknown reliability.""  commonwealth v. carrasquiello,, 776 (1998).  see id. at 774-777 (distinguishing the veracity of tipsters from that of controlled buyers).  this is because while buying drugs on behalf of the police does provide them with information, it does not entail providing them with any information the police have not generated themselves.  see ibid.  see also commonwealth v. desper,, 168 (1994) (describing the process of controlled buys).page 15and, while corroboration of certain details of a tip can lead to a conclusion that the person who provided it was truthful, confirmation only of the publicly-knowable and not suspicious facts provided by the tipster that a person who drives a certain car goes to a particular club on friday evenings is insufficient to demonstrate the veracity of the tipster's claim that the person also engages in unlawful conduct.  see commonwealth v. lyons,, 20-21 (1990) (""[t]he quantity and quality of the details corroborated by the police were simply insufficient to establish any degree of suspicion that could be deemed reasonable.  the trooper was able to verify only the description of the automobile, the direction in which it was headed, and the race and gender of the occupants before making the stop. . . .  [t]he informant's reliability was only slightly enhanced by this corroboration because the police verified no predictive details that were not easily obtainable by an uninformed bystander. . . .  significantly . . . these defendants displayed no suspicious behavior that might have heightened police concern.  anyone can telephone the police for any reason"").in this case, the only evidence of the informant's past involvement with the police came from sergeant william west's testimony.  on direct examination, he testified that, in the past, the informant had provided ""information"" that led to drug arrests and the seizure of money and narcotics.in cross-examination, though, the defendant's experienced counsel asked sergeant west, ""and if [an individual utilized by the billerica police department to make controlled buys] had, in fact, made a series of purchases on behalf of the billerica [p]olice [d]epartment, you could honestly say that that individual had provided you with information that if it did lead to arrest, to arrest and seizure, is that fair to say?""  the sergeant said, ""yes.""  counsel then asked, ""in the past was [the informant in this case] able to make controlled buys for you when you did use him as an informant for the billerica [p]olice [d]epartment?""  again, the sergeant said, ""yes.""the commonwealth bears the burden of demonstrating the lawfulness of the seizure and thus in this case, in order to demonstrate the veracity of the tip, that the confidential informant had previously acted as a tipster and not merely as a controlled buyer.  defense counsel's careful cross-examination made clear that, according to sergeant west himself, even if one had taken sergeant west's direct testimony to mean that the informant hadpage 16provided tips in the past, that was not necessarily its meaning.  while west's testimony left open the possibility that the confidential informant might have been a tipster as well as a controlled buyer, the officer's direct testimony did not mean that the informant was such a tipster.the commonwealth could have clarified the matter on redirect by asking sergeant west whether the informant had ever provided tips.  it declined to do so.  perhaps this was because it knew that the confidential informant in fact was not a tipster; perhaps it was not.  but in either event, the commonwealth, which, it bears repeating, has the burden here, left a record in which there was insufficient evidence to support the finding, necessary to the motion judge's conclusion that the search was lawful, that the confidential informant had previously been a tipster, not only a controlled buyer.the commonwealth recognized this below, and did not even argue before the judge that the evidence supported a finding that the confidential informant was a tipster.  defense counsel argued:  ""at no time did the sergeant ever say that this informant was a tipster. . . .  i didn't ask him.  my brother didn't ask him. . . .  [a]ll we know about this person, this informant"" is that ""[h]e has performed controlled buys successfully . . . .  we don't know whether he was ever a tipster.  [west] was never asked.""the commonwealth did not disagree, arguing only (and incorrectly) that any information leading to ""an arrest and seizure of contraband substances was by itself sufficient to establish reliability,"" and that, coupled with the details that were corroborated, it was sufficient.the court majority addresses the state of the record with respect to the confidential informant by saying first that we must defer to the motion judge's assessment of sergeant west's credibility.  of course we must.  but the issue is not whether sergeantpage 17west is credible, nor did the judge say it was.the issue is what sergeant west said.  i assume he was perfectly credible.  his testimony, though, cannot support a finding that the confidential informant provided tips in the past.  it is silent on that question.the court majority then suggests that the ""more important[]"" reason we must affirm is that we must defer to the fact finder's choice between ""two permissible views of the evidence.""  ante at 11.  that statement of black letter law is of course true as well, but it is equally irrelevant.to illustrate the point:  if there were testimony that an event happened on a weekend, a judge could not infer solely on that basis that the day on which it happened was a saturday rather than a sunday.  that would not be a case in which one could draw one of two permissible inferences from the evidence in the record (i.e., that it happened on a saturday or that it happened on a sunday).  it would be one in which there was insufficient evidence in the record to support a conclusion on the matter in either direction.  the event might have happened on a saturday.  or it might have happened on a sunday.  but there is no basis upon which a fact finder could, without more, determine which one.  and if it was one party's burden to prove the event happened on a saturday, that party would have failed to meet its burden.that is precisely this case.  whatever one might have thought initially about sergeant west's direct testimony, given his own clarification on cross-examination, it meant only that the confidential informant might have been a tipster (and a controlled buyer as well), or that he might have been only a controlled buyer.  but there was no evidence in the record to support the judge's conclusion that the informant was the former rather than the latter.  choosing between two different possible factual scenarios, either of which might have happened, where there is no evidence in the record about which one actually did occur, is far different than choosing between two permissible views of the evidence in the record, and there would be little left of the rule of law if we eliminated that distinction.page 18because the commonwealth did not provide sufficient evidence to support a positive finding about the veracity of the confidential informant, it failed to demonstrate the reasonable suspicion necessary for the initial stop of the defendant's vehicle.  while i have no quarrel with the rest of the majority's analysis, because all the evidence seized was fruit of that unlawful stop, it should have been suppressed.  with

[31-32]","as a result of information gathered in connection with a homicide, an interstate narcotics investigation began, which led police to discover cocaine and cash at 220-222 howard street in the city of brockton.this is an interlocutory appeal by the commonwealth from the order allowing the defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of a warrantless search.  we reverse in part and affirm in part.we set forth detailed facts and the procedural history of this case as they are necessary to the analysis.  the defendant was indicted for trafficking in two hundred grams or more of cocaine.  he has twice filed motions to suppress.  in his first motion, the defendant argued that the search at 220 howard street was conducted without a warrant and without his consent.  after a two-day evidentiary hearing, the first motion judge denied the motion on grounds that the defendant consented to the search.  in the defendant's second, or so-called ""amended"" motion to suppress, he argued that the evidence seized from 220 howard street must be suppressed as the tainted fruit of the unlawfully obtained cellular site location information (csli).the same judge denied the motion after a nonevidentiary hearing and the defendant sought interlocutory review.page 21a single justice of the supreme judicial court, while retaining jurisdiction of the case, ordered an evidentiary hearing on the motion.  after the evidentiary hearing, a second motion judge denied the motion, concluding that the defendant lacked standing as he had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the cellular telephone.  following receipt of the trial court decision and the issuance of several appellate decisions involving the police use of csli, the single justice again remanded the case to for further consideration in light of commonwealth v. augustine,(2014), and commonwealth v. moody,(2013), as well as riley v. california, 134 s. ct. 2473 (2014).thereafter, a third motion judge held a hearing at which no additional evidence was presented, but the transcripts from the previous hearings were submitted together with additional briefs from the parties.  the third motion judge concluded that the defendant had standing.  he also reasoned that because the police seized the cocaine ""by exploiting the unlawful electronic tracking through csli,"" and because ""[t]he search and seizure was not attenuated from the"" illegal conduct, the motion must be allowed.  the commonwealth's application for leave to appeal from that order  was granted and the case was entered in this court.background.  the findings of fact made by each of the three motion judges are consistent and are not in dispute on appeal.  we summarize the findings relevant to the issues raised in this appeal, supplemented where necessary with undisputed evidence that was implicitly credited by the particular judge ruling on the motion.  see commonwealth v. jones-pannell,, 431 (2015).on june 8, 2008, there was a shooting that resulted in the death of bensney toussaint.  a few days later, on june 10, 2008, police officers obtained an arrest warrant for josener dorisca.  dorisca, for all relevant time periods relating to this matter, was a fugitive from justice.  on june 26, 2008, an indictment was returned against dorisca, charging him with murder.during the homicide investigation, detective kenneth williams of the brockton police department identified cassio vertilas dorisca's best friend.  detective williams spoke to cassio; he was not cooperative, but he gave the detective his cellular telephone number.  detective williams obtained the cellular telephonepage 22records for the number provided by cassio, which showed that ""bill desops"" was the subscriber.  the records also showed that telephone calls were made within moments of the shooting to a cellular telephone number that police identified as belonging to dorisca.  thereafter, detective williams spoke to cassio again, but was unsuccessful in eliciting information about the nature of those telephone calls or dorisca's location.  during the interview, detective williams recognized cassio from a videotape that he had seen.as the second judge found, that videotape, recorded several months before the homicide, captured cassio, ""a person named rinaldi lauradin, and others flashing large sums of money and discussing the movement of drugs from florida to massachusetts.""  a gun could also be seen in the footage.  detective williams testified that ""the tape clearly displays [cassio] and other members engaged in what seems to be very lucrative drug dealings. . . .  and bragging and boasting of going to florida to obtain more drugs.  and they're flashing tens of thousands of dollars on this tape.""about one month after the homicide, detective williams spoke to cassio's brother, kennell.  kennell reported that cassio was now using a different cellular telephone number, and that cassio was on his way to new york with ""paco"" and ""paquito.""  further investigation revealed that paco was the defendant and paquito was stevenson allonce.  after speaking with kennell, the commonwealth sought and obtained an order pursuant to 18 u.s.c. § 2703(d) (2006) requiring the cellular telephone carrier to provide the records and the so-called ""running location"" of that different telephone, going forward, to assist in finding dorisca and to investigate cassio.the carrier was required to provide detective williams with the cellular telephone's location every fifteen minutes prospectively.  the carrier ""pinged"" the telephone at fifteen-minute intervals, an action that is not routinelypage 23undertaken by cellular telephone carriers.the defense expert explained that the ""ping"" sends a communication signal to the cellular telephone and requires the cellular telephone to communicate with the nearby cell tower.  see generally commonwealth v. augustine, 467 mass. at 237-238.  the carrier can identify the location of the cell tower by coordinates of longitude and latitude.  the carrier then sends, in this case to detective williams, this information and the maximum distance the cellular telephone can be from that cell tower, based on the strength and location of nearby cell towers.the csli records showed that the defendant, not desops, was the subscriber of the cellular telephone that cassio was then using.  the billing address on those records was 220-222 howard street, apartment 2.  the records also reflected that the defendant had yet another cellular telephone number.state police trooper eric telford assisted in the homicide investigation.  he knocked on doors, spoke to family members, and tried to obtain information about individuals close to dorisca.  on the evening of july 2, 2008, trooper telford was contacted by a confidential informant.  the informant told trooper telford that cassio was headed to florida in a brown toyota rav4 sport utility vehicle (suv) rental to pick up a large quantity of narcotics.  as a result, trooper telford thought that dorisca may intend to hide out in florida.from july 2 to july 8, 2008, detective williams confirmed, through csli data, that cassio, allonce, and the defendant made a trip to florida.  the csli data also showed that the cellular telephone was traveling south toward florida and came to a stop in sunrise, florida.  when the signal was stationary in sunrise, detective williams contacted the local police.  using the csli data, the sunrise police found a brown toyota, with a massachusetts registration, and through additional surveillance and communication with massachusetts police, identified cassio, allonce, and the defendant as the three individuals using the toyota.  onpage 24july 7, 2008, the csli data indicated that the cellular telephone was moving north.  when the telephone was shut off for a period of time during the trip, detective williams could not track it.on july 8, 2008, detective williams again began receiving csli information as the toyota approached the massachusetts border.  he alerted the brockton and the randolphpolice that the toyota was returning to the area.  at 2:15 p.m., detective williams was notified that the telephone pinged at or near howard street.  trooper telford and state police trooper francis walls, together with other officers, arrived at 220 howard street shortly after this ping was received.trooper telford observed cassio standing in front of the howard street building with an individual who matched dorisca's description.  he watched cassio and the other individual get into the toyota and drive away.  troopers telford and walls followed.  when the driver made a left turn without using a directional signal, the troopers stopped the toyota.  the driver was identified as cassio and the passenger was identified as allonce, not dorisca.  the two stated that the defendant had been traveling with them, that they had just come from his house, and that they were going to the brockton police department to speak to detective williams about the homicide.  the toyota was filled with clothing, luggage, a pillow, a cooler, and other items.  trooper telford had the two occupants step out of the toyota so they could check for dorisca.  when trooper telford confirmed dorisca was not hiding in the toyota, he permitted cassio and allonce to continue on their way.  ping data that detective williams received showed that the cellular telephone came to rest near the brockton police station at about 3:45 p.m. on july 8, 2008.troopers telford and walls returned to 220 howard street to look for dorisca, to find and speak to the defendant, and to investigate the possible drug connection to the property.  trooper telford directed other officers to that location to assist him.  when troopers telford, walls, and jackson arrived, they approached a man on the front porch.  as trooper walls began to speak to him, a female and a male came out of the first-floor apartment.  while trooper telford walked around to the rear of the house, trooper walls explained to the couple that the police were looking for a homicide suspect and that they thought that he might be inside their apartment.  the couple agreed to allow both troopers insidepage 25and walked them through every room of their apartment.  the troopers were taken through the back door to the exit, which opened into a common rear entry area.  there was a door to the outside from that common area, as well as stairs to the second and third floors.troopers walls and jackson used the rear stairs to go to the second-floor apartment, where the occupant of that apartment met them in the hallway.  they repeated their request and were again granted permission to look for dorisca in that apartment.  finding nothing, both troopers continued to the attic.  at the top of the stairs there was a large open landing area, without any door.  off of the landing area, there were four doors, which led to two bedrooms, a storage area, and a crawl space.  the only way to secure the attic would be to lock the entry door located in the common area on the first floor.  three of the four doors in the attic were open and the troopers looked in each space.  a television was in the front bedroom, and junk was piled in the storage room.  there was no bathroom or shower on this floor.the troopers knocked on the closed, fourth door several times before the defendant opened it and came into the landing area.  they asked the defendant his name and, when he told them, they asked if he had a nickname; he said it was paco.  because trooper walls knew paco was a name related to the drug investigation trooper telford was working on, he contacted trooper telford and asked him to come up to the attic.  in the meantime, troopers jackson and walls explained that they were looking for dorisca.  they obtained the defendant's verbal permission to do a quick walk-through of the defendant's room, which turned up nothing significant.  the defendant said he lived there and was paying $400 in rent per month.trooper telford, who had been outside, walked through the rear entry door to the common hallway and came up the back stairs to the attic.  trooper telford read the defendant his miranda rights and explained to him why the troopers were there.  the defendant said that he had gone to florida with his friends to attend a family reunion for allonce.  the defendant denied having any drugs in his room and signed a consent to search form.during the subsequent search, police found about $2,200 in a cupboard in the defendant's bedroom.  after a narcotics-trained dog arrived in the attic, police located a pillowcase in the crawl space that contained about two kilograms of what police believed to be cocaine.  that pillowcase matched a pillowcase found in the toyota.  the defendant denied any knowledge of the contraband.page 26based on this evidence, the third motion judge ruled that the defendant had standing to challenge the search because the tracking continued while the police searched 220 howard street.  the judge also determined that the defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy under art. 14 of the massachusetts declaration of rights was violated where the police tracked his ""movements for seven days through the collection of csli obtained from a cell phone registered to him but used by [another].""  with respect to the search, the judge agreed with the commonwealth that no warrant was required to obtain subscriber information from the carrier.  however, the judge determined that under commonwealth v. augustine, 467 mass. at 257, the failure of the commonwealth to acquire a warrant for the csli rendered that evidence illegally obtained.  the judge found that because the police learned, only through the unlawful csli, that the cocaine was likely brought to howard street, their seizure of the cocaine was the result of ""exploiting the unlawful electronic tracking through csli.""  the judge further found that ""[t]he search and seizure was not attenuated"" from the illegality and thus ""[t]he evidence obtained during that search must therefore be suppressed.""discussion.  in reviewing a judge's ruling on a motion to suppress, ""we accept the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error 'but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.'""  commonwealth v. scott,, 646 (2004), quoting from commonwealth v. jimenez,, 218 (2002).1.  standing.  on appeal, the commonwealth does not dispute that the csli was illegally obtained.  rather, the commonwealth argues that the defendant does not have standing to challenge the search of the cellular telephone.where a defendant claims the search of the cellular telephone violated his rights under art. 14 and the fourth and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution, we must determine initially whether the defendant has ""standing to contest the search and then whether [he] had an expectation of privacy in the area searched.""  commonwealth v. williams,, 207-208 (2009).  ""although the two concepts are interrelated, we consider them separately. . . .  a defendant has standing either if [he] has a possessory interest in the place searched or in the property seized or if [he] was present when the search occurred.""  id. at 208.  here, regardless of whether the defendant allowed cassio to use the cellular telephone, because the defendant waspage 27the registered owner of the telephone and the billing address was his, he had a possessory interest in the telephone sufficient to grant him automatic standing.  he also had actual standing because his movements were being tracked when the telephone was pinged by the carrier during the trip he took with cassio to florida.there also was a search in the constitutional sense.  the defendant has a reasonable expectation not to be subjected to extended csli tracking by the government, even if he is merely a passenger in a vehicle controlled by the primary suspect.  the government's monitoring of the defendant's movements -- for more than six days -- is sufficient to establish that he has standing to challenge the validity of the search of the cellular telephone.  commonwealth v. rousseau,, 382 (2013).2.  exclusionary rule.  the commonwealth argues alternatively, that the csli information was so attenuated from the seizure of the inculpatory evidence that suppression is not required.  specifically, the commonwealth argues that the evidence subsequently seized from the howard street attic ought not to be excluded because it is too attenuated from the illegality.  the commonwealth's concession is based on augustine, where the court held that government-compelled production of csli data by cellular telephone carriers is a search in the constitutional sense, requiring a warrant under art. 14.  467 mass. at 252-255.we pause to note that the csli ordered to be produced in augustine involved historical csli, which was generated from telephone calls already made to or from the cellular telephone in question.  the related records, which show the cell towers from which connection to telephone calls were made, and through which the locus of the cellular telephone's location can be pinpointed, are maintained by the carrier in the ordinary course of business.  id. at 239-240 & n.24.  the § 2703(d) order obtained in this case required the carrier to create csli that was not routinely created or retained.  that is, the carrier was required to prospectively ping a cellular telephone every fifteen minutes for morepage 28than six days, solely for the purpose of finding and providing location information for the police.  there is no question that under the rationale of augustine, a warrant was also required in this case, where the carrier not only was compelled to turn over csli data, but to create particular prospective csli that it otherwise would not have created.  see id. at 240 n.24 (""the privacy interest raised by historical csli may be the same as prospective, or 'real-time,' csli"").because a warrant for the particular evidence from the cellular telephone registered to the defendant was required but not obtained, the ""crucial question"" regarding whether the evidence must be suppressed as tainted fruit is whether it came ""by exploitation of . . . [the illegal search] or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.""  commonwealth v. estabrook,, 860 (2015) (citation omitted).  see commonwealth v. bradshaw,, 258 (1982), citing wong sun v. united states, 371 u.s. 471, 488 (1963).  relying on these principles, we consider the evidence at issue.in this case, the troopers first spoke to the defendant when he responded to their repeated knocking by opening the only closed door in the attic and entering the landing area.after the defendant gave permission to troopers walls and jackson to do a quick walk-through of his room for dorisca, trooper telford arrived and spoke to the defendant.  he read the defendant his miranda rights and then ""explained to him that [they] were there searching for [dorisca], who was a homicide suspect, and thatpage 29[they] also had information that he, and mr. azario [sic], and the other defendant there, allonce, had just gone down to florida and purchased a large amount of narcotics and they were possibly storing it there.""  this statement was based directly on the tainted csli and while it was intertwined with other independent evidence, the inquiry exploited the improperly obtained csli.  commonwealth v. estabrook, supra at 864-865.specifically, the police knew from a somewhat dated videotape that existed prior to the csli that cassio had traveled to florida to buy large amounts of narcotics.  in addition, they had statements from kennell that cassio was traveling to new york with the defendant and allonce.  they also had statements from an informant (who trooper telford had not previously used) that cassio (without reference to any other individuals) was going to florida to buy narcotics in a brown toyota.  they also knew from kennell that cassio was using a cellular telephone number that was registered to the defendant and was billed to 220 howard street.  the csli, however, provided the only direct and reliable evidence that the defendant had ""just"" participated in a trip to florida.  indeed, massachusetts authorities used the csli to direct police in sunrise, florida, to the location where the cellular telephone came to rest, and from where, through surveillance, identification details from the toyota and its occupants were relayed back.the commonwealth argues that the defendant's statements and the subsequent discovery of the evidence are admissible because they were attenuated from the initial illegal search of the csli.  we disagree for the reasons stated in commonwealth v. estabrook, supra.  the defendant was not confronted with any question based on his csli until he spoke with trooper telford, after the defendant answered the knock on his attic room door.  indeed, when trooper telford confronted the defendant with evidence of this tainted csli, including that the information that the defendant had just returned from florida, there is no evidence that the defendant was aware that the police knew he had traveled to florida.  insofar as the defendant is concerned, his statement and his consent to search, given ""in direct response to confrontation with evidence of his csli[,] were made in close proximity to the illegality, and there were no intervening circumstances between the police questions based on the csli and [the defendant's]page 30responses thereto.""ibid.  the defendant's statements therefore must be suppressed.  ""[t]he connection between the illegality and the granting of consent was 'sufficiently intimate' that the consent cannot be found to have been so attenuated from the [exploitation of the csli] as to be purged from its taint.""  commonwealth v. gentile,, 831 (2014).as for the cash found in the cupboard in the defendant's bedroom, there is certainly some question that the defendant was not being truthful when he said the room was his home, particularly given the lack of a bathroom or a shower.  nonetheless, the defendant kept it locked and he was inside when the police arrived.  for the reasons discussed supra, we conclude that the defendant's consent to search was tainted by the police exploitation of the illegally obtained csli and therefore, his statement to police before the search and the cash found in his bedroom must be suppressed.with respect to the search of the crawl space, however, the defendant's consent was not required.  the facts regarding the access to, use, and layout of the attic were carefully developed during the evidentiary hearings.  the crawl space was accessible to any tenant by entering through the ground level exterior door in the rear of the dwelling, which was apparently left unlocked, and walking up the stairs to the attic.  there, off of the main landing, were several rooms or areas with open doors, including the crawl space.  items found in the rooms with open doors suggested that tenants stored or disposed of possessions they did not need or want in that location.  the cocaine was found in a pillowcase in that attic crawl space.  because the crawl space was within this common area in a multiunit building, there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in items left there.  see commonwealth v. thomas,, 774-775 (1971); commonwealth v. montanez,, 302 (1991); commonwealth v. holley,, 551-552 (2011).  see also commonwealth v. connolly,, 624, cert. denied, 400 u.s. 843 (1970) (""since the basement was a common area freely available to all the tenants, one tenant could give permission to its search"").  as a matter of law, the police were permittedpage 31to search the crawl space without the defendant's consent and without a warrant.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. williams, 453 mass. at 209 (because defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in space searched, he ""cannot challenge the police action that occurred there"").  the cocaine therefore, need not be suppressed.we address one outstanding issue.  when this case was remanded in 2015 by the single justice, it was with the instruction to consider the defendant's motion to suppress in light of several recently decided cases, specifically commonwealth v. augustine.  despite this instruction, neither the commonwealth nor the third motion judge addressed that portion of augustine in which the court considered whether the § 2703(d) application provided probable cause to obtain the csli and, if so, the failure to seek a warrant to obtain csli would not require suppression of that evidence.  467 mass. at 255-256.  nor did the commonwealth raise the issue in its brief on appeal, although the matter was briefly touched on at oral argument, over the defendant's objection.  because of the lengthy and somewhat unusual procedural posture of this case and the specific instruction from the single justice to consider augustine, we address the issue in the interest of judicial economy.  see commonwealth v. beale,, 1024 n.1 (2001).here, the only detailed statement in detective williams's affidavit accompanying the § 2703(d) application for the csli reads:  ""the current and recent location of cassio vertil is necessary and important to my investigation because other witnesses and obtained phone records indicate that cassio vertil has been, and continues to provide aid and support to the indicted josener dorisca.""  the statement fails to identify the witnesses and does not identify the requisite basis for assessing their reliability or their veracity.  see commonwealth v. burt,, 710 (1985) (discussing various kinds of informers and witnesses).  similarly, the particular ""phone records"" are not identified and detective williams did not articulate how those records reveal that cassio provided aid and support to dorisca.  contrast, e.g., commonwealth v. lopes,, 164-165 (2009).  this conclusory statement is so bereft of the factual details required to establish probable cause that, unlike the situation presented in augustine, we need not remand the matter to the trial court for further findings.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. moran,, 169-170 (1967) (distinguishing between facts andpage 32conclusions).conclusion.  so much of the order as allowed the defendant's motion to suppress with respect to the cocaine is reversed.  in all other respects, the order is affirmed.so ordered.",criminal,0.0,0.0
1625,"cedar-fieldstone marketplace, lp  vs.  t.s. fitness, inc.,& another.","guaranty.  contract, lease of real estate, release from liability, to guarantee rent payments.  release.  real property, lease.this court concluded that an agreement for judgment in a summary process action, which contained a release of a landlord's claims against a tenant for unpaid rent pursuant to a lease, did not preclude the landlord from bringing a collection action against a guarantor of the lease, where the express terms of the guaranty made plain that the guaranty was intended to provide the landlord a means of collecting unpaid rent from the guarantor up to the agreed-to cap, that the landlord's rights under the guaranty were intended to exist independent of the landlord's rights to collect unpaid rents from the tenant, and that the parties intended that the guaranty would not be affected by future contingencies regarding the lease, such as a decision by the landlord to compromise a collection action against the tenant. [35-38]","in this case, we consider whether the release of a landlord's claims against a tenant for unpaid rent pursuant to a lease precluded the landlord from bringing a collection action against a guarantor of the lease.  we conclude that it did not.background.  the defendant t.s. fitness, inc. (tenant), rented commercial property in new bedford from the plaintiff, cedar-fieldstone marketplace, lp (landlord).  in 2011, those parties agreed to a modification of the then-existing lease between them.  to secure the tenant's payment obligations under the modifiedpage 34lease, the tenant's president, the defendant thomas w. sheridan, executed a personal guaranty, which was memorialized in a detailed, three-page document.  under the terms of the guaranty, sheridan's liability was ""co-extensive with that of [the t]enant,"" except that it was capped at a specified amount, $52,271.06.  the existence of that cap appears to explain why the document is captioned a limited guaranty.except for the cap on his liability, sheridan's obligations under the guaranty are set forth expansively, as we will review in detail later.  the guaranty states that ""[n]o waiver or modification of any provision of this [g]uaranty nor any termination of the [g]uaranty shall be effective unless in writing, signed by [the l]andlord.""after the lease modification, the tenant subsequently defaulted on the lease, prompting the landlord to bring a summary process action against it in district court.  that action was resolved through an agreement for judgment in february of 2013.  the parties to the agreement for judgment were the parties to the summary process action, that is, the landlord and the tenant.  sheridan himself signed the agreement for judgment, but he did so in his capacity as president of the tenant.the essence of the agreement for judgment was that the landlord allowed the tenant to occupy the premises for an additional three months, and that the tenant agreed to vacate the premises after that and to make agreed-to monthly use and occupancy payments in the interim.  the body of the agreement for judgment included a paragraph through which the tenant expressly (and broadly) released its potential claims against the landlord.  curiously, there is no corresponding provision that addresses what claims the landlord agreed to release.  however, in prefatory ""whereas"" clauses, there is language that could be taken to suggest that the agreement for judgment was intended to resolve the entirety of the dispute between the parties.after the agreement for judgment had been executed, the landlord brought a collection action in superior court againstpage 35both the tenant and sheridan seeking over $100,000 in unpaid rent.  relying on the prefatory language quoted in note 3, supra, a superior court judge (first motion judge) ruled, as a matter of law, that the agreement for judgment barred the landlord's only count (breach of contract) against the tenant.that count eventually was dismissed, and the landlord took no appeal from that ruling when the judgment ultimately issued.however, a second superior court judge (second motion judge) ruled on summary judgment that the landlord's counts against sheridan as guarantor were not similarly barred.because it was undisputed that the unpaid rent exceeded the specified amount that sheridan had agreed to guarantee ($52,271.06),the second motion judge granted summary judgment in the landlord's favor against sheridan in that amount.  accordingly, judgment issued ordering sheridan to pay the landlord $52,271.06, plus attorney's fees and costs.sheridan appealed, arguing that he no longer could be liable under the guaranty once the tenant's underlying liability was resolved by the agreement for judgment.  we affirm.discussion.  for purposes of our analysis, we will assume, without deciding, that the first motion judge was correct to conclude that the agreement for judgment barred the landlord's collection count against the tenant.  the limited issue we face is whether, based on that premise, the landlord's counts against sheridan as guarantor also were barred.the argument that sheridan makes on appeal is a narrow one.  it is undisputed that sheridan himself was not a party to the agreementpage 36for judgment, and he makes no claim that he was an intended third-party beneficiary of it.thus, sheridan is not claiming that when the parties terminated the summary process action through the agreement for judgment, they in fact agreed that his obligations as guarantor had been released as part of a comprehensive settlement.  rather, he argues that once the tenant no longer was liable under the lease, he automatically was relieved of his guaranty obligations as a matter of law.he bases this contention on what he characterizes as the ""black letter legal principle that a guarantor's obligations are coextensive with those of the principal obligor.""  we are unpersuaded.to be sure, the cases do recite that ""the liability of the guarantor cannot exceed the liability of the debtor.""  see 275 washington st. corp. v. hudson river intl., llc,, 30 (2013).  however, that principle is of more limited application than sheridan warrants.  it stands for the straightforward proposition that a guarantor's own liability is bounded by the scope of the underlying liability that he has guaranteed.thus, in the case at hand, sheridan's liability under the guaranty could not exceed the tenant's payment obligations that arose under the terms of the lease.  see ibid.  however, it is a different question altogether whether a subsequent negotiated compromise of such underlyingpage 37liability affected sheridan's obligations as guarantor of the tenant's lease obligations.we consider it self-evident that parties negotiating the terms of a guaranty would be free to agree that a subsequent release of a principal obligor's underlying debt would result in a discharge of the guarantor's own obligations.  but we see nothing in the case law or elsewhere that requires such a term as a matter of law.  put differently, we see no legal bar to a guarantor's agreeing -- as part of the negotiated terms of a guaranty -- that his obligation to fund the underlying debt would survive a settlement of that debt between the principal obligor and the recipient of the guaranty.  rather, what the parties to a guaranty agree to in this regard is simply a matter of contractual intent.  after all, ""[a] guaranty is a contract 'like all other contracts.'""  federal financial co. v. savage,, 817 (2000), quoting from merchants natl. bank v. stone,, 250 (1936).  accordingly, ""[t]he liability of a guarantor is to be ascertained from the terms of the written instrument by which the obligation is expressed, construed according to the usual rules of interpretation.""  agricultural natl. bank of pittsfield v. brennan,, 327 (1936).turning from theory to practice, we are left with little doubt about the intent of the parties here.  the express terms of the guaranty can best be described as ""unforgiving"" to sheridan.  the guaranty is denominated as ""absolute and unconditional,"" and sheridan's liability is made joint and several with that of the tenant.  moreover, the guaranty states that there are no procedural steps that the landlord must take as preconditions to its seeking recovery from sheridan (such as first seeking recovery from the tenant).  it also makes plain that sheridan's obligations survive even if the tenant is unable to make payment by reason of bankruptcy or mere insolvency.  in addition, while the guaranty does not directly address the specific contingency of a settlement between the landlord and the tenant, it does include the following expansive language that encompasses such a scenario:""[t]he liability of [sheridan] hereunder shall in no way be affected, modified or diminished by reason of . . . any consent, release[,] indulgence or other action, inaction or omission under or in respect of the [l]ease, or . . . any dealings or transactions or matter or thing occurring between [the l]andlord and [the t]enant.""page 38finally, the guaranty recites that ""[a]ll of [the l]andlord's rights and remedies under the [l]ease and under this [g]uaranty, now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise, are intended to be distinct, separate and cumulative and no exercise or partial exercise of any such right or remedy therein or herein mentioned is intended to be in exclusion of or a waiver of any of the others.""through the express terms just quoted, it is plain that the guaranty was intended to provide the landlord a lock-tight means for collecting unpaid rent from sheridan (up to the agreed-to cap).  it is similarly plain that the landlord's rights under the guaranty were intended to exist independent of the landlord's rights to collect unpaid rent from the tenant, and that the parties intended that the guaranty would not be affected by future contingencies regarding the lease (including, for example, a decision by the landlord to compromise a collection action against the tenant).  our conclusion is also consistent ""with the well-established rule that the 'liability of the guarantor. . . can be terminated only in accordance with the terms of the contract.'""  federal financial co. v. savage, supra, quoting from merchants natl. bank v. stone, supra at 252.in sum, the terms of the guaranty are plain, thereby rendering the landlord's guaranty claim amenable to resolution on summary judgment.  see lumber mut. ins. co. v. zoltek corp.,, 707 (1995) (the interpretation of an unambiguous contract presents a question of law appropriate for summary judgment).  because it is undisputed that the unpaid rent exceeded the amount of the guaranty, the second motion judge correctly entered summary judgment in the landlord's favor requiring sheridan to pay the amount he had agreed to guarantee.judgment

which governs actions to compel the removal of a structure because of alleged zoning violations - commenced at the time that the lot containing the primary house was conveyed, rather than at the endorsement of the approval not required (anr) subdivision plan.  as the land court judge concluded otherwise, we reverse that portion of the judgment and remand for further proceedings, while affirming the judge's denial of the brunos' request for attorney's fees and costs from the members of the board.1.  background.  the goethals and brunos separately own adjoining real property parcels, held in trust, located on goethals way in the town of tisbury.  the goethals' property (lot 1) and the brunos' property (lot 2) formerly comprised a single parcel (original lot), first purchased by the goethals family in or around the 1930's.  the original lot contained a single-family dwelling when the goethals purchased it, and they added a separate garage sometime prior to 1960.in 1978, the planning board of tisbury granted the goethals a special permit under the town zoning by-law (by-law) to build a detached guesthouse on the original lot.  as authorized by the special permit, the goethals constructed a guesthouse structure of approximately 850 square feet in place of the garage.  in or around 1986, the goethals performed additional work on the guesthouse, including the addition of two bedrooms and increasing the total area to 1,710 square feet.  there is no evidence that the 1986 addition was authorized by a building permit.on december 19, 2001, the planning board endorsed the goethals' plan to subdivide the original lot into two parcels, lot 1 and lot 2, with approval not required (anr) under g. l. c. 41, § 81l.  under the subdivision plan, lot 1 measured approximatelypage 5012,350 square feet and contained the guesthouse, and lot 2 measured approximately 32,200 square feet and contained the original single-family dwelling.  both lots are in tisbury's r-25 zoning district, which requires a minimum lot size of 25,000 square feet for a single-family dwelling, well in excess of the square feet assigned to lot 1.lot 1 and lot 2 remained in common ownership following the anr subdivision, until the goethals conveyed lot 2 to the brunos by deed dated august 17, 2005, and recorded two weeks later.  under the terms of the conveyance, the goethals reserved easements for their family and guests granting access across a portion of the brunos' property to use the beach.  after the 2005 conveyance, the goethals maintained ownership of lot 1.in 2010, the goethals converted a television room in the former guesthouse into a bedroom, bringing the number of bedrooms to five.  the goethals did not seek any permits or authorization for this work.  the lots are subject to the ""coastal district and barrier beach regulations"" (coastal district regulations) incorporated into the by-law, which limit dwellings to three bedrooms and a maximum occupancy of five persons.since 2006, the goethals have rented or attempted to rent their house for up to eight weeks each july and august.  they have advertised it sometimes as a three-bedroom vacation home and sometimes as a five-bedroom vacation home sleeping up to ten guests.apparently displeased with the guesthouse expansion and rental use, the brunos complained to the goethals and town officials concerning the zoning nonconformities and violations.  in september, 2013, the brunos submitted a letter to the town zoning enforcement officer, requesting enforcement of the by-law prohibiting the presence of a single-family house on an undersized lot.on january 8, 2014, the town zoning enforcement officer denied the brunos' request on the basis that the six-year statute of limitations under g. l. c. 40a, § 7, barred enforcement.  the brunospage 51appealed the decision to the board, which unanimously affirmed on the same statute of limitations grounds, while finding the house in nonconformity with the by-law.on may 2, 2014, the brunos filed a complaint and later an amended complaint in the land court pursuant to g. l. c. 40a, §§ 7 and 17, to annul the board's determination, compel the removal of the goethals' house, and award them attorney's fees and costs.on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, the judge concluded that the ten-year statute of limitations in § 7, rather than the six-year statute of limitations in the same section, applied.the judge then determined that the by-law violations commenced in 2001 with the anr subdivision endorsement -

""zoning violations arising from nonconformities may be stayed by the doctrine of merger, 'which treats adjacent lots currently in common ownership as a single lot for zoning purposes so as to minimize nonconformities.'""  palitz, 470 mass. at 800, quoting from marinelli v. board of appeals of stoughton,, 261 (2003).  as a result, even though the anr subdivision created nonconforming lots, the tisbury zoning enforcement officer could not have pursued an enforcement action against the goethals until the time of the conveyance.  see palitz, 470 mass. at 800 (""absent a variance, alienation of one of the nonconforming properties will result inof the zoning violations by the new owner"" [emphasis supplied]).  see also carabetta, 73 mass. app. ct. at 271 n.10 (conveyance severing common ownership ""demerged"" adjacent lots, and resulted in purchase of nonconforming lot subject to enforcement).page 54the statute of limitations in § 7 applies as equally to town enforcement actions as it does to private lawsuits.  if we construed the statute of limitations as commencing upon the anr endorsement, any property owner could obtain an anr endorsement for a subdivision plan and then wait ten years to separate the lots, thus creating nonconforming lots without any opportunity for the town to enforce its zoning by-law.  our construction, by contrast, allows the town ten years after the lots are separated to enforce its zoning by-law, consistent with the legislature's intent.the 2001 anr subdivision did not create an enforceable zoning violation; such a violation was created only when the goethals conveyed lot 2 to the brunos in august, 2005.under § 7, the brunos were required to commence and record their action within ten years of that date.  the brunos brought their action on may 2, 2014.  if they effectively recorded their action on april 30, 2015, as they claim,their claims are not barred by § 7.  accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.4.  attorney's fees and costs.  there is no basis for the assessment of attorney's fees and costs against the board members in this case.  general laws c. 40a, § 17, inserted by st. 1975, c. 808, § 3, provides that ""[c]osts shall not be allowed against the board or special permit granting authority unless it shall appear to the court that the board or special permit granting authority in making the decision appealed from acted with gross negligence, in bad faith or with malice.""  generally, there can be no finding of bad faith in the absence of evidence of improper motives, harassment, or causing needless delay or unnecessary cost.  sheehan v. zoning bd. of appeals of plymouth,, 61-62 (2005).here, the record does not show any harassment or delay, nor negligence of any kind on the part of the board.  the brunos' allegations of bad faith and gross negligence are without merit, if not frivolous, and the judge properly denied their request underpage 55§ 17.5.  conclusion.  the ten-year statute of limitations under g. l. c. 40a, § 7, commenced no earlier than august 17, 2005.  so much of the judgment granting the goethals' motion for summary judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  so much of the judgment as denies attorney's fees and costs against the board members under g. l. c. 40a, § 17, is affirmed.so ordered.",civil,Gordon H.

[60-64]this court vacated a criminal defendant's convictions of illegal possession of a firearm and of carrying a loaded firearm without a license and set aside the findings, where a superior court judge failed to conduct the required colloquy before proceeding with the trial based on stipulated facts. [64]","this case raises an issue as to the reasonableness of police conduct when the police engaged with, and ultimately stopped and seized, persons walking in a public area.  the defendant appeals from his convictions of illegal possession of a firearm and carrying a loaded firearm without a license, claimingpage 57that (1) the firearm was seized in violation of the fourth amendment to the united states constitution and art. 14 of the massachusetts declaration of rights, and (2) the trial judge failed to conduct the necessary waiver colloquy before convicting the defendant based upon stipulated facts.  because, as the commonwealth acknowledges, the required colloquy did not occur, the judgments must be vacated and the findings set aside.that leaves the search and seizure issue, which has been fully briefed and argued and which bears on any future proceedings.  see commonwealth v. monteiro,, 289 (2009).  the seizure of the gun resulted from what began as a ""casual"" encounter between the defendant, his two companions, and the northeastern university (university) police, outdoors on a september afternoon in the middle of the university's campus.  the defendant contends that he and his companions were stopped or seized, for constitutional purposes, without the required reasonable suspicion, and that the gun accordingly must be suppressed.  a superior court judge denied the defendant's pretrial motion to suppress the gun, concluding that the initial conversations with police were consensual and that no stop occurred until after the police officers had observed a knife on the defendant's person, at which point the seizure became entirely justified.  we conclude that although the initial actions of the police were reasonable, the police unreasonably extended the encounter, and then seized the defendant before the knife appeared and without the requisite reasonable suspicion.1.  background.  a. facts.this case arises, as our cases often do, out of ordinary police work that developed into a seizure and, ultimately, an arrest.  on september 23, 2015, officers john sweeney, jonathan sprague, and andrew good of the university police were working a day shift.  officers sweeney and sprague were on mountain bicycles, while officer good was driving a marked police car.  these three officers were wearing university police uniforms.at 3:20 p.m., all three officers heard a radio broadcast stating, ""two black males in their early 20's, one wearing a black hoody, and the other wearing a gray hoody, possibly with a third person,page 58casing the bike racks by snell [l]ibrary"" at the university.  this information was initially provided by a security officer employed by the university, who was stationed by the bicycle racks because the area was a high-crime area for bicycle theft.approximately twenty minutes after the broadcast, officer good saw two men fitting the broadcast description, along with a female, pass his car from the direction of the library.  the three people in the group were the defendant, the other male, dakari ferguson-boone, and the female, dajunnay wade-joseph.the defendant and ferguson-boone were seated on bicycles, although wade-joseph had no bicycle and the three were walking together.  officer good got out of his car and called out to the group, asking if he could speak to them, but they continued to move away.officers sprague and sweeney then approached the group.  officer sweeney said hello and asked if he could speak to the three.  although the exact details and timing of the ensuing conversations are not spelled out in the judge's findings, initially the officers stated to the group that there had been a number of bicycle thefts in the area, and asked where the group was coming from.  the companions responded that they had eaten at popeye's, a restaurant in the campus food court; at least one of the group was carrying a container from that restaurant.soon thereafter a third officer arrived, officer jim cooney, and three separate conversations ensued, in close proximity.  officer sprague spoke with the defendant, officer sweeney spoke with ferguson-boone, and officer cooney with wade-joseph.  the motion judge found that ""[t]he officers' tone of voice was casual, conversational, and nonthreatening.""  the officers asked the two men to get off the bicycles and they complied, placing the bicycles on the ground.  the officers asked whether the men had stolen the bicycles, and they responded that they had not.officer sprague asked the defendant if he had previously had issues with the police, and he responded by raising his pant leg, revealing a gps-monitored ankle bracelet.  officer sprague then asked the defendant for identification, and the other two officers followed suit, asking for identification from ferguson-boone and wade-joseph.  the defendant did not produce identification, but did orally provide his name, date of birth and address.  officer sprague then stepped a short distance away from the group to callpage 59in the defendant's information to police dispatch, in order to conduct a criminal history and warrant check.  ferguson-boone provided some form of identification card, which officer sweeney took and held, waiting for officer sprague to complete his conversation with dispatch.  wade-joseph produced her university student identification card.  while these conversations were occurring, officer good and another officer came on the scene but ""stood a distance away from the ongoing conservations.""as officer sprague was calling in the defendant's information, officer sweeney observed the defendant make a movement to his left side, causing his sweatshirt to ride up and expose a knife clipped inside of his waistband.  officer sweeney, ""concerned for his and other officers' safety[,] grabbed the knife handle to remove it.""officer cooney then told the defendant to place his hands on his head because he intended to conduct a patfrisk.  the defendant began to comply, but then fled, chased by officer good.  while fleeing, the defendant dropped the firearm that is the subject of the motion to suppress.the motion judge did not make a finding as to how long the encounter lasted from the time the officers first engaged the group until the defendant fled.  the witnesses gave a range of estimates, but the record reflects that the encounter was approximately ten to fifteen minutes.the defendant was ultimately located and arrested, and charged with illegal possession of a firearm, in violation of g. l. c. 269, § 10(a); illegal possession of ammunition, in violation of g. l. c. 269, § 10(h)(1); and carrying a loaded firearm without a license (fid card), in violation of g. l. c. 269, § 10(n).b.  pretrial proceedings.  the defendant filed a motion to suppress all items seized.  after an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge denied the defendant's motion, finding that ""[t]he initial encounter was not a stop or seizure"" prior to the time the officer saw and seized the knife.  the judge stated that asking the defendant for biographical information did not effect a seizure, and continued, ""the fact that there were three officers speaking to the defendant and his friends does not make the consensual encounter a seizure.  each officer spoke separately to [the defendant] and his two friends.  [officers] good and cooney did not engage in conversation and stood about 100 yards from the interaction.""finally, the judge concluded that the seizure of the knife was justified because it was a dangerous weapon on school grounds.  see g. l. c. 269, § 10(j).page 60c.  trial.  after a bench trial upon stipulated facts, the trial judge found the defendant guilty of all three charges and allowed the commonwealth's dismissal of the charge of possession of ammunition without an fid card.  this appeal followed.2.  discussion.  a.  motion to suppress.  we deal first with the motion to suppress.  the defendant's principal contention is that he and his two companions were stopped or seized for constitutional purposes well before officer sweeney saw the knife on the defendant's person, that this initial stop or seizure was not justified by reasonable suspicion and was thus unlawful, and that the gun, and the defendant's arrest, are the fruits of that unlawful stop or seizure.  the commonwealth counters that the initial encounter was merely a field interrogation observation (fio) -- an informal and voluntary conversation with the police that the defendant and his friends were free to exit.  the motion judge agreed with the commonwealth, concluding that no stop occurred until the officer saw and seized the knife, at which point a seizure was fully justified.i.  stop and seizure.  the first issue is when the stop or seizure occurred for constitutional purposes under the above facts.  the legal standard is well settled:  whether, ""in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed he was not free to leave.""  commonwealth v. meneus,, 234-235 (2017), quoting from commonwealth v. barros,, 173-174 (2001).  in applying this standard, ""we accept the [motion] judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error.""  commonwealth v. contos,, 32 (2001), quoting from commonwealth v. eckert,, 592 (2000).  accord commonwealth v. lyles,, 814 (2009).  ""however, we review independently the motion judge's application of constitutional principles to the facts found.""  commonwealth v. franklin,, 820 (2010).the case law makes clear that police are free to approach persons on the street, to engage in conversation, and to ask questions of them, without such encounters raising constitutional issues.  the police are not different from ordinary persons in this regard.  the persons approached, of course, have no obligation to respond and are free to walk away.  if the police communicate otherwise -- by word or action -- that the person they are speaking to is not free to terminate the conversation or to walk away, then the situation changes and reasonable suspicion, at least, is required.  in applying the ""free to leave"" standard, courtspage 61evaluate whether the police have applied coercive power, such that a person's liberty to walk away has been materially restrained.  see barros, 435 mass. at 174-176.the question is an objective one, based upon the totality of the circumstances, and although the answer in any particular case is necessarily fact-dependent, we have some helpful guide posts.  in lyles, 453 mass. at 813-814, the supreme judicial court held that where a police officer asks for and obtains an identification card (id card) from a subject, a ""seizure"" has occurred for constitutional purposes -- at least while the officer retains the id card.  the court reasoned that given the importance of identification, such as a driver's license, in today's society, a person who has relinquished his identification would not feel free to terminate the encounter and leave.  see id. at 815-816.  nor would such a person feel that he could demand that the identification be immediately returned.  see also barros, 435 mass. at 175-176 (officer's follow-up command to ""come here"" sufficient to constitute a stop); commonwealth v. depina,, 241-242 (2010); commonwealth v. evans,, 689-693 (2015).on the facts here we conclude that a stop occurred, for constitutional purposes, at least by the time the officers secured identification from each of the companions and began calling in that information so that record checks could take place.  by that point, what began as an informal ""field interrogation"" had crossed the line into a coercive exercise of police power.  the men had been asked to alight from their bicycles.  the interrogation had lasted for several minutes and had taken on a more formal character, with three separate conversations ongoing.  and once identification was requested, received, and called in, we do not believe any of the subjects, objectively, would reasonably have felt free to leave.  see id. at 690.  under lyles, a stop and seizure had clearly occurred with respect to each of the defendant's companions, and we do not think the defendant's circumstances were materially different.  he had provided his personal information orally, and officer sprague was engaged in calling it in.  see lyles, 453 mass. at 813-816.  our conclusion is buttressed by officer sprague's testimony that while he was calling in to dispatch, the other officers were ""keeping their eye"" on the defendant and ferguson-boone ""so that neither . . . would leave while [officer sprague] was getting that information.""ii.  reasonable suspicion.  having concluded that a stop occurred for constitutional purposes prior to the observation of thepage 62knife, the next question is whether, at the time of the stop, the police had the requisite reasonable suspicion.  under our cases, a stop requires reasonable suspicion of identifiable criminal activity -- ""that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.""  commonwealth v. sykes,, 314 (2007), quoting from commonwealth v. silva,, 405 (1974).  we conclude that at the time of the stop, the officers lacked such reasonable suspicion.when the police first approached the group they knew (1) that there had been a report, then twenty minutes old, that two men had been observed ""casing"" the university's bicycle racks, (2) that the two men in the group matched the description given, and (3) that those two men were now on bicycles.on the above facts it was surely reasonable for the officers to approach the men to investigate possible bicycle theft, which is what the officers did.  they approached and asked, inter alia, questions directed to how the men had obtained the bicycles.  indeed, the officers did so initially without effecting a stop or seizure in the constitutional sense; the initial questioning was consensual and noncoercive.  but importantly, over the next several minutes they learned nothing that could have added to their suspicions.  the men stated the bicycles were not stolen.  one of the group was a student at the university, and their explanation that they had been in the food court was readily verifiable from the food they carried.  and the police testified, at the motion to suppress hearing, both that they had no reason to disbelieve the men and that they had no knowledge that any bicycle theft had occurred.at that point, once the police had knowledge that the bicycles were not stolen, they had no basis to effect a constitutional seizure because there was not then a reasonable basis to believe that a crime had occurred, or was likely to occur.  the only possible criminal activity they were aware of involved bicycle theft.  but they had no information that bicycle theft had actually occurred, and while observed ""casing"" can, of course, be a basis for a stop, there must be reasonable suspicion at the time of the stop that a crime is likely to occur.  see terry v. ohio, 392 u.s. 1, 6 (1968).  here, there was no sign that a theft was likely -- the men were encountered some distance from and moving away frompage 63the bicycle racks, with lunch in their hands.  if any ""casing"" had occurred previously, it had plainly ended some time ago.the touchstone of search and seizure law is reasonableness, and in this context reasonableness has at least two dimensions -- the reasonableness of initiating an encounter, and the reasonableness of the scope of the encounter.  see commonwealth v. gomes,, 509 (2009), quoting from commonwealth v. wilson,, 393-394 (2004) (""in 'stop and frisk' cases our inquiry is two-fold:  first, whether the initiation of the investigation by the police was permissible in the circumstances and, second, whether the scope of the search was  justified by the circumstances"").  here, there was no sound basis for the police to extend the encounter beyond its initial purpose by requesting identification and conducting a criminal history or warrant check.  by the time the constitutional stop and seizure occurred, reasonable suspicion was lacking.just recently in commonwealth v. cordero,(2017), the supreme judicial court expressed a similar principle in the context of a traffic stop that turned into an arrest for possession of drugs.  there, the police lawfully stopped the defendant for a broken taillight, broken brake lights, and an impermissible degree of window tint.  see id. at 242.  however, the police prolonged the stop by questioning the driver about his travel history that day, and maintained the stop well after the time needed to document the results of the traffic investigation.  see id. at 242-247.  the continued questioning, which included repeated requests to search the vehicle, ultimately resulted in a search of the vehicle's trunk, in which the officers found a considerable amount of what they believed to be heroin.  see id. at 240-241.the supreme judicial court concluded the drugs must be suppressed.  while the initial stop was lawful, ""[a] routine traffic stop may not last longer than 'reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.'""  id. at 241 (citation omitted).  the court stated:""ultimately, by the time the trooper finished discussing with the defendant the broken lights and the window tint, the investigation of the civil traffic violations was complete.  because this investigation did not give rise to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, the trooper did not have a legitimate basis to detain the defendant, and the defendant should have been allowed to drive away.""page 64id. at 247.in this case, the police exercised coercive power to effect the stop and seizure before they observed or knew anything of the knife in the defendant's waistband.  at the time they effected the stop they lacked reasonable suspicion of an existing or intended crime.  the defendant and his companions accordingly should have been left to move on.  the subsequent seizure of the knife, the defendant's flight, and the recovery of the gun are all fruits of the unlawful stop and should have been suppressed.b.  lack of colloquy before trial on stipulated facts.  finally, we note that the judgments would have had to be vacated regardless of our conclusion on the suppression issue, because the trial judge failed to conduct the required colloquy before proceeding with the trial based upon stipulated facts.  the defendant stipulated that the seized firearm had been in his ""exclusive possession,"" that it contained ammunition, and that he had no ""valid fid card.""  these facts constituted all the elements of the crime charged, and the stipulation was thus the equivalent of a guilty plea.  a judge may not conduct a trial on such stipulated facts without first having a colloquy to establish the defendant's knowing and voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights, including rights against self-incrimination and to confront the witnesses against him.  see commonwealth v. lewis,, 763-764 (1987).here, the trial judge conducted a colloquy regarding the defendant's waiver of trial by jury, but did not conduct the required colloquy regarding the defendant's stipulation to facts that established guilt.3.  conclusion.  the judgments are vacated, and the findings are set aside.so ordered.",criminal,Robert N.

[68-70]at the trial of an indictment charging possession with intent to distribute heroin, there was sufficient evidence that the substance the defendant possessed was heroin, in that the jury were entitled to resolve any inconsistencies in a police officer's testimony that the packets admitted at trial were the same ones that he confiscated from the defendant and in that the commonwealth established the authenticity of the evidence through the direct testimony of the officer who confiscated the packets from the defendant and through the testimony of another officer about the chain of custody of the bundles that contained the packets. [70-71]a superior court judge did not err in denying a criminal defendant's motion for a new trial, where the defendant's trial counsel was not ineffective for choosing to forgo an argument of insufficient merit, in that trial counsel made a reasonable tactical decision not to attack the chain of custody (particularly in view of the strength of the commonwealth's case) and instead focused on the weakness of the commonwealth's case (i.e., intent to distribute). [71-72]","following a jury trial in the superior court, the defendant, admiral sutherland, was convicted of possession with intent to distribute heroin.  thereafter, he pleaded guilty to a charge that it was a subsequent offense.  his motions for a new trial and for reconsideration were denied without a hearing.  on appeal, the defendant claims that the admission of improper so-called ""negative profiling"" evidence amounted to reversible error, that there was insufficient evidence that the substance was heroin, and that it was an abuse of discretion to deny his motion for new trial.  we affirm.background.  the jury could have found the following facts.  on september 11, 2010, massachusetts state police trooper luis rodriguez was conducting a community walk throughin springfield.  rodriguez noticed a black nissan being driven by the defendant, who he knew did not have a valid driver's license.  after the defendant parked the nissan, rodriguez arrested him for driving with a suspended license.  while searching the defendant, rodriguez found a package of cigarettes, which contained three bundles.  each bundle contained ten bags of what rodriguez believed to be heroin.  rodriguez also found a small bag of what he believed to be marijuana in the defendant's possession.within earshot of the defendant, rodriguez discussed with another trooper his intention to apply for a warrant to search the defendant's home.  upon their arrival at the state police barracks, the defendant asked to use the telephone to arrange transportation for his daughter.  rodriguez dialed the telephone number provided by the defendant and handed him the telephone.  the defendant said into the receiver, ""they're coming.  they're coming.""  rodriguez immediately ended the telephone call and asked the defendant what he meant.  the defendant responded that he wanted them to get rid of the ""contraband"" in the apartment.at trial, rodriguez, a seven-year veteran of the state police, testified that when he arrested the defendant, his appearancepage 67was not consistent with symptoms exhibited by drug addicts rodriguez had encountered in the past.  without objection, rodriguez testified that people looking for drugs looked like ""zombies.""  he said the defendant was not sweating profusely, did not have bloodshot eyes, did not appear ill or gaunt, and was not skinny or unhealthy looking on the day of his arrest.  rodriguez went on to say that the defendant looked the same at the time of trial as he did when he was arrested.  rodriguez did not find any items on the defendant consistent with personal use of heroin.  he testified that, in his experience, ten bags of heroin were the most he had seen someone have on his person for personal use.kenneth gagnonof the massachusetts state police crime laboratory testified that the bags rodriguez recovered from the defendant were a mixture of heroin, acetaminophen, caffeine, and quinine or quinidine.detective gregg bigda of the springfield police department testified that he had spent eight years in the narcotics bureau and had extensive training and experience in investigating narcotics offenses.  he described the manner in which heroin can be used, including the most common way, through injection.  he described how heroin is prepared for injection, including the use of a spoon, lighter, and cotton balls.  he testified that heavy heroin users consume anywhere from one to more than twenty bags a day, and that they spend most of their day looking for their next bag.  bigda testified that, in his experience, heroin is typically sold in individual bags for personal use at a cost of $10 per bag.  he indicated that heroin can sometimes be cheaper if it is purchased in bulk, and that three bundlescould cost between $180 and $250.bigda also testified that a heroin addict often displays physical symptoms such as weight loss, poor hygiene, and poor dental health.  he indicated these symptoms are not easy to mask, but that some users do not exhibit these symptoms and live relatively productive lives.  he also testified that if someone had thirty bags of heroin without any drug paraphernalia, the person was probably selling narcotics, and that people with bundles of heroin are usually selling, although the vast majority of low-level drug dealers are also users.  in determining whether someone is selling or using heroin, bigda testified that quantity is a significant, butpage 68not the only factor.bigda testified that it is not uncommon to arrest drug dealers without any money on their person, as dealers tend to keep their money and drugs separate to avoid losing both if they are arrested.  he also testified that dealers often carry a small amount of drugs on their person and keep the main quantity of drugs at a separate location to avoid losing their investment if arrested.  lastly, he testified that a drug dealer often carries more than one type of narcotic to sell.at trial, defense counsel conceded that the substance found on the defendant was heroin, but contended that it was for personal use, and not for distribution.he stressed that bigda did not find any money, pagers, or cellular telephones in the defendant's possession.discussion.  1.  negative profiling evidence.  the defendant argues that the admission of bigda and rodriguez's testimony, which, taken together, indicated that the defendant did not match the physical description of a drug user, i.e, so-called ""negative profiling"" evidence, was error.  he relies on the holding of commonwealth v. horne,(2017), in support of his claim.  although horne was decided after this trial, the supreme judicial court held that the type of evidence deemed inadmissible there has long been prohibited.  as horne is not a new rule, it is applicable to this appeal.  compare commonwealth v. libran,, 645 (1989) (retroactive application of new rule).  the commonwealth concedes, as it must, that this evidence was erroneously admitted, but argues that there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice despite the error.while negative profiling evidence is inadmissible and ""inherently prejudicial,"" it is not the sole factor to be considered inpage 69determining whether justice miscarried.  horne, supra at 228.  rather, the error must also ""materially influence[] the guilty verdict,"" commonwealth v. alphas,, 13 (1999) (quotation omitted), and our review of the record must leave us with ""a serious doubt [as to] whether the result of the trial might have been different had the error not been made,"" commonwealth v. azar,, 687 (2002).  in horne, the expert witness testified that crack cocaine users are generally unkempt, thin, have deteriorating physical appearances, and poor dental hygiene.  horne, 476 mass. at 225.  here, while bigda's testimony included this type of evidence, he also provided detailed admissible evidence, which aided the jury on the question of intent to distribute.  see commonwealth v. little,, 769 (2009) (""[a] [n]arcotics investigator[] may testify as [an] expert[] . . . [and] testify that in his opinion the amount of [drugs] possessed by the defendant was not consistent with personal use but was consistent with an intent to distribute"" [quotations omitted]).  bigda highlighted the importance of the quantity of drugs recovered, the deliberate separation of a smaller quantity of drugs from both money and a larger quantity of drugs, and the significance of more than one type of drug being carried by a purported dealer.  he also addressed the unlikelihood that a user would have three bundles of heroin at one time, simply because of the cost.  this evidence was properly admitted as it was outside the common knowledge and experience of lay people and aided the jury in reaching a verdict.  see commonwealth v. miranda,, 793 (2004).unlike horne, where there was scant evidence of intent to distribute, here there was substantial properly admitted evidence of distribution.  indeed, the defendant's own words and deeds established distribution.  after his arrest, he created a ruse about needing to use the telephone to arrange transportation for his daughter.  once the telephone call was placed, the defendant instructed the person on the other end of the telephone to dispose of any additional narcotics and related materials when he said,page 70""they're coming.  they're coming.""  this constitutes strong evidence of consciousness of guilt, something that was also not present in horne.  see commonwealth v. stuckich,, 453 (2008).  compare commonwealth v. montanez,, 306 (1991) (defendant's flight was evidence of consciousness of guilt).  the jury could have also considered the ruse and telephone call as evidence of the defendant's intent to distribute.  see commonwealth v. perez,, 442 (2010) (defendant's attempt to dispose of drugs contributed to evidence of intent to distribute).and, unlike horne, the commonwealth did not emphasize the negative profiling evidence in the closing argument.  the focus was on the properly admitted evidence.contrast horne, 476 mass. at 228 (substantial risk of miscarriage of justice where prosecutor's closing argument began by focusing on defendant's appearance, and continued to emphasize profiling evidence, contrasting it with defendant's size, strength, and appearance).  finally, the judge's instructions to the jury, which they are presumed to follow, included factors that they could use in assessing whether the defendant possessed the heroin with the intent to distribute.  the judge did not include in the list of factors the appearance of the defendant as compared to that of drug users.  see commonwealth v. donahue,, 718 (2000) (jury is presumed to follow judge's instructions).2.  sufficiency of the evidence.  the defendant claims the evidence was insufficient to prove the substance he possessed was heroin.  although this issue was not contested at trial, the commonwealth was required to prove this element, beyond a reasonable doubt.  we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth.  commonwealth v. latimore,, 677 (1979).rodriguez testified that the packets admitted at trial were the ones he confiscated from the defendant.  gagnon testified that the bags admitted at trial were the bags that were tested, and that they contained heroin.  however, the defendant points to an alleged inconsistency between rodriguez's testimony and the physical evidence submitted at trial.  specifically, the defendant asserts that although rodriguez testified that he took thirty blue packets from the defendant, only twenty-eight pink packets were admitted inpage 71evidence at the trial.  this argument fails, as there was no direct testimony that the packets taken from the defendant were blue.  rather, on cross-examination, rodriguez acknowledged that in his police report, he stated the packets were blue.  this testimony was not admissible to prove the truth of the matter.  see commonwealth v. costello,, 377 (1991).  the jury were entitled to resolve any inconsistencies in rodriguez's testimony.  see commonwealth v. daughtry,, 140 n.1 (1994).  furthermore, when resolving issues of sufficiency of the evidence, we resolve all issues of credibility in favor of the commonwealth.  see commonwealth v. walker,, 198-199 (2007).the defendant's challenge is more properly cast as an attack on the authenticity of the evidence and the related chain of custody.  as there was no objection to the authenticity, we review to determine if there was error, and if so, whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. mccoy,, 850 (2010).  there was no error.  the commonwealth must show that the evidence had been in the defendant's possession.  see commonwealth v. drayton,, 48 (1982).  authenticity is determined by a preponderance of the evidence.  commonwealth v. siny van tran,, 546 (2011).  see mass. g. evid. § 901(a) & note (2017).  authenticity can be established by testimony that the item is what its proponent represents it to be, or where circumstances exist that imply the item is what its proponent represents it to be.  commonwealth v. nardi,, 396 (2008).  the commonwealth established the authenticity of the evidence through both methods -- the direct testimony of rodriguez and gagnon's testimony about the bundles' chain of custody.  any discrepancies in the number of packets and their color go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  see commonwealth v. dale,, 191 (2014).  similarly, any weaknesses in the chain of custody go to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  commonwealth v. harris,, 706 (2009).3.  motion for new trial.  the defendant contends that trial counsel failed to notice and exploit discrepancies in the drug evidence, and that this failure constituted ineffective assistance, entitling him to a new trial.  the motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the motion, ruling that the bundles were properly authenticated and admitted at trial; that any flaw or inconsistency in rodriguez's testimony about the bundles was forpage 72the jury to resolve; and that an objection to authenticity would have been futile.in assessing this claim, we must first determine whether counsel's performance fell below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.  if so, we must determine whether better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.  commonwealth v. saferian,, 96 (1974).  we extend special deference to the action of the motion judge who, as here, was also the trial judge.  commonwealth v. leng,, 787 (2012).contrary to the defendant's argument, trial counsel did cross-examine rodriguez on discrepancies between his report and the evidence.  trial counsel ended his recross-examination as follows:q.:  ""so when you're looking at the drugs . . . , can you tell the jury what color you described the packets as?""a.:  ""in my report it's blue.""q.:  ""blue.  thank you.""trial counsel's decision not to attack the chain of custody was a reasonable tactical decision, particularly in view of the strength of the commonwealth's case.  see commonwealth v. lally,, 706 (2016) (counsel's strategic decision on focus of cross-examination was not ""manifestly unreasonable"").  trial counsel focused on the weakness of the commonwealth's case -- intent to distribute -- particularly where the evidence of thirty bags of heroin could be for personal use.  trial counsel was not ineffective for choosing to forgo an argument of insufficient merit.  see breese v. commonwealth,, 256 (1993).judgment affirmed.orders denying motion for new trial and for reconsideration affirmed.",criminal,John A.

1630,commonwealth  vs.  eric moore.,"motor vehicle, unauthorized use.  rules of criminal procedure.  probable cause.  practice, criminal, complaint, dismissal, arraignment.  constitutional law, separation of powers.this court concluded that a judge does not have the authority to dismiss a criminal charge against an adult offender prior to arraignment after the complaint has issued on that charge [75-77], but does have authority to consider the legal adequacy of the criminal charge subsequently, pursuant to a motion to dismiss the complaint. [77-79]","the defendant, eric moore, was charged with, among other things, using a motor vehicle without authority (use without authority), in violation of g. l. c. 90, § 24(2)(a).  at the arraignment hearing, the defendant orally moved to dismiss the charge of use without authority; the judge allowed the defendant's motion prior to arraignment and proceeded to arraign the defendant on the remaining charges.  the commonwealth filed this timely appeal, arguing that the judge erred in dismissing the use without authority charge for two reasons:  first, a complaint against an adult defendant, unlike one against a juvenile, cannot be dismissed prior to arraignment; and second, the complaint was supported by probable cause that the defendant used the motor vehicle without authority.  for the reasons set forth infra, we reverse the dismissal of the charge of use without authority.background.  on march 23, 2015, the defendant was driving a rental car and was pulled over for failing to come to a complete stop at a stop sign.  when the police officers asked the defendantpage 74for his license and registration, the defendant responded that he did not have a license in his possession.  upon a criminal justice information system query, the officers learned that the defendant's out-of-state license was suspended.  the officers then contacted the rental company and obtained a copy of the rental agreement for the vehicle, which provided that nicole hosier of pittsfield was the only individual authorized to operate the rental car.  the officers subsequently arrested the defendant for, among other things, use without authority, and towed the rental car.at the defendant's arraignment hearing, defense counsel requested to be heard prior to the arraignment.  defense counsel asked the judge to dismiss the use without authority charge because the facts do ""not constitute . . . use without authority.""  the judge agreed, stating:""[w]here there's a rental company, there's a lessee for that car.  if somebody else is driving, i understand the civil issue between the rental company and whoever was driving, and maybe there's a civil issue with the person who actually rented the car, but under the criminal statute, where you're charging the person with use without authority simply based on the fact that the person who's driving, his name is not on the lease agreement, i don't believe that that's what the statute was intended for.""the judge dismissed the use without authority charge prior to arraigning the defendant on that charge.  the commonwealth filed the instant appeal.  however, due to the pending release of the supreme judicial court decision in commonwealth v. campbell,(2016), the appellate proceedings for this case were stayed.  we now address the commonwealth's appeal.discussion.  this case requires us to decide whether a judge can allow an adult defendant's motion to dismiss a criminal charge prior to arraignment on that charge, after a clerk-magistrate's finding of probable cause.  initially, this question involves an analysis and an application of the massachusetts rules of criminal procedure and the relevant case law, but ultimately it also requires an analysis of a judge's authority pursuant to art. 30 of the massachusetts declaration of rights.these analyses arepage 75separate but related, and a judge's authority in this area is ultimately determined by the requirements of art. 30.1.  massachusetts rules of criminal procedure.  ""in interpreting a rule of criminal procedure, we turn first to the rule's plain language.""  commonwealth v. denehy,, 733 (2014).  the supreme judicial court, in this instance, has provided us with a detailed blueprint of a party's motion practice and the procedural stages in which such practice is to take place.  rule 11(a), as appearing in  442 mass. 1509  (2004), states that ""arraignment . . . the court shall order the prosecuting attorney and defense counsel to attend ato consider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious disposition of the case"" (emphases supplied).  rule 11(b)(2)(ii), as appearing in  442 mass. 1509  (2004), states that such matters shall include ""allpending at the time of the pretrial hearing,"" and that all ""[o]ther pending pretrial motions,"" namely, such as a motion to dismiss, ""may be heard"" (emphases supplied).  similarly, rule 13, as appearing in  442 mass. 1516  (2004), provides that ""[a]filed prior to the pretrial hearing may be heard"" (emphases supplied).  while neither rule 11 nor rule 13 affirmatively ""prohibits a motion to dismiss from being filed or ruled upon before arraignment,"" commonwealth v. humberto h.,, 574 (2013), neither rule affirmatively provides a judge with the authority to rule on such motions brought by an adult defendant before arraignment.  rather, the rules of criminal procedure provide a motion practice that is implemented after arraignment and specifically provide that a judge may rule on such motions either at the pretrial hearing, at a hearing scheduled to address the motion, or at the trial session, all of which naturally occur after the defendant has been arraigned on the charge(s).  cf. commonwealth v. newton n.,, 752-753 (2018); commonwealth v. orbin o.,, 762-763 (2018).dismissing an adult defendant's charge prior to arraignment not only would exceed the judge's authority provided by thepage 76rules, but also would run contrary to our case law.  in commonwealth v. dibennadetto,, 313 (2002), the supreme judicial court held:""[t]he issuance of a complaint by a clerk-magistrate is not to be revisited by a further show cause hearing; the defendant's remedy is a motion to dismiss the complaint. . . .  [a] motion to dismiss . . . is the appropriate and only way to challenge a finding of probable cause.  after the issuance of a complaint, a motion to dismiss will lie for a failure to present sufficient evidence to the clerk-magistrate (or judge) . . . for a violation of the integrity of the proceeding . . . or for any other challenge to the validity of the complaint."",as previously stated, such nondiscovery motion practice occurs after arraignment.moreover, the supreme judicial court holding in humberto h., which provides juvenile court judges with the broad discretion to dismiss a complaint against a juvenile defendant prior to arraignment, does not apply to adult offenders.  the court in humberto h. held that a judge does not abuse his or her discretion in deciding to hear and to rule on a juvenile's motion to dismiss before arraignment where the judge reviews the complaint application and ""concludes that there is a substantial likelihood that the motion is meritorious.""  466 mass. at 575.  see commonwealth v. newton n., supra; commonwealth v. orbin o., supra.  in reaching this conclusion, the court reasoned that because the ""juvenile justice system 'is primarily rehabilitative,, and geared toward ""the correction and redemption to society of delinquent children,""'"" juvenile court judges must have the ""broad discretion to protect the best interests of children consistent with the interests of justice,"" which includes the discretion to dismiss charges before arraignment, if no probable cause exists, to prevent the creation of a juvenile's court activity record information (cari) (emphasis supplied).  commonwealth v. humberto h.,page 77supra at 576 (citation omitted).  this analysis does not likewise extend to adult offenders.here, unlike in humberto h., the defendant has failed to provide us with any policy reason or statutory authority that would cause us to apply the rules of criminal procedure in a way that would allow a judge to dismiss a criminal charge against an adult offender prior to arraignment.  see id. at 575-576 (applying [1] goal of preventing creation of juvenile's cari, [2] primary goal of juvenile justice system, which is to rehabilitate juveniles, and [3] g. l. c. 119, § 53, which mandates that juveniles ""as far as practicable . . . shall be treated, not as criminals, but as children in need of aid, encouragement and guidance,"" to application of rules of criminal procedure, specifically dismissal of criminal charge prior to arraignment for lack of probable cause).a judge, therefore, cannot dismiss an adult criminal complaint prior to arraignment, after a clerk-magistrate has determined that sufficient probable cause (legal basis) existed to issue the complaint.  this limitation is based in our case law and our rules of criminal procedure and is focused exclusively on a judge's authority prior to the arraignment stage, subsequent to the issuance of a criminal complaint.  see bradford v. knights,, 752-753 (1998); commonwealth v. dibennadetto, 436 mass. at 312-313.  we must consider, finally, whether a judge has the authority, in consideration of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine as contained in art. 30, to dismiss a criminal complaint after it has issued and after the defendant has been arraigned on the charge.2.  article 30.  ""in the context of criminal prosecutions, the executive power affords prosecutors wide discretion in deciding whether to prosecute a particular defendant, and that discretion is exclusive to them. . . .  'judicial review of decisions which are within the executive discretion of the [prosecutor] ""would constitute an intolerable interference by the judiciary in the executive department of the government and would be in violation of art. 30 of the declaration of rights.""'""  commonwealth v. cheney,, 574 (2003) (citation omitted).a judge may determine, under our separation of powers, only whether a sufficient legal basis exists for issuance of a criminal complaint.  ""[w]hen a judge, '[w]ithout any legal basis . . . preempt[s] the commonwealth's presentation of its case [t]hat action effectively usurp[s] the decision-making authority constitutionallypage 78allocated to the executive branch.'""ibid. (citation omitted).  see commonwealth v. hart,, 8 (1889) (""only an attorney authorized by the commonwealth to represent it has authority to declare that he will not further prosecute a case in behalf of the commonwealth.  a court is not a prosecuting officer, and does not act as the attorney for the commonwealth.  its office is judicial, -- to hear and determine between the commonwealth and the defendant"").the federal courts have determined that the existence of probable cause is necessary for a criminal charge to be legally adequate.the existence of probable cause is also necessary for a criminal charge to be legally adequate within this commonwealth.  see generally commonwealth v. dibennadetto, 436 mass. at 312; commonwealth v. clerk-magistrate of the w. roxbury div. of the dist. ct. dept.,, 354-356 (2003); commonwealth v. humberto h., 466 mass. at 564-566.  the rules of criminal procedure and our case law have defined the procedural requirements of a judicial determination of the legal adequacy of a criminal complaint.  this judicial determination is the appropriate and necessary exercise of the judicial function contained in art. 30.thus, procedurally, once the complaint has been issued by the clerk-magistrate, the question of its legal adequacy cannot be reconsidered until after arraignment of the defendant on thepage 79criminal charge.  reconsideration of the legal adequacy of the issued complaint may be conducted pursuant to a motion to dismiss after arraignment.  the commonwealth's prosecutorial rights protected by art. 30 are implicated on the determination of legal adequacy whether initially by the clerk-magistrate or subsequently by a judge pursuant to consideration of a motion to dismiss.conclusion.  we conclude that a judge does not have the authority to dismiss a criminal charge against an adult offender prior to arraignment after the complaint has issued on that charge, but does have authority to consider the legal adequacy of the criminal charge subsequently, pursuant to a motion to dismiss the complaint.thus, here, the order dismissing the charge of use without authority is reversed.  the commonwealth may move for arraignment of the defendant on this charge if it so chooses.so ordered.",criminal,Myong J.

""[t]he proper focus of [the] ex post facto inquiry is whether the relevant change 'alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty bypage 86which a crime is punishable.""  dominique v. weld, 73 f.3d at 1162, quoting from california dept. of corrections v. morales, 514 u.s. 499, 506 n.3 (1995).  the prohibition against ex post facto laws necessarily relates to punishment, and not ""remedial"" policies, such as pes.  see lyman v. commissioner of correction,, 207 (1999).  see also opinion of the justices to the senate,, 1220 (1996) (""[l]aws[ that] rearrange rights so as to effect what is believed to be the public good[] are described compendiously as regulatory or remedial"").  the stated goal of the pes program was to promote public safety by incentivizing program compliance, not to punish those who do not comply.  pes consequences merely constitute a change in butler's conditions, and do not ""inflict a greater punishment than the law imposed for the same crime.""lyman v. commissioner of correction, supra at 206, citing dominique v. weld, supra at 1162.4.  double jeopardy.  to the extent that butler alleges the pes policy violates his right against double jeopardy, the claim is without merit.  ""the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution protects against a second prosecution for the same offense, either after acquittal or after conviction, and multiple punishments for the same offense.""  lyman v. commissioner of correction, supra at 207.  see opinion of the justices to the senate, 423 mass. at 1221-1222.  butler's circumstances fit none of these categories.  he was not tried a second time for his offenses, and he did not receive multiple punishments for the same offenses.  once convicted and sentenced as a sex offender, butler was recommended to participate in sotp to decrease the likelihood that he would recidivate.  when he elected not to participate, certain privileges were rescinded as a result.  this was not additional punishment for his crimes.  seepage 87lachance v. commissioner of correction, 88 mass. app. ct. at 512-513.  indeed, encouraging program participation by withholding incentives from inmates who elect not to participate in sex offender rehabilitation programs does not increase the penalty for their crimes or extend the length of their overall sentence.see dominique v. weld, 73 f.3d at 1162, citing california dept. of corrections v. morales, 514 u.s. at 506 n.3.  see also 103 department of correction regulations (doc) § 400 (2014) ""program access.""5.  eighth amendment.  butler also claims that reassigning him from a single room to a double, without any screening for compatibility (presumably with his new cellmate), violated the eighth amendment to the united states constitution and art. 26 of the massachusetts declaration of rights, which prohibit cruel and unusual punishments.  we disagree.to prove a violation of the eighth amendment, butler must satisfy a demanding standard.  ""because routine discomfort is part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society, only those deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an eighth amendment violation.""  hudson v. mcmillian, 503 u.s. 1, 9 (1992) (citation and quotation omitted).  to prove a ""conditions of confinement"" claim under the eighth amendment, butler must show (1) conditions ""sufficiently serious"" as to ""result in the denial of the 'minimal civilized measure of life's necessities,'"" farmer v. brennan, 511 u.s. 825, 832, 834 (1994), quoting from rhodes v. chapman, 452 u.s. 337, 347 (1981), and (2) that the department acted with ""deliberate indifference"" to his health or safety.farmer v. brennan, supra at 834.page 88""no static 'test' can exist by which courts determine whether conditions of confinement are cruel and unusual.""  rhodes v. chapman, supra at 346.  courts interpreting the eighth amendment and art. 26 of our declaration of rights take a flexible approach, deriving their ""'meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society[,]' . . . as measured by objective standards.""  michaud v. sheriff of essex county,, 527-528 (1983), quoting from libby v. commissioner of correction,, 431 (1982).  see good v. commissioner of correction,, 335 (1994).  one such objective standard can be found in state legislation and regulations governing the department and its treatment of inmates.  michaud v. sheriff of essex county, supra at 529-531.with respect to butler's claim, 103 doc § 400.08 (2014) addresses inmate housing cell assignments, including the use of double occupancy cells and rooms.  this regulation permits double occupancy ""where single cells are not . . . appropriate"" and requires the department to consider a series of guidelines, which prioritize inmate safety, when authorizing such assignments.in fact, from our reading of the regulation, double occupancy appears to be the norm, with single occupancy reserved for inmates who are more vulnerable or who are likely to present a risk of harm to others.  measured by this objective standard, reassigning inmates to double occupancy cells is acceptable.  however, it is important to note that even if the guidelines or regulations were violated, or if they ceased to exist, such a circumstance would not itself constitute a ""per se"" eighth amendment or art. 26 violation given the flexibility of the standard to be applied.  see michaud v. sheriff of essex county, 390 mass. at 531.page 89here, pursuant to the pes, butler lost the privilege of living in a single cell due to his choice not to participate in the sotp.  these facts neither demonstrate nor allow an inference that butler has been denied ""the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities.""  rhodes v. chapman, 452 u.s. at 347.  nor can we infer from his complaint that he faces any danger in his double cell assignment.simply put, ""the constitution does not mandate comfortable prisons.""  id. at 349.  see wilson v. seiter, 501 u.s. 294, 298 (1991).  at bottom, as the united states supreme court has held, requiring a prisoner to share his cell with another inmate or multiple other inmates does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.  rhodes v. chapman, 452 u.s. at 349-352.various other arguments the plaintiffs presented on appeal failed to cite to relevant legal authority or to their basis in the record and, as such, do not rise to the level of appellate argument.  see mass.r.a.p. 16(a)(4), as amended,  367 mass. 921  (1975).  they are therefore deemed to be waived.  see popp v. popp,, 1023 n.1 (2017).judgments affirmed.",civil,Paul D.

[92-94]","the plaintiff, arthur cournoyer, appeals from a superior court judgment dismissing his claims for declaratory judgment and specific performance against the defendants.  the plaintiff argues that the department of state police (department) is required by g. l. c. 22c, § 24a, to develop individualized training programs for former state police troopers seeking reinstatement, rather than require them to complete recruit training at the state police academy (academy).  concluding that the statute is unambiguous and that the department may require former troopers separated for more than three years to complete recruit training, we affirm, ordering that the judgment be modified to declare the rights of the parties.1.  standard of review.  we review a ruling on a motion to dismiss de novo, rodriguez v. massachusetts bay transp. authy.,page 91, 28 (2017), taking the complaint's allegations as true, as well all reasonable inferences drawn in the plaintiff's favor, saliba v. worcester,, 412 (2017).  to survive a motion to dismiss, the plaintiff must present factual allegations that rise above the level of speculation, iannacchino v. ford motor co.,, 636 (2008), and plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief, flagg v. alimed, inc.,, 26 (2013).2.  background.  the plaintiff was a state police trooper from 1992 until 2000.while so employed, the plaintiff received positive performance evaluations, and he completed all required in-service training in addition to numerous programs, certifications, and service in specialized areas of law enforcement.  in 1998, however, the plaintiff suffered a severe injury while on duty, requiring medical leave and ultimately causing his involuntary retirement in 2000.  following several operations and physical rehabilitation, the plaintiff was able to obtain employment, working for the worcester county sheriff's department and obtaining a private investigator's license.in 2013, the plaintiff learned of the possibility of reinstatement as a state police trooper following involuntary retirement and applied to the public employee retirement administration commission (perac) seeking to return to active status.  after a panel of medical doctors determined that the plaintiff was medically fit to perform the essential duties of a state trooper, perac approved the plaintiff's application.after completing qualifying physical fitness and agility tests, the plaintiff enrolled in the first available recruit training program at the academy in october, 2015.  recruit training is similar to a military ""boot camp,"" and involves activities designed to, among other things, inculcate recruits with a proper respect for the chain of command.  the plaintiff was the only former state trooper enrolled at that time.  the plaintiff was approximately fifty-eight years old; the recruits were younger than thirty-five years old when they applied to take the state trooper competitive examination.  see g. l. c. 22c, § 10.once there, the plaintiff was subjected to what he described as ""hazing"" by the drill instructors, such as being yelled at forpage 92""eyeballing"" a drill instructor, being required to chant while holding a tray of food, and being required to eat and stop eating when directed.  on the first day, he met with the academy's commanders and expressed his belief that recruit training was inappropriate for an experienced former trooper with his qualifications.  the commanders, while expressing sympathy, advised him that the program was a mandatory prerequisite to reinstatement.  the plaintiff promptly departed the academy and thereby failed to complete the required training.  nonetheless, he refused to tender his resignation and maintained that he was entitled to reinstatement through completion of individualized in-service training.the plaintiff filed a complaint in superior court requesting declaratory judgment and specific performance, essentially to require his reinstatement upon the completion of refresher training.  a superior court judge dismissed his complaint under mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6),  365 mass. 754  (1974), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.3.  discussion.  ""in interpreting the meaning of a statute, we look first to the plain statutory language.  'where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it is conclusive as to legislative intent,'"" worcester v. college hill properties, llc,, 138 (2013), quoting from martha's vineyard land bank commn. v. assessors of w. tisbury,, 27 (2004), which it is our primary duty to effectuate.  malloch v. hanover,, 788 (2015).  accordingly, where the statutory language is clear, its plain meaning should be applied ""unless to do so would achieve an illogical result.""  sullivan v. brookline,, 360 (2001).the controlling statute, g. l. c. 22c, § 24a, is not ambiguous.  subsection (a), inserted by st. 2000, c. 159, § 52,provides that any member seeking reinstatement after more than one year of disability retirement must pass background, medical, and physical fitness tests, ""and complete retraining as determined by the colonel.""  subsection (d) states that ""[a]ny member, retired for disabilityshall not return to active service for the department if such member fails to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (a) and"" (emphases supplied).  by its plain language, the statute grants the colonel discretion to require different retraining requirements for reinstatementpage 93depending on the length of the disability retirement.  see commonwealth v. williamson,, 682 (2012), quoting from ginther v. commissioner of ins.,, 324 (1998) (""where the legislature used different language in different paragraphs of the same statute, it intended different meanings"").  no interpretation is required, as the plain language is conclusive as to the legislative intent.the training prescribed by the colonel and applied by the department in this case is within the broad discretion afforded the colonel by § 24a.  under general order adm-11e, a trooper seeking reinstatement after a separation of more than one year but fewer than three years must be evaluated by a commander ""regarding any additional training required.""  by contrast, the colonel requires former troopers seeking reinstatement after more than three years' separation from service to complete recruit training.  recruit training is conducted at the academy by academy personnel.  accordingly, recruit training is ""state police academy training as required by the colonel"" within the meaning of § 24a(d).  see sullivan, 435 mass. at 360 (""the language is not susceptible of a different reading"").  furthermore, this recruit training is consistent with the broad authority conferred to the colonel to direct state police training under g. l. c. 22c, § 10.the plaintiff requests that the colonel be required to provide him ""with refresher training in skilled driving, firearm recertification, latest developments in law enforcement, criminal law, motor vehicle law, evidence, identification, ethics, court procedures, diversity awareness, community policing and other reasonable and appropriate course subject matter.""  this invitation for court management of the state police training, however, is inconsistent with the legislature's decision to vest discretion in the colonel to decide the proper scope of retraining.  interpreting § 24a(d) to require this sort of training, rather than ""state police academy training as required by the colonel,"" ""would require that we 'read into [the] statute a provision which the legislature did not see fit to put there, [and to] add words that the legislature had an option to, but chose not to include.'""  malloch, 472 mass. at 790, quoting from massachusetts insurers insolvency fund v. smith,, 567 (2010).page 94instead, we apply the statutory mandate of § 24a(d) and defer to the discretion exercised by the colonel.  in this regard, we recognize that individualized retraining programs for long-retired former troopers could impose unnecessary costs to the department with haphazard results.  accord sullivan, 435 mass. at 362 (""required retraining ensures that former retirees are fully prepared to perform the duties imposed by their positions, reducing the risk of reinjury and liability to third parties"").  rather, ""the statutory language means precisely what it says,"" malloch, 472 mass. at 789, and the plaintiff's failure to complete recruit training as expressly required ""is fatal to [his] claim,"" facella v. newton,, 464 (2007) (former city police officer properly denied reinstatement for failure to complete retraining program required by analogous statute).4.  conclusion.  although there was no error in the allowance of the motion to dismiss the complaint, the judge was required to declare the rights of the parties.  see snell v. department of correction,, 1022 (2011).  the judgment shall therefore be modified to declare that the colonel has the discretion to require the plaintiff to complete recruit training prior to reinstatement.  as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.so ordered.",civil,Bruce R.

[100-103]","we are called upon in this interlocutory appeal to decide whether a superior court judge erred in allowing the defendant's motion to suppress statements he made during a police interview.  the defendant's native and primary language is moldovan but he also has some knowledge of russian, apage 96language unrelated to moldovan.  to bridge the language barrier between the officers (who spoke english) and the defendant (who did not) the officers enlisted the help of a russian-speaking student intern (intern).  the intern had no knowledge of moldovan, and was not a certified interpreter in russian.  after reviewing a videotape of the interview and conducting an evidentiary hearing that included testimony from a court-certified russian interpreter, the judge found numerous irregularities in the way the intern carried out his interpretative role.  these included instances where the intern omitted or changed words, phrases, and even questions and answers; instances where the intern suggested words to the defendant that the defendant adopted to his detriment; instances where the intern asked his own questions; and instances where the intern resorted to pantomime and gestures in an attempt to explain russian words to the defendant and to help understand what the defendant was trying to say.  the judge concluded that the defendant was not effectively advised of his miranda rights and that the defendant's statement was not voluntary because much of the statement was not his.in this interlocutory appeal, the commonwealth argues that (1) the defendant was not in custody, (2) as a result, miranda warnings were not required, (3) in any event, the defendant's waiver of those rights was voluntary, and (4) the defendant's statement was voluntary.  like the judge, we conclude that the commonwealth did not meet its burden of establishing voluntariness, and we affirm the order.  deciding as we do, we do not reach the commonwealth's other arguments.background.the defendant's motion to suppress was accompanied by an affidavit from counsel, who averred that he had communicated in person with his client using russian interpreters.  each of the two interpreters had told him that the defendant was not fluent in russian and had trouble expressing his thoughts in russian.  counsel further averred that one of the interpreters had listened to the police interview of the defendant and was ofpage 97the view that the intern's translation from english to russian (and vice versa) was faulty.  counsel suggested that a moldovan interpreter was necessary for a proper waiver of the defendant's miranda rights and in order to communicate meaningfully with the defendant.over the course of two days, the judge conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress.  three witnesses testified:  west springfield police detective matthew mattina, the intern, and roman jakub, a court-certified interpreter for russian and ukrainian.  in addition to having the benefit of the testimony of these witnesses, the judge had the videotape of the interview, as well as a transcription of the interview containing a certified translation of the interview (certified translation).  the judge made her detailed findings based on her assessment of the witnesses' testimony, the videotaped interview, and the certified translation.  we note that, although the commonwealth challenges the judge's ultimate conclusions, it does not contend that any of the judge's subsidiary findings are clearly erroneous.  with that background in mind, we turn to the judge's findings, which are wholly confirmed by our independent review of the videotaped interview and the certified translation, as well as by the transcript of the evidentiary hearing.the defendant is from moldova, and his native language is moldovan, a romance language.  he came to the united states three years before the events at issue in this case and has acquired an extremely limited understanding of english.  he cannot effectively express himself in english, nor is there any indication that he can read or write english.moldova was part of the soviet union until 1991 and russian (a slavic language unrelated to moldovan) was the official language during that time.  after moldova declared independence from the soviet union, romanian became its official language.  the defendant (who was born in 1985) was a young child when the soviet union dissolved.  however, he acquired some knowledge of russian as a secondary language in the sense that he can understand and speak it to a degree.there is nothing to show that the defendant can read or write russian.page 98on the date at issue in this case, march 27, 2013, the defendant worked as a housekeeper in a nursing home in west springfield.  police responded to a report that he may have touched a patient inappropriately.detective mattina spoke to the defendant and immediately could tell that english was not his native language.  the detective told the defendant that he wanted to speak with him at the police station.  the defendant agreed and drove to the west springfield station in his own automobile.there is a large russian-speaking population in west springfield, and the police department routinely asks civilians to serve as interpreters.  on that day, police enlisted the help of the intern, a twenty-five year old college student who was interning with the police department.  the intern, whose first language was russian, was a native of kazakhstan and had moved to the united states when he was eleven years old.  he began interpreting for the police at some point in 2007, while he was still in high school, after his wrestling coach, a west springfield police officer, asked him to.detective mattina and another detective interviewed the defendant for two hours at the police station with the intern acting as interpreter.  the defendant was not handcuffed and the interview was conducted in conversational tones.  the interview began with some basic preliminary questions, such as the defendant's name, date of birth, and type of work, which the defendant was able to answer in english.  during the remainder of the interview the defendant did not speak english (with the exception of an occasional isolated word).  the detectives spoke english, and the intern spoke english and russian.the detectives did not tell the defendant why he was at the station for questioning.  but detective mattina did say that ""we need to give you your rights"" and then read the miranda warnings in english from a printed card.  the judge found:""there were two sets of warnings available, one typed in english and one typed copy in russian.  [the intern] showed the defendant the warnings and asked him to sign the forms.  [the intern] did not read the warnings to the defendant, yet the defendant claimed he understood the writings and signed both documents.  in reviewing the recording, however, i find it clear that not only did [the intern] fail to actually read the documents to the defendant in russian, there is no indicationpage 99from the recording that the defendant actually read the warnings from the russian document.  further, [the intern] merely interpreted the warnings the police provided, and jakub credibly testified that the warnings were not read, word for word, in russian to the defendant.""no one asked the defendant what his primary language was, nor was any effort made to determine if he could read russian.the judge found (and our review of the videotaped interview and the certified translation leads us to agree) that the interview was ""truncated"" in the sense that the various participants were often talking over each other, at cross purposes, or without understanding what the other was saying.  the interview can fairly be characterized as consisting largely of confusion, with each participant often unable to understand what the others were saying.  much of this appears to be language driven because the defendant and the intern do not appear to have shared a mutual facility in a common language.  but, in addition, there were numerous instances where the intern (1) mistranslated what the detectives asked or said, (2) asked an entirely different question from that posed by the detectives, (3) asked his own questions, (3) mistranslated the defendant's answers, (4) did not translate the defendant's answer at all, (5) added something the defendant did not say, (6) suggested words or answers to the defendant when the defendant apparently could not understand or find the words to express himself, and (7) himself answered the detectives' questions (without any statement having been made by the defendant).these irregularities were not only limited to ancillary matters, but also occurred during questioning about the central issue under investigation:  whether the defendant had inappropriately touched the patient.  in addition, there were moments of complete failure in communication, with the intern having to resort to gestures and pantomime in order to attempt to bridge the language barrier.  the judge found that ""[t]he mostpage 100appalling aspect of the translated transcript is the number of instances where [the intern] led the defendant into making incriminatory statements.""she also found that ""[t]he recorded interview and transcript are replete with instances where [the intern] created statements attributed to the defendant"" and, thus, that ""much of the statement was not his.""discussion.  in reviewing the judge's allowance of the defendant's motion to suppress, we ""accept[] the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, give[] substantial deference to the judge's ultimate findings and conclusions of law, but independently review[] the correctness of the judge's application of constitutional principles to the facts found.""  commonwealth v. magee,, 384 (1996), quoting from commonwealth v. mello,, 381 n.8 (1995).  the constitutional principle at issue here is the due process requirement that an accused's statements in response to police questioning be voluntary.""a statement is voluntary if it is the expression of a 'rational intellect' in its formulation and a 'free will' in its expression.""  commonwealth v. miller,, 842 (2007), quoting from commonwealth v. davis,, 581 (1988).  in making this determination, ""we examine whether, in light of thepage 101totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, the will of the defendant was overborne to the extent that the statement was not the result of a free and voluntary act.""  commonwealth v. selby,, 663 (1995).  to be considered are ""the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation,"" commonwealth v. tavares,, 146 (1982), quoting from commonwealth v. daniels,, 606 (1975), including (but not limited to) ""'promises or other inducements, conduct of the defendant, the defendant's age, education, intelligence and emotional stability, experience with and in the criminal justice system, physical and mental condition, the initiator of the discussion of a deal or leniency (whether the defendant or the police), and the details of the interrogation, including the recitation of miranda warnings.'""  magee, supra at 388, quoting from selby, supra.

""police must recite miranda warnings in a language, and in a manner, [that] an unlettered and unlearned defendant can understand.""  commonwealth v. siny van tran,, 558 (2011).  see commonwealth v. vuthy seng,, 544 (2002).in addition, as the judge found and our review confirms, there were many times when the defendant and the intern had difficulty communicating and others when they resorted to gestures and pantomime to overcome the absence of a lingua franca.  contrast siny van tran, supra at 559 (defendant's understanding of interpreter demonstrated by his ""cogent, lucid, and[] . . . logically calculated [verbal] responses"").  although the parties may disagree on the extent of the defendant's facility with the russian language, there is no serious dispute that he was not fluent and that he struggled with russian vocabulary during the interview.  the judge credited the testimony of jakub, a court-certified interpreter, that the defendant often did not understand even basic everyday words in russian, let alone legal terms.  by way of example, jakub testified that the defendant did not know the russian verb to ""brush,"" a term that was central to the investigation and one the intern led the defendant to adopt.the intern's interpretation was irregular and unreliable.  he often mistranslated questions and answers, supplied questions and answers of his own, led the defendant into making incriminating statements, and suggested words to the defendant to the defendant's detriment.see commonwealth v. ardon,, 500 (1998) (""defendant also has the opportunity to discredit the translation or credibility of the interpreter in order to demonstrate the lack of a voluntary and intelligent waiver"").  although the police are not required to use certified or independent interpreterspage 103when questioning suspects, id. at 499-500, ""it should go without saying that the interpreter should be competent.""  sim, supra at 224 (brown, j., concurring).  here, there appear to have been no procedural safeguards designed to ensure the methods, accuracy, or reliability of the russian-speaking intern acting as an interpreter for a moldovan-native speaker.for all of these reasons, we see no error in the judge's conclusion that the commonwealth did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's statement was voluntary.  the interview was not conducted in the defendant's primary language.  it was conducted in a language with which he had limited facility, through an untrained interpreter who did not confine himself to the task of accurately translating what the officers or the defendant said.  the judge was on entirely solid ground when she concluded that, in these circumstances, the defendant's statements were not ""his.""  as such they were neither an expression of his rational intellect or free will, nor were they reliable or competent evidence.order allowing motion to  suppress affirmed.",criminal,Tina S.

conviction of armed robbery while masked, this court, construing case law regarding the sufficiency of fingerprint evidence found on a moveable object at a crime scene, concluded that where the presence of the defendant's deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) on moveable objects found at the scene of the crime (i.e., a t-shirt and bandana) did not provide sufficient information to determine when the dna was deposited on the objects, such dna evidence alone [107-109], or in combination with other attenuated evidence presented by the commonwealth [109-111], was insufficient to sustain the defendant's conviction.","following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of armed robbery while masked, pursuant to g. l. c. 265, § 17, and assault by means of a dangerous weapon, pursuant to g. l. c. 265, § 15b(b). on appeal, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction under commonwealth v. morris,(1996).  applying the supreme judicial court's jurisprudence regarding the sufficiency of fingerprint evidence found on a moveable object at a crime scene to the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) evidence in this case, we agree.background.  on july 3, 2013, two men broke into a burger king in easton at around 11:30 p.m. and stole approximately $3,000.page 105both men were described by the restaurant manager, who was present during the robbery, as african-american and wearing blue surgical masks.  the first assailant was approximately six feet tall, and armed with a gun; he wore a dark hooded sweatshirt.  the second assailant, who wore a tan hooded sweatshirt, was ""a little bit taller"" than the armed man.surveillance recordings from the burger king and the neighboring dunkin' donuts captured images of both men as they fled the crime scene.  the recordings showed the second assailant removing his mask and, as he is fleeing the crime scene, tossing something into the dunkin' donuts plaza.  his profile was captured in one of the recordings; however, the recording (and the still photographs captured from it) were grainy and of extremely poor quality.the surveillance recordings also captured a white vehicle matching the make and model of the defendant's mother's vehicle.one of the police officers who responded to the crime scene discovered two cloth items -- a white toddler-sized t-shirt and a blue knotted bandana -- in the dunkin' donuts plaza.  the commonwealth's theory was that the defendant was the second assailant.  based on the recordings,the commonwealth argued that the second assailant threw the cloth items into the dunkin' donuts plaza as he passed it and that he wore the t-shirt as a mask during the robbery, while his coventurer wore the bandana.the t-shirt and the bandana were tested for dna.  first, a criminologist collected two samples from the t-shirt -- one from the interior of the t-shirt and one from the exterior.  she also collected one sample from the bandana.  each of the samples was collected by scraping the material with a scalpel to loosen any skin cells that may have been imbedded in the fibers and then taking a swab.second, a dna analyst tested the samples to determine whether the defendant's dna matched the dna onpage 106the samples.   each sample from the t-shirt had the dna of more than one person; the bandana contained dna from at least three individuals.for the t-shirt samples, the major profile matched the defendant's dna profile.one of the major profiles of the bandana also matched the defendant's dna profile.the dna analyst could not determine when any of the defendant's dna was deposited on either the t-shirt or the bandana.the defense at trial was that the defendant was in quincy at the time of the easton robbery.  three witnesses testified in support of his alibi.  quincy police officer stephen o'donaghue testified that he had seen the defendant, along with his friend, mark cram, at a street festival in quincy sometime between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.  cram similarly testified that he had been with the defendant at the festival until approximately 9:30 p.m., when cram got into a fight and suffered an eye injury.  according to cram, the defendant accompanied him first to his mother's home and then to the hospital, both of which were in quincy.  cram's mother, marie lawson, corroborated that the defendant had brought cram home and had accompanied them to the hospital around 10:45 p.m.cram and lawson testified that the defendant remained alone in lawson's medical transportation van, which had a wheelchair sticker on the back, in an emergency parking spot while cram was treated in the emergency department.  lawson testified that they left the hospital around midnight or 1:00 a.m., and returned to her home where the defendant remained until at least 3:00 a.m.the evidence also showed that the defendant's brother hadpage 107been involved in a robbery in weymouth with a similar modus operandi.  in particular, a couple of months after the easton robbery, the brother was arrested, along with another man,following an armed robbery of a store in weymouth.  as in the easton robbery, both men were armed and masked.  furthermore, the brother, who lived with his mother and had access to and often drove her vehicle, was driving the mother's vehicle just prior to the weymouth robbery.  a search of the trunk of the vehicle revealed several items of clothing, and the brother's driver's license was found in the center console.  following the weymouth robbery, the brother fled to rhode island and was eventually captured.  in addition to comparing the defendant's dna to the dna from the t-shirt and bandana samples from the easton robbery, the dna analyst also compared the brother's dna to these samples.  his dna profile was not a major profile on any of the three samples, but he could not be ruled out as a minor profile on either the t-shirt (because the data were insufficient for testing) or the bandana (because the mixture was too complex).discussion.  1.  application of morris to dna.  on appeal, we must first consider whether the principle articulated in morris and its progeny concerning fingerprint evidence applies to the dna evidence in this case.  in morris, the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and armed assault in a dwelling, based on a fatal shooting by masked intruders.  422 mass. at 254-255.  one intruder wore a clown mask.  id. at 255.  at trial, the commonwealth introduced evidence that the defendant's thumbprint was found on a clown mask that was left by an intruder at the scene of the crime.  id. at 256.  the supreme judicial court reiterated the principle that where ""the only identification evidence is the defendant's fingerprint at the crime scene, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the fingerprint was placed there during the crime.""  id. at 257, citing commonwealth v. lacorte,, 703 (1977) (""[w]hen fingerprints constitute the only identification evidence, most jurisdictions require the prosecution to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the fingerprints in fact were placed at the scene during the commission of the crime"").  thus, although fingerprint evidence is generally admissible and certainly can be powerful evidence in support of the commonwealth's case, for the purposepage 108of establishing the sufficiency of the evidence, we have ""generally recognized that fingerprint evidence found at the scene of a crime must be coupled with evidence of other circumstances tending to reasonably exclude the hypothesis that the print was impressed at a time other than that of the crime.""  commonwealth v. baptista,, 911 (1992), quoting from commonwealth v. clark,, 405-506 (1979).  see commonwealth v. french,, 1024 (2017); commonwealth v. ye,, 393 (2001).this principle applies because the presence of a fingerprint on an object alone provides insufficient data to determine when the fingerprint was placed on the object.  united states v. corso, 439 f.2d 956, 957 (4th cir. 1971) (cited in lacorte, 373 mass. at 703).  see ye, 52 mass. app. ct. at 391-392.  indeed, fingerprints can last for months after placement.  corso, supra.  see french, 476 mass. at 1024, 1025 (noting testimony of fingerprint analyst that ""a fingerprint cannot be dated and can remain on a surface for a long period of time,"" and concluding that ""the fingerprint could have been left at some previous time, unrelated to the break-in"").  see also state v. mayell, 163 conn. 419, 426 (1972) (fingerprints on rearview mirror of abandoned vehicle used during robbery and used by the defendant six hours before the crime was committed in connection with his employment ""does not establish his connection with the crime charged""; cited in lacorte, 373 mass. at 703).according to the testimony in this case, the same is true for dna evidence -- that is, its presence on an object alone does not provide sufficient information to determine when the dna was deposited on the object.  in fact, the testimony of the dna analyst shows that the concerns are even more acute with regard to dna than with regard to fingerprints.  the dna analyst testified that dna may cling to an object for decades after it is deposited.she further testified that, unlike fingerprints, an individual can deposit dna on an object without touching it through a process called ""secondary transfer.""according to the dna analyst's testimony, it was impossible to determine from the laboratorypage 109results when the defendant's dna was deposited on either the t-shirt or the bandana, whether it was the defendant who had most recently handled either object, or indeed (in view of the potential for secondary transfer) whether the defendant had directly handled the t-shirt or the bandana at all.given the evidence that the presence of the defendant's dna, like the presence of a fingerprint, did not provide sufficient information to determine when the dna was deposited on the object, we agree that morris governs this case.the presence of the defendant's dna alone was insufficient to provide the jury with enough evidence to sustain the conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.2.  sufficiency of the evidence.  applying morris, the question then is whether the dna evidence coupled with the other evidence presented by the commonwealth was sufficient to allow a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime.  in conducting our analysis, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth.  commonwealth v. latimore,, 676-677 (1979).  the commonwealth points to three items of evidence tying the defendant to the crime.  first, the commonwealth relies on the evidence that the defendant's dna was the only major profile on the child's t-shirt and the bandana.  second, the commonwealth relies on the surveillance footage showing that the make, model, and year of the car used by the assailants matched the defendant's mother's car.  third, the commonwealth relies on the surveillance footage showing the second assailant and his profile.page 110again, the decision in morris informs our analysis.  there, in addition to the thumbprint on the clown mask, the commonwealth introduced evidence that the defendant matched the general description of one of the intruders, that the defendant's mother owned a vehicle resembling one seen fleeing the scene of the crime, and that the defendant was a known associate of two of the other intruders.  422 mass. at 258.  on appeal, the court found that the evidence of the thumbprint, in combination with the other evidence of identity of the perpetrator, would have allowed a jury to reasonably infer that the defendant was one of the intruders, but that ""[t]he evidence does not, however, warrant such a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt.""  id. at 259.like the clown mask with a fingerprint on it in morris, the t-shirt and the bandana with the defendant's dna are portable objects that suggest that the defendant, at some point, may have touched the objects.alone, however, it does not establish that the defendant was one of the assailants who wore the objects during the crime, and is not enough to support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.  see id. at 257-259.  see also french, 476 mass. at 1024-1025 (evidence that the defendant's fingerprint was found on plexiglass window removed during robbery insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the fingerprint was placed there during the crime where top of window was reachable by any passerby and had been left for several hours overnight on the ground where others could have touched it).  accord commonwealth v. renaud,, 262-263 (2012) (electronic bank transfer card with the defendant's name, which was found at a crime scene and taped together in three pieces, was sufficient to infer that the defendant possessed the card but was insufficient to establish that he possessed it and dropped it during the crime).to tie the defendant to the vehicle used by the assailants, the commonwealth points to the evidence that the vehicle on the surveillance recording was the same make and model as the mother's vehicle, the brother used the mother's vehicle for the weymouth robbery with a similar modus operandi, the brotherpage 111often drove the mother's vehicle, and on at least two occasions the defendant was a passenger while the brother was driving.  such an attenuated connection to a vehicle involved in the robbery is not enough support a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.see morris, 422 mass. at 257-259 (insufficient evidence even though the defendant's mother owned a vehicle resembling one seen leaving the scene).with regard to the second assailant's profile on the surveillance footage, it shows that this assailant was likely a black man, about the same height and build as the first assailant.  however, the profile on the surveillance recording is of such poor quality that it cannot reasonably be used for the fine analysis required to establish that the defendant's profile matches the profile on the recording.  the still images from the surveillance recording are even grainier.  accord commonwealth v. pleas,, 328 (2000) (witness's identification of an individual based on his familiarity with the defendant properly admitted because, inter alia, videotape of crime was ""of poor quality although not 'hopelessly obscure'"").here, taken as a whole, the evidence does not support conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.  see morris, 422 mass. at 257-260.judgments reversed.verdicts set aside.judgments to enter for the defendant.",criminal,Renee Paula

in that a second condition of the license stipulated that no building or other structure be placed on the filled area, i.e., the condition was plainly designed to preserve and ensure continued access to the tidelands [116-117]; and in that the so-called no impairment language of the first condition appeared to paraphrase the language of c. 91, § 17, itself, i.e., the logical import of the language of § 17 appeared to prevent a licensee from cutting off existing rights [117-118].","in this case we examine whether the filling of an area of tidelands pursuant to a g. l. c. 91 license extinguished rights held by upland owners to cross that area to access thepage 113remaining tidelands and the sea.  a superior court judge determined that the filling of certain tidelands extinguished the plaintiffs' rights to access remaining tidelands through the end of a private way to which they were abutters.  we reverse, because the c. 91 license by its terms preserved those rights.1.  background.  a.  the dispute.this case involves rackliffe street, a private way on rocky neck, a peninsula that juts into gloucester harbor.  rackliffe street runs north to south, and it is not disputed that at least prior to 1925, the southern end of rackliffe terminated at the mean high water mark of wonson's cove, in gloucester harbor, such that rackliffe street abutters could walk down rackliffe and access the tidelands from the end of the street.currently, the black-topped rackliffe street does not extend all the way to wonson's cove.  rather, it terminates approximately ten feet short of the high water mark, after which one must pass over a ""grassy strip.""  at the southerly end of this ten-foot grassy strip there is a ramp, which descends into the tidelands and can be used for access.the basic dispute is as follows:  the plaintiffs are rackliffe street abutters whose homes are not at the southerly end of the street but who seek access to the tidelands across the grassy strip and ramp.  the defendants are the most southerly abutters, on opposite sides of rackliffe street where the street ends at wonson's cove.  they seek to prevent such access.  the o'connor defendants live at number 18, on the east side of rackliffe; defendant alsue partners owns number 19, on the west side.by deed and law each defendant owns the fee to the center of rackliffe as it abuts their frontage; each also owns the fee not only to their upland property but also to certain tidelands extending southerly, generally, from their properties.  the defendants' respective fee interests are subject to certain easements in favor of rackliffe street abutters and the public generally, which we will discuss infra.page 114the dispute before us is therefore over whether the plaintiffs have a right to cross the grassy strip that now separates the end of the asphalted road and the current high-tide line.  according to the defendants, the strip is the result of fill that was placed in tidelands beyond the end of rackliffe street pursuant to a c. 91 license granted to their predecessor in title, one margaret e. mehlman, in 1925 (license).  the defendants thus claim exclusive rights in the grassy strip, since it resulted from the filling of tidelands that their predecessor owned.in asserting their right to cross the grassy strip, the plaintiffs advanced several theories over the course of the case.  the only theory that the plaintiffs rely upon in this court, however, is that they have private rights to cross the strip and access the tidelands because they are abutters to rackliffe street.  that issue was resolved against them on cross motions for summary judgment.because our ruling is that the plaintiffs themselves were entitled to summary judgment based upon their private rights as abutters, our factual recitation herein considers the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the defendants.  see augat,page 115inc. v. liberty mut. ins. co.,, 120 (1991).b.  the 1925 license.  prior to 1925, rackliffe street ended at the mean high water mark.  the area that is now the grassy strip is south of where rackliffe street ends, and is historic tidelands that were filled pursuant to the 1925 license.  that license granted rights to ""build a sea wall and fill solid in wonson's cove,"" pursuant to an attached plan.  the plan attached to the license shows fill to be placed in the tidelands southerly of 18 and 19 rackliffe, bounded by a new sea wall.  the license, however, contained at least two other material conditions with respect to any fill:  (1) ""this license is granted upon the express condition that no building or other structure shall be placed upon the filled area between the lines of the way marked 'rackliffe st.' upon said plan, extended southerly to the water""; and (2) ""nothing in this license shall be so construed as to impair the legal rights of any person.""2.  discussion.  this matter can be resolved, as a matter of law, based upon the express conditions of the 1925 c. 91 license.  we begin with some basic principles.  first, an abutter to a private way has an easement to traverse ""the entire length of the way,"" not just to use it as access to the nearest public way.  murphy v. mart realty of brockton, inc.,, 677 (1965).  lane v. zoning bd. of appeals of falmouth,, 437 (2006).  this means that the plaintiffs, as abutters to rackliffe street, held the property right to traverse rackliffe street all the way to its southerly end.  second, under the colonial ordinance of 1641-1647, the abutters had rights as members of the public to use the area of the tidelands between mean high and mean low tide, for purposes of ""fishing, fowling and navigation.""  arno v. commonwealth,, 449 (2010).  the combined effect of these two rights means that at least prior to any fill being placed at the end of rackliffe street, abutters had the right to travel down rackliffe street to its end, to cross from there into the tidelands of wonson's cove, and to bring with them a boat -- e.g., a kayak.the defendants, however, contend that under the 1925 license fill was placed at the end of rackliffe resulting in the grassypage 116strip, and that they have exclusive rights in the grassy strip such that they now can exclude other rackliffe street abutters from crossing it to the tidelands.  in particular, the defendants rely upon rauseo v. commonwealth,(2005), for the proposition that, as the motion judge found, the filling of the tidelands at the end of rackliffe ""ended the public's right to fishing, fowling, and navigation on the filled area and allowed the defendants to completely exclude the public from the filled area.""  see id. at 222-223.the contention that filling the tidelands extinguished the plaintiffs' access rights is wrong, because it ignores the express conditions of the 1925 c. 91 license, and their foundation in c. 91 itself.  use of tidelands for activities such as boating, fishing, and food-gathering has been a critical matter in massachusetts at least since colonial times.  there accordingly has been a great deal of legislation and regulation addressing rights and activities in tidelands, and c. 91 and its implementing regulations have regulated such rights in tidelands since well before 1925.  see generally arno, 457 mass. at 449-451.here the defendants' predecessor was granted a c. 91 license including a right to fill, but subject to express conditions.  the first of these conditions was that the license not be ""construed so as to impair the legal rights of any person.""  we think this language is clear; any fill placed cannot ""impair"" preexisting ""legal rights.""  see sheftel v. lebel,, 179 (1998) (""we are able to begin and end our inquiry . . . by reference to the explicit language of the easement"").  here, prior to the 1925 license, rackliffe street abutters had property rights -- that is, ""legal rights"" -- to access the tidelands through the end of the street.  accordingly, under the 1925 license, any fill placed in tidelands at the end of rackliffe could not and did not cut off those abutter rights, as such would have violated the ""no impairment"" clause.a second license condition reinforces our conclusion that the plaintiffs, as rackliffe street abutters, retained these access rights.  the condition stipulated that ""no building or other structure"" be placed on the filled area southerly of rackliffe street, ""extended . . . to the water.""  we read this clause as making provision for a clear path to cross any fill placed between the end of rackliffe street and the sea; it too is plainly designed to preserve, and to ensure, continued access to the tidelands.nothing in rauseo is to the contrary, or prevents a c. 91 license from imposing such conditions.  rauseo announces an understandablepage 117and common sense general rule -- that the lawful filling of tidal flats may extinguish the public's reserved rights to fish, fowl, and navigate in the filled area.see 65 mass. app. ct. at 222-223.  but rauseo did not address the specifics of any license granted under c. 91, and in particular it did not address license conditions like those at issue, which prevent the licensee from blocking access to remaining tidelands.  it is one thing to say that filling tidal flats ends the public's reserved right to boat or fish on the filled area; it is quite another to say, as the defendants insist, that filling terminates private rights to cross the filled area to access the tidelands that remain.our conclusion is further bolstered by the language of c. 91 itself.  in relevant part, § 17 provides today, as it did at the time the license was granted:""no license or other authority . . . to fill up or enclose any ground . . . shall be construed to interfere with or impair the right of any person affected thereby to equal proportional privileges of approaching low water mark . . . or to impair the legal rights of any person.""g. l. c. 91, § 17 (1921).  the ""no impairment"" language in the 1925 c. 91 license accordingly appears to be a paraphrase of § 17, and to have been inserted to ensure satisfaction of those statutory conditions.  see attorney gen. v. vineyard grove co., 181 mass. 507, 508-509 (1902) (holmes, c.j.) (making note of identical ""no impairment"" language in a license pursuant to a predecessor of c. 91).  the language of § 17 supports our decision here, as its logical import appears to prevent a c. 91 license from cutting off existing rights such as, for example, rights to access tidal flats or the sea beyond.see hewitt v. perry,, 104-105 (1941) (owner of land adjoining ocean had no right by a c. 91 license to interfere with another's easement).in sum, prior to 1925, the plaintiffs' predecessors had the right to access the tidelands at the southerly end of rackliffe street, and that right remains today whether or not fill was placed between rackliffe's southerly end and the current tidelands.  the c. 91 license expressly prevents the impairment of the plaintiffs' rights in this regard.  the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that they have the right to traverse rackliffe street to its southerly end, and to pass from there to the mean high tide mark of wonson's cove and beyond, including use of the ramp.the plaintiffs are also entitled to a suitable injunction, which should preclude the defendants from placing any structures or obstructions in rackliffe street or in the area bounded by the lines of rackliffe street extended southerly to the water, including the grassy strip.the judgment is reversed, except that so much of the judgment as ruled against the o'connor defendants on their counterclaim is affirmed.the case is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.so ordered.page 119",civil,Robert A.

[124-125]a district court judge erred in denying the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress statements that he made to police, where a police officer's conversation with the defendant, in which the officer told the defendant that coming forward would make him very likely to avoid being charged with a felony, amounted to a prohibited assurance that the defendant's cooperation with police would aid his defense or lessen his sentence and, therefore, the commonwealth did not meet its burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he made his statements voluntarily. [125-127]","a group altercation outside a party on martha's vineyard led to a complaint charging the defendant with twopage 121counts of felony assault and battery.he now appeals from two orders of a district court judge denying his motions to suppress (1) evidence of an out-of-court identification made by an assault victim, and (2) statements the defendant made to police after suggestions by an officer that his cooperation would avoid a felony charge.we affirm the order denying suppression of the identification.  however, we agree with the defendant that the commonwealth did not meet its burden to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the defendant's statements were voluntary, and accordingly we reverse the order denying his motion to suppress them.background.  we summarize the motion judge's subsidiary findings of fact, which the defendant does not contest.on june 28, 2014, the victim went to a party in west tisbury before going to a party in oak bluffs.  he had three or four beers that evening and it was ""possible"" he had some cocaine.when the victim arrived at the oak bluffs party he encountered matt brown, whose sister the victim had been dating.  believing brown was going to attack him, the victim struck brown first and was then attacked by several others who cornered him in a parking lot.  the victim was between several cars when he struck brown, and then the defendant struck the victim in the face twice.  the defendant tackled the victim and then sat on his chest while hitting him some more.  while the defendant was hitting the victim, a third member of the group, riley dobel, came over and began ""down-force"" kicking and ""stomping"" the victim in the face and arms.the attackers then ran away and the victim was helped by two others, who drove him to the hospital.the victim had seen the defendant earlier at the party, and extended congratulations to him for his brother's new child.  the victim was also introduced to the defendant's friend dobel, and talked to him about playing golf with dobel's father in a ""men's league at farm neck.""  the victim saw the defendant and dobel at other times during the party up until the attack.page 122the victim knew the defendant as an ""island kid,"" knew his father, knew his older brother, and knew that the defendant lived at his grandmother's house around the corner from the victim's house.  as a result, he saw the defendant often; he also periodically saw pictures of the defendant in the newspapers for his athletic accomplishments.  the victim had seen the defendant, and dobel, more than a ""hundred times"" around town.at around 2:00 a.m., on june 28, 2014, detective james morse of the oak bluffs police department was dispatched to the martha's vineyard hospital to interview the victim, who was hospitalized for treatment following the attack.  the victim had suffered multiple facial fractures on both sides of his head.  detective morse noticed that the victim had a ""fractured orbit"" and seemed ""a little off.""  over the course of an interview lasting three or four minutes, the victim told detective morse that he had been jumped by brown and his friends, one of whom was the defendant's brother marquis rivers, at a party in oak bluffs.after staying at the hospital for a short time, detective morse proceeded to the house in oak bluffs where the altercation had occurred.  he met the defendant at the house, and asked him what happened.  the defendant responded he did not know anything or see anything.approximately fourteen hours later, at 4:00 p.m. on june 28, oak bluffs police officer william johnson reported to the police station for his scheduled shift.  detective morse spoke with officer johnson about his investigation of the assault.  johnson was familiar with a couple of the people allegedly involved, including the defendant, whom johnson knew from growing up on martha's vineyard.  johnson had the defendant's telephone number.  detective morse directed johnson to contact the defendant and ask him to come to the police station for an interview.morse told johnson that another individual may have caused the primary harm to the victim; that based on the state of the investigation, the defendant might be charged with a felony; but that it appeared that if the defendant came to the station and told his side of the story, he would be charged with a much lesser crime, such as misdemeanor simple assault.  morse did not, however, instruct johnson to tell the defendant he would receive a lesser charge if he cooperated.johnson telephoned the defendant shortly after his conversation with morse.  johnson identified himself as an oak bluffs police officer, and advised the twenty-six year old defendant that thepage 123police were interested in him as an involved party in the case and that it was the police understanding that he committed a simple assault.  johnson went on to advise the defendant that if he came forward and gave a detailed account, he would be ""very highly likely to avoid being charged with a felony.""at around 5:45 p.m. on june 28, 2014, about ninety minutes after johnson had called him, the defendant called the oak bluffs police department and spoke to detective morse.  the defendant said he had been involved in the fight with the victim.  he said that he and brown had arrived at the house where the assault occurred.  the victim came out of the house and ""sucker punched"" brown.  when asked why he did not say that earlier, the defendant responded that he had been drunk.  morse told the defendant to come to the station for an interview.at 2:00 p.m. the following afternoon, june 29, the defendant and his father came to the police station and met with morse.  the defendant was given proper miranda warnings and then interviewed.the defendant's father was present during the interview.  the defendant proceeded to give a fuller account of his involvement in the altercation than he gave during the previous night's telephone call to morse.  the interview lasted about twelve minutes.  a little more than halfway through the interview, morse commented to the defendant that ""i can't promise you're not going to get charged with any of these injuries, but if you did nearly what you did [sic], it sounds to me like it could be a defense.  you were just trying to help your friend who got punched.  the problem is . . . how it went from your original story to all this.""seven hours later, at 9:00 p.m. on june 29, the defendant returned to the police station (with no prompting by police in the interim) for another recorded interview, which lasted fewer than ten minutes.  the detective asked the defendant to lead him through the fight previously described; this time, the defendant added that dobel kicked the victim after the defendant called for help.  the defendant explained that he yelled for help when the victim was getting the better of him while wrestling on the ground, after the victim sucker punched brown and the defendant intervened.  morse made no reference to reduced charges duringpage 124the second interview.detective morse summarized the results of his investigation in a police report describing the attack on the victim.detective morse sought a further meeting with the victim in july, but an attorney representing the victim contacted the detective by letter dated july 18, 2014, in which he directed the police not to contact the victim, but invited the detective to call him.  the attorney's office also asked for any police reports on the matter.  the detective responded by mail and furnished the police report as requested.  the report contained no photographs of any of the individuals named as involved in the attack.on september 29, 2016, detective morse again interviewed the victim at the oak bluffs police station.  the victim identified his attackers as being the defendant, brown, and dobel.  the victim told detective morse that he had not identified his attackers at the first interview because ""he was not in a good place, and had been beaten up.""  the victim said the reason he had stated that the defendant's brother marquis had attacked him was because he had ""been in school with [marquis], but he was wrong.  it had been his brother, [the defendant] matt rivers.""at the end of the interview, the detective decided to conduct a photographic (photo) array procedure to identify the attackers.  after uniform pictures were selected of various subjects, the victim was then shown two sequential, double-blind photo arrays of six photographs each.photographs of the defendant and his brother were in one of the arrays.the victim identified the picture of the defendant as that of one of his attackers.identification.  ""where an out-of-court eyewitness identification arises from an identification procedure that was conducted by the police, the identification is not admissible under art. 12 of the massachusetts declaration of rights if the defendant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the identification was 'so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentificationpage 125that its admission would deprive the defendant of his right to due process.'""  commonwealth v. johnson,, 596-597 (2016), quoting from commonwealth v. walker,, 599 (2011).  in such circumstances, ""we review a judge's findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous but review without deference the judge's application of the law to the facts as found.""  johnson, supra at 602.the defendant contends that the identification procedure employed by the police was impermissibly and unnecessarily suggestive, because the victim saw a police report naming the defendant as one of his assailants before the victim identified the defendant in the photo array.the argument is fundamentally flawed.  first, the victim's ability to recognize the defendant's picture in the photo array was not influenced by the report; indeed, the victim was very familiar with the defendant before the attack.  moreover, the police report cited by the defendant as the source of the alleged suggestiveness did not include an image of the defendant, and therefore could not have been the source of the victim's ability to recognize the defendant's photograph as an image of the defendant.the defendant's claim amounts, in substance, to a contention that the victim's assertion that the defendant was among his assailants was a product of the victim's review of a police report naming the defendant among the alleged assailants.  as such, the claim is not that the report influenced the victim's ability to spot the defendant's picture in the array of possible attackers, but that it influenced his memory of who had attacked him.  in the circumstances, the motion judge did not err in concluding that the possibility of such influence did not make the procedure ""so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification that its admission would deprive the defendant of his right to due process.""  johnson, supra at 597.  the matter is an appropriate topic for cross-examination at trial, and ultimately goes to the weight of the victim's testimony, not its admissibility.  the motion to suppress the identification was properly denied.voluntariness of statements.  the defendant asserts that his statements to police were involuntary because they were products of improper police-initiated promises of leniency and assurances that his statements would aid in his defense.  ""it is well establishedpage 126that a confession or an admission is admissible in evidence only if it is made voluntarily.""  commonwealth v. tremblay,, 206 (2011).  ""the test for voluntariness of a defendant's statement is 'whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement, the will of the defendant was overborne to the extent that the statement was not the result of a free and voluntary act.'""  commonwealth v. mccowen,, 471 (2010), quoting from commonwealth v. selby,, 663 (1995).  ""factors relevant to the totality of the circumstances include whether promises or other inducements were made to the defendant by the police, as well as the defendant's age, education, and intelligence; experience with the criminal justice system; and his physical and mental condition, including whether the defendant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.""  commonwealth v. durand,, 596 (2010), s.c.,(2016), cert. denied, 138 s. ct. 259 (2017).

[131-132]this court concluded that a conviction that was properly obtained without the provision of appointed counsel in circumstances in which there was no possibility of incarceration could be used in a subsequent prosecution for a crime that carried the possibility of incarceration, where neither the sixth amendment to the united states constitution nor art. 12 of the massachusetts declaration of rights forbids the use of a constitutionally valid conviction in a subsequent case. [132-133]at the trial of a complaint charging operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, g. l. c. 90, § 24(1)(a)(1), in light of evidence that a hospital blood test revealed a serum alcohol level that was the equivalent of a blood alcohol level between .30 and .32 percent, and that the results of the test appeared in the defendant's medical records approximately two hours after a motor vehicle accident involving him, the trier of fact was well justified in finding that the blood alcohol level was measured within a reasonable time of the defendant's operation; accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's guilt under a theory that he had a blood alcohol level of .08 or greater; moreover, the jury were entitled to disbelieve the defendant's testimony during his defense that he consumed the alcohol between the time of the accident and the blood draw.

the new hampshire court documents say nothing either way about counsel, and the defendant testified merely that he did not remember.  the presumption of regularity, however, can carry the commonwealth only so far.  as the defendant points out, there is (and was) no possibility of incarceration for a new hampshire first offense of oui.  see n.h. rev. stat. ann.   § 265-a:18(i)(a) (2014); n.h. rev. stat. ann. § 625:9(iv)(b) (2016).as in massachusetts, see lavallee v. justices in the hampden superior ct.,, 241 & n.15 (2004), new hampshire recognizes no right to appointed counsel in a criminal proceeding in which there is no possibility of incarceration.  state v. weeks, 141 n.h. 248, 250 (1996).  accord state v. westover, 140 n.h. 375, 377-379 (1995).  accordingly, although we may presume that the defendant's right to retain counsel at his own expense, see commonwealth v. cote,, 711 (2009), was properly honored, see saunders, 435 mass. at 694, 696, thepage 132presumption of regularity gives us no confidence that the defendant was offered appointed counsel in new hampshire.  indeed, the presumed regularity would be that the defendant was not offered appointed counsel.we must, therefore, address the question whether a conviction, properly obtained without the provision of appointed counsel because there was no possibility of incarceration, may be used in a subsequent prosecution for a crime that carries the possibility of incarceration.  the united states supreme court has squarely held that this is permissible under the sixth amendment to the united states constitution.  nichols v. united states, 511 u.s. 738, 748-749 (1994).the court observed that enhancement statutes ""do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction,"" and that repeat-offender laws punish ""only the last offense committed by the defendant.""  id. at 747.  the court reasoned that the ""logical consequence"" of the constitutional validity of an uncounseled conviction is that it may be used to ""enhance the sentence for a subsequent offense.""  id. at 747.  many, though by no means all, of our sister states have followed suit.absent direction from the supreme judicial court, we see no reason why art. 12 of the massachusetts declaration of rights would forbid the use of a constitutionally valid conviction in a subsequent case.  it is easy to understand why a conviction obtained in violation of a defendant's right to counsel may notpage 133return to enhance a defendant's sentence in the future.  the convictions here, however, were obtained in full accordance with the defendant's constitutional rights.  in our view, it would be strange if art. 12 created classes of convictions, some of which are permitted but then may not be acknowledged in the next case.there can be little doubt that a conviction provides more confidence when the defendant was represented by counsel at trial.  nonetheless, a conviction obtained without counsel because the defendant was found not indigent but declined to retain counsel is fully admissible.  commonwealth v. delorey,, 325-326, 329-331 (1975).  similarly, a conviction where the defendant chose to represent himself is fully admissible.  see mcmullin, 76 mass. app. ct. at 905.  respect for the defendant's constitutional rights, see commonwealth v. martin,, 720-721 (1997), not increments in reliability, must be the touchstone here.moreover, the contrary rule would pose some serious problems for the administration of justice.  crimes such as disorderly conduct, g. l. c. 272, § 53(b), and shoplifting, g. l. c. 266, § 30a, where a first offense is punishable only by a fine, could never be prosecuted for a subsequent offense punishable by incarceration, unless by some happenstance the defendant retained counsel or the prosecution was joined with other, more serious charges.  the presumption of regularity would lose much of its force if courts were required to go beyond the presumption and determine whether the regularity in each case resulted in a conviction that counted in the future.  seeing no constitutional basis to require such a regime, we conclude that the new hampshire convictions here were properly considered as predicates for the defendant's conviction as a fourth offender.3.  sufficiency of the evidence.  when reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, ""we consider the evidence introduced at trial in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""  commonwealth v. oberle,, 547 (2017).  ""the inferences that support a conviction 'need only be reasonable and possible; [they] need not be necessary or inescapable.'""  commonwealth v. waller,, 303 (2016), quoting from commonwealth v. woods,, 713 (2014).  here, the commonwealth was required to ""prove that the defendant (1) physically operated a vehicle; (2) 'on a publicpage 134way or place to which the public has a right of access; and (3) had a blood alcohol content percentage of .08 or greater or was impaired by the influence of intoxicating liquor.'""  commonwealth v. adonsoto,, 509 (2016), quoting from commonwealth v. zeininger,, 778, cert. denied, 565 u.s. 967 (2011).  only the third element is contested by the defendant.a breathalyzer test performed within a ""reasonable time"" of operation is admissible to show a defendant's blood alcohol level at the time of operation.  commonwealth v. colturi,, 816 (2007).  three hours is presumptively a ""reasonable time,"" subject to the ""facts and circumstances in particular cases.""  id. at 816-817.  moreover, ""a breathalyzer test result showing a blood alcohol level of .08 or above, administered within a 'reasonable time' of the operation of a motor vehicle, as that phrase was defined in colturi, is sufficient to prove a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt . . . under the 'per se' theory.""  commonwealth v. dacosta,, 389 (2014).  these teachings apply as well when the blood alcohol level was measured by a blood test, rather than by a breathalyzer.  commonwealth v. douglas,, 652 (2009).here, the hospital blood test revealed a serum alcohol level that was the equivalent of a blood alcohol level of between .30 percent and .32 percent.  although the portion of the medical records admitted at trial does not record the time that the defendant's blood was drawn, the results appear in the medical records prior to the description of the doctor's examination at 4:38 p.m. (approximately two hours after the accident).  in light of this evidence, and the commonsense idea that the routine drawing of blood for a motor vehicle accident victim would not ordinarily wait for the conclusion of a doctor's examination, the trier of fact was well justified in finding that the blood alcohol level was measured within a ""reasonable time"" of the defendant's operation.  see commonwealth v. fernandes,, 739 (2018) (jury may draw reasonable inferences).  accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's guilt under a theory that he had a blood alcohol level of .08 or greater.  see dacosta, 85 mass. app. ct. at 389.during the defendant's case, the defendant testified that he consumed the alcohol between the time of the accident and the time of the blood draw.  the jury, however, were entitled to disbelieve his testimony.  see commonwealth v. ross,,page 135381 (2017).  accordingly, the evidence remained sufficient to support the defendant's conviction at the close of all evidence.because the jury specified that they convicted the defendant under both the theory that he had a blood alcohol level of .08 or greater and on a theory of impairment, we need find sufficient evidence on only one of the two theories to affirm the conviction.  see commonwealth v. mercado,, 155 (2013).  accordingly, we need not discuss whether the evidence was also sufficient on a theory of impairment.judgment affirmed.",criminal,David E.

[138-141] milkey, j., concurring.","following a jury trial in the superior court, the defendant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child,subsequent offense,and sentenced to fifteen years to fifteen years and one day in state prison.on appeal, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to supportpage 137his convictions.  we agree and therefore reverse the judgments and set aside the verdicts.facts.  in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, the jury could have found the following facts.  jane (a pseudonym), a thirteen year old girl, was an intern at an aviation company in the summer of 2014.  while she was working one day, the defendant, an almost sixty year old man who she had met before at the airport, waved her over to him.  after a brief conversation, the defendant told her he would like to get her a gift for her upcoming birthday.  he said that he would like to give her a hug, but that they should do it in another room.  jane went into a nearby hallway for a while, and waited, then returned to work after a couple of minutes.  when she later saw him again in the airplane hangar, she asked if the defendant still wanted the hug,and he hugged her briefly around the shoulders.the defendant then asked if jane wanted another hug, and said that they should go into another room.  he led her to a separate room, with no one else present.  he gave her a second hug, a little tighter, with a kiss on the neck.  this was not ""anything that necessarily alarmed [her]"" because she believed it was consistent with the way people of ""european descent"" greeted each other.the defendant then gave jane a third hug without her permission, which was lower down, on her waist and hips.  he held her ""very tight . . . like a hug [she] would receive from [her] parents.""  at this point, she felt ""a little bit alarmed"" and thought the defendant's behavior was ""kind of odd.""the defendant then stepped back with one hand grabbing her polo shirt at her right hip, ""lifting it slightly,"" but not exposing or touching any of her skin.  he also grabbed jane's hand.  after starting to lift the shirt, he paused, and put it down.  he then asked her to turn around, and she did, becoming increasingly concerned.  the defendant then told her she was very tall, and walked out ofpage 138the room.discussion.  at the close of the commonwealth's case, the defendant moved for required findings of not guilty, which was denied.  the defendant argues that the judge erred because there was insufficient evidence to establish that the assaults in question were indecent.  in reviewing the motion's denial, we examine ""whether the commonwealth produced enough evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, to satisfy any rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that each element of the crime was present.""  commonwealth v. hilton,, 64 (1986).  see commonwealth v. latimore,, 676-678 (1979).  no essential element of the crime may be left to a jury's conjecture, surmise, or guesswork.  commonwealth v. kelley,, 88 (1971).to sustain a conviction for indecent assault and battery on a child, the commonwealth must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that (1) the child was not yet fourteen years old at the time of the offense, (2) the defendant intentionally touched the child without legal justification or excuse, and (3) the touching was indecent.  see g. l. c. 265, § 13b.  see also instruction 6.500 of the criminal model jury instructions for use in the district court (3d ed. 2009).  there is no issue on appeal as to the sufficiency of the evidence on the first two elements.  there is also no real dispute as to the facts as they could be found, in the light most favorable to the commonwealth.  the question is whether, on those facts, the evidence was sufficient to establish that the defendant's touching of jane was ""indecent.""we have ""held that the intentional, unjustified touching of private areas such as 'the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and pubic area of a female'"" is indecent pursuant to the statute.  commonwealth v. mosby,, 184-185 (1991), quoting from commonwealth v. de la cruz,, 59 (1982).  these areas have been ""classified as sexual parts of the body.""  commonwealth v. rosa,, 625 (2004).  the list is not exhaustive, however, and ""a touching need not be confined to these listed areas of the body to be deemed indecent.""  commonwealth v. miozza,, 571 (2006).  indeed, in addition to the listed areas, the mouth and its interior have been held to be intimate parts of the body, in certainpage 139circumstances.  see commonwealth v. mamay,, 418 (1990) (doctor's tongue inserted into patient's mouth); commonwealth v. castillo,, 566-567 (2002) (defendant forced his tongue into mouth of his stepdaughter's fourteen year old girl friend).there is no allegation here that the defendant had any physical contact with jane involving any of the body parts that previously have been held to be intimate.  we recognize that, in certain circumstances, ""the touching of other intimate parts . . . may violate contemporary views of personal integrity and privacy.""  commonwealth v. vazquez,, 307 (2005).  ""[i]ntimacy, as regards parts of the body, must be viewed within the context in which the contact takes place.""  commonwealth v. rosa, 62 mass. app. ct. at 625, quoting from  people v. rivera, 525 n.y.s.2d 118, 119 (n.y. sup. ct. 1988).""when evaluating evidence of alleged indecent behavior, we consider all of the circumstances.""  commonwealth v. castillo, 55 mass. app. ct. at 566.  our caselaw has established that an indecent touching is one that is ""fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values,"" commonwealth v. mosby, 30 mass. app. ct. at 184 (quotation omitted), and that ""society would regard as immodest and improper because of its sexual overtones.""  commonwealth v. ortiz,, 779 (1999).  the test for indecency is objective, turning on the nature of the conduct rather than the defendant's intent.  see commonwealth v. lavigne,, 314 (1997).in the past we have looked to any disparity in age and sophistication between the parties to inform our understanding of the act in question.  see commonwealth v. castillo, 55 mass. app. ct. at 567.  here the disparity between the almost sixty year old defendant and thirteen year old jane was substantial.  we have also looked to the existing relationship between the parties as well as any surreptitious behavior.  see ibid.  here, the defendant was not well-known to jane, and the defendant led her to a more private area.  with this context, the jury readily could have found, not only that the defendant's actions were inappropriate, but that he knew that they were so.  the narrow question before us is not whether the defendant's actions were wrong, but whether his conduct amounted to an indecent touching.  thus, context alone is not determinative and we must further examine the touchings alleged.as to the hug, jane described it as tight, like a hug that her parents would give her, tending to suggest that, though overlypage 140familiar, the contact itself was not sexual.  no suggestive comments, propositions, or gestures accompanied the hug, compare commonwealth v. rosa, 62 mass. app. ct. at 624 (defendant stuck his thumb into mouth of eleven year old neighbor girl and asked her if she knew how to suck on it, if she wanted to suck on it, if she wanted to make it wet), and there was no indication that the contact lasted for any noteworthy amount of time.  compare commonwealth v. vazquez, 65 mass. app. ct. at 309 (uncle's open mouthed kiss on lips of twelve year old niece lasted longer than familiar peck on cheek).  certainly, contact taking place during a hug may constitute indecency.  see, e.g. commonwealth v. holman,, 792-793 (2001) (defendant rubbed buttocks of his girl friend's twelve year old daughter while hugging her).  here, however, there were no such additional circumstances present.considering the incident in the context of its attendant circumstances and in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence to establish that the hug intruded upon a private or intimate area of the body so as to be considered ""indecent"" within the meaning of the criminal statute.as to the defendant grabbing jane's shirt at the hip and lifting it, here too the commonwealth's evidence was insufficient to establish indecency.  we have held previously that, in certain circumstances, removing a person's clothes may constitute indecent assault and battery.  see commonwealth v. kopsala,, 393 (2003) (upholding conviction for indecent assault and battery where defendant ""pulled up the victim's shirt, exposing her breasts, unbuttoned her jeans and pulled them off, and removed her panties"").  see also a.p. v. m.t.,, 164 (2017) (in certain circumstances, removing dress and underwear of four year old child could constitute indecent assault and battery).in contrast to the conduct in those cases, however, the defendant's slight lifting of jane's shirt at her hip resulted in no exposure of any part of her body, let alone any intimate part.  again, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the defendant's conduct intruded upon a private or intimate area of the body so as to be considered ""indecent"" within the meaning of the criminal statute.in holding that the evidence was insufficient in this case, we note that analysis of the evidence of alleged indecent contact ispage 141highly fact-specific.  while the defendant's general conduct toward jane may well have crossed acceptable norms of appropriate behavior, we cannot say that the touchings themselves, even in context, were indecent for purposes of a criminal conviction for indecent assault and battery under g. l. c. 265, § 13b.  for the reasons stated above, the judgments are reversed and the verdicts are set aside.judgment shall enter for the defendant.judgment reversed.verdict set aside.judgment for the defendant.(concurring).  jane (a pseudonym) testified that the defendant gave her a close hug ""like [she] would receive from [her] parents.""  she also testified that, as he was pulling away from the hug, the defendant lifted the bottom of her polo shirt ""slightly,"" without touching or exposing any skin.  based on such conduct, the defendant was convicted of two counts of indecent assault and battery on a person under the age of fourteen, g. l. c. 265, § 13b, and sentenced to fifteen years in state prison.  i agree with the majority's conclusion that, as a matter of law, the defendant's conduct -- while improper -- did not rise to the level of an ""indecent"" assault and battery.  ante at 140.  i also agree that none of the existing cases has held that conduct of this nature could be considered indecent.  nevertheless, our cases include some expansive pronouncements that lend support to the commonwealth's position, and thereby provide encouragement to the type of prosecution here.  i write separately to express my view that the case before us presents an appropriate opportunity to revisit such language.the narrow question we face is not whether the defendant's conduct was improper or even illegal.  instead, it is whether the legislature intended that such conduct amounted to an ""indecent"" assault and battery of a child, an offense the legislature consideredpage 142so heinous that it merits severe mandatory sanctions.thus, the case goes to the heart of what it means for a touching to be indecent.as the majority well explains, an intentional, unjustified touching of certain enumerated body parts -- such as genitalia, buttocks, and female breasts -- is deemed indecent under the statute.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. mosby,, 184 (1991).  cases involving the touching of such off-limits areas therefore generally are straightforward.difficulties arise where, as here, there has been no contact with any of those areas, but the defendant nevertheless has touched the person in a manner that could be considered improper.  our cases hold that such a touching still could be found to have been ""indecent,"" and they set forth a number of general guiding principles to assist in resolving that issue.  in this manner, we have pronounced that a touching can be indecent if it violates ""contemporary views of personal integrity and privacy,""if it is ""fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values,""or if it is ""immodest and improper because of its sexual overtones.""if the just-quoted principles are indeed what is supposed to guide the fact finder, then we should be affirming the conviction before us.  here, a man who was almost sixty years old brought a thirteen year old girl he had only recently met to a back room where he improperly gave her a close hug and briefly started topage 143lift the bottom of her shirt.  to state what i believe is obvious, jurors readily could consider such conduct as flouting contemporary societal norms, as violating the victim's ""personal integrity and privacy,"" and as having ""sexual overtones.""accordingly, if we are to hold -- as i agree we should - that the defendant's conduct was not ""indecent,"" then it must be because our prior pronouncements are too expansive as to how they define that term.to be sure, the term ""indecent"" emits of a broad range of definitions, some of which support the commonwealth's position.  for example, one commonly used dictionary sets a bar that is markedly low and indefinite for what it means for something to be ""indecent.""  see american heritage dictionary of the english language 891 (5th ed. 2016) (defining ""indecent"" to mean ""[o]ffensive to accepted standards of decency or modesty; lewd or vulgar . . . [n]ot appropriate or becoming; unseemly"").  but under the rule of lenity, ambiguity in the meaning of a statutory term must be resolved in favor of a defendant.  see commonwealth v. williamson,, 679 (2012), quoting from commonwealth v. roucoulet,, 652 (1992) (""[w]hen a criminal statute can 'plausibly be found to be ambiguous,' the rule of lenity applies, and we 'give the defendant the benefit of the ambiguity'"").  indeed, the interpretation proffered by the commonwealth - in my view - rests on notions of impropriety so vague as to raise due process concerns.  a more narrow interpretation is necessary to avoid those concerns.  see commonwealth v. kenney,, 850 (2007), quoting from commonwealth v. orlando,, 734 (1977) (""it is well established that due process requires criminal statutes that are not 'sufficiently explicit to give clear warning as to proscribed activities' to be declared unconstitutional"").  see also commonwealth v. carpenter,, 521 (1950) (""the vice of thepage 144ordinance [prohibiting 'sauntering or loitering' in a street] lies in its failure to prescribe any standard capable of intelligent human evaluation to enable one chargeable with its violation to discover those conditions which convert conduct which is prima facie lawful into that which is criminal""), and cases cited.  put simply, courts have a responsibility to make explicit where the boundaries of illegality are drawn.  the role of a jury should be to decide whether a defendant has committed the offense charged, not to resolve what that crime is.how then should courts draw the line between an ordinary assault and battery and an indecent one in cases that do not involve the touching of one of the forbidden body parts?  in my view, mere sexual ""overtones"" are not enough.  instead, the contact should be required to be overtly sexual based on objective standards.in other words, for a touching to be indecent, it would have to involve a level of physical invasiveness comparable to the touching of one of the forbidden body parts.a hug like a parent would give and the ""slight[]"" lifting of the bottom of jane's shirt do not meet that standard.notably, adhering to such a standard would not have left the commonwealth without a remedy here.  had the commonwealthpage 145wanted to, it plainly could have prosecuted the unwanted hug and the slight lifting of the bottom of jane's shirt as simple assault and batteries.  moreover, the commonwealth could have asked the judge to take the particular nature of these touchings into account as a factor to be considered during sentencing.the fact that the commonwealth did not pursue that sensible course of action is due in part to the undue breadth of our prior pronouncements.",criminal,David E.

[152-155]","the defendant appeals from a superior court order, entered after hearing, that revoked her probation.  the judge found that the defendant had violated her probation conditions by failing to make required weekly restitution payments and violating a no-contact condition by contacting a newspaper to make a threat against the victim, who then saw it published in an article in the newspaper.  the judge sentenced her to from three and onepage 147-half to five years in state prison.  we affirm.background.  on july 17, 2015, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of larceny over $250, involving embezzlement from her brother's (victim) construction business in brockton, where she had worked as a bookkeeper.  the defendant had been indicted on sixteen charges; at the time of her guilty plea, the remaining fifteen charges were dismissed.  the judge sentenced her to five years of probation, with conditions, among others, that she:  (1) make restitution to the victim of $103,753.64, which the judge stated was ""a substantial break off of what was . . . allegedly stolen,"" to be paid at the rate of $1000 per week; (2) stay away from the victim's residence and place of employment, and have no ""direct or indirect contact"" with him, his wife, or their children; and (3) execute a financial affidavit ""stating that there are no available funds remaining from [her 2012] lottery winnings and no other funds or monies available.""after having been given a weekend to consider this disposition, the defendant had represented to the judge that she was able to pay the $1000 weekly amount.  the defendant signed, thereby agreeing to obey, the order of probation conditions.four days later, on july 21, the defendant filed her financial affidavit, in which she stated that she had exhausted her $455,000 in lottery winnings.  in the affidavit the defendant failed, however, to account for $81,000 of those winnings, and did not assert any inability to pay the restitution as ordered and agreed.on august 14, the defendant was issued a notice of surrender and hearing for alleged violations of probation (notice of probation violation) alleging that she had violated two probation conditions:  failure to make restitution payments and violation of the no-contact condition.at an initial probation violation hearing on august 17, a probation officer represented that the defendant had made the first restitution payment, due july 24, but had missed the payments due july 31 and august 7, and made only a partial payment on august 15.  the probation officer further represented that the defendant had violated the no-contact condition by makingpage 148comments about the victim in an article that appeared on july 28 in a local newspaper, the enterprise.  defense counsel then informed the judge that the defendant had lost her job.  the judge (who had been the sentencing judge) expressed concern that the defendant, so soon after receiving a relatively lenient disposition of which the carefully-considered and agreed-upon restitution condition was a significant component, had apparently violated that condition.  he ordered the defendant held without bail pending a final probation violation hearing.at that hearing, on september 11, the victim testified that after the defendant had pleaded guilty, the victim had made comments about her, including that she was a ""scum bag,"" in an article about the case that appeared in the enterprise on july 17.  the victim described the enterprise as the ""most widely published newspaper in the brockton area.""  on july 28, a second article appeared in the enterprise, stating that the defendant had called the newspaper to say, among other things, that she ""'covered up' things for [the victim] while she was a bookkeeper for his company"" and that she had ""enough evidence against him that will probably put both of us in jail.""  the article further quoted her as saying:  ""i am not guilty for anything. . . .  my attorneys gave me bad advice. . . .  my side of the story is i'm innocent and his day is coming.  justice will be served against him.""the victim testified that he had read this article and had interpreted the defendant's comments as ""threats that she had information that she was going to put [him] . . . in jail.""  the victim explained that seeing the article had affected him emotionally:""i thought that the court case was closed and i had some relief from this whole situation.  and apparently, it just continued. . . .  i tried to close a chapter in my life with her bad doing.  and it's just relentless, the stuff she is saying about me. . . .  i felt that i gave my sister, my bookkeeper, the best possible leniency that i could have.  and then to have it come out in the newspaper that she had information and that . . . she was given wrong counsel when she admitted that she did wrong, that to me was just -- closure wasn't set in and made me feel uptight.""the probation officer then represented to the judge that, before the defendant signed the probation conditions, he had reviewed them with her ""starting from the first condition all the way to thepage 149final signature.""  he had also ""specifically instructed [her], no contact with the victim, direct or indirect,"" and advised her that she ""[could not] have a friend talk for her, have a letter written to another person and have that letter find its way back to the [victim].  it was very clear what third party [indirect] contact was.""  the probation officer had also represented, again, that the defendant had not made all required restitution payments.at that point in the hearing, the judge stated that he was treating the probation officer's statements as evidence and asked defense counsel if he wished to cross-examine the probation officer or offer any evidence for the defendant.  defense counsel declined both invitations.he limited his closing argument to asserting that the defendant had a constitutional right to make comments about the victim in the newspaper, in order to defend her reputation against his prior remarks about her in the same newspaper.the judge rejected the defendant's free speech argument and found that she had violated the no-contact condition of her probation by ""issuing [the victim] a threat.""  with respect to restitution, the judge found:  ""[s]he has not paid the money that she promised to pay.  and i have no evidence before me that it is impossible for her to pay the money.""consequently, he vacated the order of probation and asked for the probation officer's recommendation as to disposition.the probation officer asked for a sentence of three to five years, reminding the judge that at the time the defendant pleaded guilty:""[t]he court was quite clear with its concern with regarding this order.  that the court wanted to make the [victim] whole and was going to take any attempt to make him whole. . . .page 150and as the article suggests, [the defendant] didn't accept responsibility.  and if that's the case, your honor, placing her on probation again is not going to drive that point home any clearer than it would have been on the day that contract was signed.""so for those reasons, i'm asking the sentence be imposed.""defense counsel asked that the defendant be reprobated.the judge then reviewed the defendant's record, which included being placed on probation in 1999 for an attempted larceny conviction; in 2005 after charges of larceny over $250, uttering, and forgery were continued without a finding; in 2013 for two larceny by check convictions; and for a different larceny over $250 conviction.  the judge stated, ""she's been placed on probation quite a few times . . .[and] it was very

nowhere within it did she state that she was unable to make the payments.  nor did the defendant support her motion to modify probation conditions, which she filed more than two weeks after the notice of probation violation had issued and which was denied on september 11, with any affidavit or other evidence of inability to pay; the assertions of her counsel are not evidence.  see id. at 212.section 6(b) of the guidelines for probation violation proceedings in the superior court (2016), http://www.mass.gov/service-details/guidelines-for-probation-violation-proceedings-in-the-superior-court [https://perma.cc/fp63-d6ue], governing final probation violation hearings, codifies preexisting practice by calling for an evidentiary hearing.see, e.g., commonwealth v. ventura,, 203-204 (2013).  a judge conductingpage 152such a hearing, no less than the probationer, is entitled to require evidence of an alleged violation, as well as evidence of any defense thereto.  here the defendant offered no evidence at all in support of her defense of inability to pay restitution.we therefore see no error in the judge's finding that the defendant violated the restitution condition of probation, including his implicit finding that the nonpayment was wilful, as is required for the nonpayment to warrant revocation.see henry, 475 mass. at 121, 124 n.6.2.  violation of no-contact condition.  the defendant argues that the judge violated the defendant's free speech rights under the federal and state constitutions when he found that she had violated the no-contact condition by making statements about the victim in an article published in a newspaper.  she contends that she was not attempting to contact the victim, but was merely exercising her right to free speech in a public forum by responding to the victim's disparaging remarks that appeared in an earlier article in the same newspaper.  on these specific facts, we disagree.the defendant's constitutional argument is that her statementspage 153to the newspaper, because they did not constitute a constitutionally unprotected ""true threat,"" could not be viewed as violating the no-contact condition.  although the defendant is correct that her remarks were not a ""true threat,""she overlooks an important principle governing a probation condition such as hers.""judges are permitted significant latitude in imposing conditions of probation, . . . and '[a] probation condition is not necessarily invalid simply because it affects a probationer's ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights.'""  commonwealth v. rousseau,, 389-390 (2013) (quotation omitted).  courts have previously upheld conditions of probation that affect first amendment rights so long as they are ""reasonably related to a valid probation purpose.""  commonwealth v. power,, 417 (1995), cert. denied, 516 u.s. 1042 (1996).  see commonwealth v. obi,, 547-548 (2016).  ""the principal goals of probation are rehabilitation of the defendant and protection of the public.""  commonwealth v. lapointe,, 459 (2001).  accord rousseau, 465 mass. at 390.  a probation condition forbidding contact with, including threats to, the victim has a clear rational relationship to both of these goals:  encouraging the defendant's acceptance of responsibility for the crime and protecting the victim, as a member of the public, from further harm, whether emotional, physical, or financial, at the hands of the defendant.  the defendant does not argue that these are not valid goals, or that the no-contact condition, as applied here, trenched more broadly on her free speech rights than necessary to achieve these goals.""[n]o contact"" probation conditions, as well as ""the term 'no contact' in the related context of g. l. c. 209a protective orders,"" have been read broadly ""to foreclose a myriad of potential encounters, engagements, or communications between people.""  commonwealth v. kendrick,, 75-76 (2006).  see commonwealth v. consoli,, 741 (2003) (""our broadly protective interpretation of 'contacts,' an interpretationpage 154fully consistent with the statutory purpose [of g. l. c. 209a], means that one cannot undermine a no contact order by the simple expedient of ricocheting prohibited comments off of third parties"").the defendant here makes no argument that the no-contact condition of probation was insufficiently clear to put her on notice that contact made through her directing comments at the victim through a newspaper article was prohibited.  see kendrick, 446 mass. at 75, quoting from commonwealth v. orlando,, 734 (1977) (no-contact probation condition constitutionally sufficient where, although ""imprecise,"" it provided ""comprehensible normative standard so that [people] of common intelligence will know its meaning"").  the probation officer had warned the defendant that contact through third parties was prohibited.  she nevertheless took the initiative to contact the newspaper to make statements about the victim that he could, and did, reasonably understand as threats.indeed, the judge found that her statements constituted ""issuing [the victim] a threat.""  as defense counsel conceded before this court at oral argument, the defendant should reasonably have known that her statements to the newspaper about the victim would come to the victim's attention.we thus see no error in the judges finding and conclusion that, in these circumstances, the defendant's remarks violated apage 155valid no-contact condition of probation.conclusion.  the judge did not err in revoking the defendant's probation based on his well-supported findings that the defendant had violated her probation conditions by failing to adhere to the restitution payment schedule and the terms of the no-contact condition.order revoking probation and imposing sentence affirmed.",criminal,"Cornelius J.

right of ""commonage"" along with other inhabitants of the town.  the trial judge bifurcated the ""public"" portions of the case -- the claims among the plaintiffs, the commonwealth, and the town -- and, following a trial, concluded that the plaintiffs had not met their burden of demonstrating title sufficient to quiet title or remove the cloud of title due to the decisions in thomas i and thomas

v. souza, 27 mass. app. 1142, 1143 (1989).marshfield neck is a narrow plot of land that lies south of the south river, north of the green harbor river, and is bordered to the east by massachusetts bay.  rexhame terrace is a subdivision created by sarah ames in the late 1800s from a portion of her large farm on marshfield neck.  as laid out on a revised 1891 subdivision plan, rexhame terrace is bordered by circuit avenue east to the east.a beach abutting massachusetts bay lies east of circuit avenue east.  the six ""beach lots"" at issue lie betweenpage 158circuit avenue east and either the low or high water mark of massachusetts bay, on what is shown on the 1891 plan as ""marshfield beach.""the beach lots are not shown on the subdivision plans.  the parties indicated at oral argument that the beach lots are essentially coastal uplands and are not buildable lots.the beach lots were created and first conveyed between 1910 and 1913 by individual deeds from sarah ames's son, ray ames.  the thrust of the issue before us is whether ray ames had title to any of the beach lots when he originally conveyed them to the plaintiffs' predecessors in title.  the resolution of this issue brings us back to the original settlers of the town in the mid-1600s.the parties agree that joseph beadle was the first settler of the property at issue.  the judge found that of the properties transferred to beadle by the town and others in the mid-1600s, only one deed from the town bounded his property ""east with the beach.""  the parties' title experts agreed that at that time, bounding a lot ""with"" the beach did not pass title to the beach.  other parcels transferred to beadle included marshlands, which by definition are inundated with water, proving, according to the plaintiffs, that beadle had acquired property bounded by the ocean.  based on expert evidence that the judge credited, however, he found that the marshlands were on the landward side of the beach and subject to tidal inundation as part of a tidal estuary rather than the ebb and flow of the ocean tide.the beadle farm passed through several families and became known in the 1700s as the kent farm.  when john kent died in 1753, his will divided his estate among his nine living children, and it was at this time that the property began to be described in deeds in terms such as bound by ""the edge of the upland by the [s]ea,"" ""on the edge of the bank about high water mark,"" and ""the edge of the bank by the [s]ea.""  between 1759 and 1770, anthony thomas purchased portions of the kent farm.  in 1787, his estate divided the farm among his three sons.  briggs thomas (thomas) received the portion of the farm that is at issue in this case, along with ""all the [p]rivilege of the beach adjoining [s]aid [l]and.""  by deed recorded july 7, 1858, thomas's farm was conveyed to sarah a. ames, thomas's granddaughter, and was described as being bound ""[e]asterly by the beach or [s]ea.""  sarah ames subsequently granted by will to her seven children, including raypage 159ames, portions of rexhame terrace ""to the sea.""the plaintiffs' titles derive from deeds from ray ames, alone, between 1910 and 1916.in addition, although the town released its interest in a portion of ""the beach"" to ray ames in 1916, the judge concluded, based on the description of the land in the release, expert evidence that he credited, and the fact that ray ames, on the day following the release, transferred to a third party property just north of the property at issue here, that the town's release did not concern the land at issue.the plaintiffs argued that the land grants to joseph beadle originally went to the high water mark, and that as a result of the colonial ordinance, ownership of the tidal flats vested in beadle and ultimately passed to the plaintiffs.  the judge found, however, that the grant to beadle of what became known as the rexhame terrace property was bound by ""the beach,"" as that term was understood in the town in colonial times.  the judge explained that notwithstanding the usual meaning of ""beach"" as the land between the high and low water marks, ""in colonial and historical marshfield [the term] included some 'upland' area above the high water mark"" on which livestock grazed.the judge credited expert evidence that the rexhame beach area had three geographical components:  ""(a) an area of beach below the mean high water area (coastal beach)[;] (b) an elevated dune area landward of the beach (coastal dune)[;] and (c) landward of the dune area, portions of land with wetland characteristics.""  all three, according to the expert, form a ""barrier beach.""  based on other expert evidence he credited, the judge found that ""[v]irtually all of the vegetation"" edible by livestock grew on the landward side of the high water mark on the coastal dune.  the judge carefully reviewed the language of the ancient deeds and the town's grant of commonage rights on the beach in 1645 and determined that thepage 160term ""beach"" clearly included uplands.  the judge concluded that the plaintiffs, therefore, had no title to the beach lots and that title to the beach lots remained in the town.the judge's decision was reinforced by consideration of the supreme judicial court's decisions in thomas i and thomas ii, which, he determined, preclude the plaintiffs from claiming title to the beach lots through the biddle-thomas-ames chain of title.  the thomas litigation was prompted by legislation enacted in 1827 (act) which empowered the town to construct a sea wall to preserve and secure ""the whole of marshfield beach"" and further prohibited ""neat cattle, horses, or sheep,"" that is, livestock, from grazing on the beach.  see st. 1826, c. 81, §§ 1, 2.  the act also provided a mechanism to compensate those having legal title in the beach for harm caused by the statute.  st. 1826, c. 81, § 7.  see thomas i, 10 pick. at 365-366.  thomas sought damages pursuant to the act.  the judge in this case concluded that the rexhame terrace subdivision is located in approximately the same location as the ""unfenced pasture"" of thomas, who is the plaintiffs' and the ameses' predecessor in title.thomas i, issued during the supreme judicial court's october, 1830, term, was preceded by thomas's action in the court of common pleas, which was decided during that court's april, 1830, term.  a transcript of that decision was admitted in evidence at the trial here.  it reflects that thomas alleged in the first count of his complaint that he held the fee in the beach from the north river to his ""fatting pasture.""  the plaintiffs concede that thomas's asserted title would include the beach lots at issue.  the court of common pleas jury, however, rejected thomas's claim of title.  specifically, ""the jury [found] as to the first issue that the complainant had no such title to or in the beach mentioned in his complaint or any part thereof.""  the decision noted that thomas also asserted rights of commonage over the entire beach; the jury rejected those claims as well.on appeal, thomas did not challenge the jury verdict regarding his title claim.  see thomas i, 10 pick. at 366-367.as to the issues presented in thomas i,the supreme judicial court concludedpage 161that the town's 1645 grant of express commonage rights over the beach to a certain neighborhood failed because either (i) the grant was indefinite in that the ""neighborhood"" limits were not defined, or (ii) the grant was of a life estate only.  ibid.  thus, the court concluded thomas had no express commonage rights.  in thomas ii, 13 pick. at 249-250, the supreme judicial court rejected thomas's claim that by allowing his livestock to graze all over the beach, he had acquired title to or an easement in any part of the beach by prescription.  the court concluded that where thomas admitted he had no fee in the beach, his use of a beach kept open to the public and used by others in a similar way could not give rise to a prescriptive easement.  ibid.2.  discussion.  a.  issue preclusion.  the plaintiffs contend that the judge erred as a matter of law when he concluded that the decision of the court of common pleas, rendered final by thomas i and thomas ii, had preclusive effect on the plaintiffs' claim to own the fee in the beach lots.  the plaintiffs insist thomas's title to the beach was not at issue in those cases and that title was not ""actually litigated"" for purposes of issue preclusion.""[i]ssue preclusion 'prevents relitigation of an issue determined in an earlier action where the same issue arises in a later action, based on a different claim, between the same parties or their privies.'""  petrillo v. zoning bd. of appeals of cohasset,, 457 (2006), quoting from heacock v. heacock,, 23 n.2 (1988).  ""before precluding the party from relitigating an issue, 'a court must determine that (1) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior adjudication; (2) the party against whom preclusion is asserted was a party (or in privity with a party) to the prior adjudication; and (3) the issue in the prior adjudication was identical to the issue in the current adjudication.'""  petrillo, 65 mass. app. ct. at 457-458, quoting from tuper v. north adams ambulance serv., inc.,, 134 (1998).  ""additionally, the issue decided in the prior adjudication must have been essential to the earlier judgment[, and i]ssue preclusion can be used only to prevent relitigation of issues actually litigated in the prior action.""  petrillo, 65 mass. app. ct. at 458, quoting from kobrin v. board of registration in med.,, 844 (2005).contrary to the plaintiffs' contention, the issue of thomas'spage 162title to the beach was clearly raised and expressly decided in the court of common pleas.the jury in that action specifically concluded that thomas did not own the fee in any portion of the beach, and thomas did not pursue an appeal of that decision.  in pursuing the appeals in thomas i and thomas ii, he accepted that portion of the decision that concluded that he did not hold the fee in any portion of the beach.  as to the issue of title, therefore, the judgment of the court of common pleas, as affirmed on appeal, has preclusive effect.  see guiffrida v. zoning bd. of appeals of falmouth,, 401 (2007) (parties and their privies are barred by unappealed adverse judgment).  see also restatement (second) of judgments § 43(1)(b) (1982) (judgment that determines interest in real property ""[h]as preclusive effects upon a person who succeeds to the interest of a party to the same extent as upon the party himself"").importantly, the act prohibited commonage on the full length of marshfield beach.  while insisting that thomas owned a portion of the beach, the plaintiffs ask us to nonetheless infer that thomas simply chose to pursue only his commonage and prescriptive rights and never pursued any rights arising from his title to a portion of the beach.  thomas's focus on his commonage and prescriptive rights in thomas i and thomas ii makes sense where, having lost on the title issue in the court of common pleas, he conceded that he did not own any portion of the beach.  we cannot, as the plaintiffs suggest, infer from that course of action that he had title to the beach but simply chose to forgo seeking damages for the harm to his title.  indeed, we are hard-pressed to understand how thomas's pursuit of damages for his loss of commonage rights, rather than damages due to the impairment of his title, aids the plaintiffs' current claim to title to the beach.b.  definition of ""the beach.""  even if it were open to the plaintiffs to argue they have title to the beach lots via the chain of title dating back to joseph beadle through ray ames and his successors, they fare no better.  the plaintiffs argue that the judge erred in finding that land conveyed by the town to beadle and other early settlers, described in part as bound by the beach, is not bound by the ocean.  ""the colonial ordinance of 1641-1647 established that a person holding land adjacent to the sea shall hold title to the land out to the low water mark or 100 rods (1,650 feet), whichever is less.""  pazolt v. director of the div. of marine fisheries,, 570 (1994).the plaintiffs contend that 310 code mass. regs. § 10.27 (1997), defines a coastal beach as land subject to ebb and flow of the tide and, therefore, bounding a lot by the beach is the equivalent of bounding it by the high water line.  they argue, also, that the transfer of marshes, which by definition are inundated with water, necessarily means the property directly abutted the ocean.our cases have recognized that although the primary definition of beach is the area between high water mark and low water mark, ""[t]he term has a flexible meaning depending upon the setting in which it is employed.""  anderson v. devries,, 133 (1950).  see lund v. cox, 281 mass. 484, 491 (1933); hewitt v. perry,, 104 (1941).  relying on the town's grant of commonage or grazing rights on the beach in 1645, expert evidence that cattle do not graze below the high water mark, and the fact a ""highway"" was laid out on ""the beach"" in 1692, the judge concluded that the term ""beach"" in the early deeds clearly included uplands and did not consist solely of the land between high and low water marks.  the plaintiffs' reliance on inflexible, current definitions of ""beach"" do nothing to diminish the judge's reasoned analysis of the early colonial deeds.  that deeds beginning in the mid-1700s, nearly 100 years later, began to describe the property as bound by the sea or high water mark does not alter the original deeds and conveys no new rights.  one cannot convey what one does not own.  see bongaards v. millen,, 15 (2003).the judge carefully considered whether the transfer of marshland meant that the early settlers obtained property bounded by the ocean or sea.  the judge's conclusion that the marshes were on the landward side of the beach is consistent with their descriptionpage 164as lying between certain land ""and the beach.""  moreover, the judge credited the plaintiffs' expert's testimony that there was no marsh on the beach side facing the ocean; marshlands were on the inland side of the tidal estuary of the green harbor river.  the judge concluded from historical maps and expert evidence that ""the beach"" included land above the high water between the marshes and the sea.  considering the totality of the evidence, we cannot say the judge erred in concluding that the early settlers of what became the rexhame terrace property did not receive title to the beach, including the uplands, claimed by the plaintiffs.c.  superior title.  the judge found that the town has superior title to the beach ""including the tidal flats together with all or a portion of the upland beach lots which abut the seashore,"" but concluded that he had insufficient evidence to definitively determine the boundaries of the town's property.  the judge did conclude, however, that the town owns a ""sufficient portion of the upland area so as to vest title to it in rexhame beach including the tidal flats to the low water mark.""  the plaintiffs essentially argue that the town cannot have superior title if it has not proven exactly what it owns.  any flaws in the town's title, however, do not aid the plaintiffs in their efforts to quiet title to the beach lots or remove the cloud created by thomas i and thomas ii.  separate and apart from the strength of the town's title, the judge determined, and we agree, that the plaintiffs did not receive title to the beach lots because their predecessors in title never had title to give.the plaintiffs point out that the town's assertion of title to the beach is a ""recent claim,"" that the town collected taxes from the beach lot owners for many years, and that the town contended in thomas i and thomas ii that the commonwealth owned the beach.  the plaintiffs make no legal argument with proper citation to authority, however, that the town is thereby prohibited from asserting its title now.  see baird v. massachusetts bay transp. authy.,, 495-499 (1992) (argument does not meet requirements of mass.r.a.p. 16[a][4], as amended,  367 mass. 921  [1975], when ""unsupported by citation or articulated reasoning"").page 165d.  cross appeals.  finally, in their cross appeals, the commonwealth and the town argue that the judge erroneously shifted the burden of proof to them to establish the western boundary of the ""beach"" or, as the judge put it, the land formerly designated as commonage existing between the thomas farm and the seashore.  having asserted title to the beach as an affirmative defense in their answers, we discern no error in the judge's conclusion that the town and the commonwealth had the burden of proving the boundary of its property.  see hughes v. williams,, 470 (1918);

accordingly, no action is necessary.""  on april 4, 2017, the defendant filed in the superior court a notice of appeal under g. l. c. 231, § 118, second par.  at oral argument, we raised the question of timeliness of the defendant's appeal, and invited the parties to submit supplemental memoranda addressing the question.discussion.  as the single justice correctly observed, he was without authority to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, then pending in the superior court. see pemberton v. pemberton,, 809 (1980) (""[the] power to render any judgment and to make any order that ought to have been made open the whole case . . . rest[s] solely with a panel of [t]hree justices who constitute a quorum to decide all matters required to be heard by the appeals court"") (internal quotation marks omitted).see also mass.r.a.p. 15(c),  365 mass. 859  (1974) (single justice may not entertain motion to ""dismiss or otherwise determine an appeal or other proceeding"").we are unpersuaded by the defendant's contention that g. l. c. 184, § 15(d), should be construed to override the limitation on the authority of the single justice, in order to give effect to a legislative intent to provide an avenue for an ""expedited dissolutionpage 169of an unjustified memorandum of lis pendens.""  galipault v. wash rock investments, llc, supra at 74.  as a threshold matter, the limitation on the authority of the single justice imposed by mass.r.a.p. 15(c) does not render the right of appeal from a ruling under g. l. c. 184, § 15(c), either illusory or a nullity; the single justice is empowered to grant relief from any order allowing a special motion to dismiss a complaint pursuant to the statute.the defendant is also incorrect in his assertion that the legislature must have intended to allow the single justice to reverse an order denying a special motion to dismiss, in order to avoid the longer time period ordinarily required to pursue a panel appeal; nothing in g. l. c. 184, § 15, says explicitly, or otherwise suggests, that an order of the single justice directing dismissal of a complaint shall be final, or could not thereafter be appealed to the full court.having determined that the single justice correctly determined that he was without authority to dismiss the complaint, we turn to the question of the timeliness of the present appeal.  general laws c. 231, § 118, second par., as amended through st. 1987, c. 208, § 2, prescribes a thirty-day appeal period.the defendant's notice of appeal from the order denying his special motion to dismiss and dissolution of a lis pendens was filed over a month after the thirty-day appeal period had expired.  the appeal period, set by statute, cannot be enlarged.see morales v. appeals court,, 1010 (1998), quoting from friedman v. board of registration in medicine,, 665 (1993) (""[a] statutory appeal period . . . cannot be overridden by a contrary rule of court when the manner and time for effective filing of an appeal are delineated in the statute"").  see also, manousos v. sarkis,page 170, 322 (1981); mcgrath v. mcgrath,, 671 (2006); ben v. schultz,, 814-815 (1999).  a timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to our authority to consider any matter on appeal.  because the trial court lacked the authority to permit the enlargement of time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to g. l. c. 231, § 118, the order purporting to do so was a nullity.  the notice of appeal was untimely, and we accordingly dismiss the appeal.as we observed in the introduction, the operation of the lis pendens statute, together with the statute governing interlocutory appeals and the rule governing the single justice practice, can combine in circumstances such as those in the present case to create a trap for the unwary.such a possibility does not, however, confer jurisdiction where none exists.  in any event, the consequences here are not as harsh as those present in circumstances where a party by procedural misstep loses the right to an adjudication on the merits; the defendant remains entitled to assert in the superior court all grounds on which he contends he should prevail.  moreover, though we are without jurisdiction to consider the merits of the present appeal, our review of the record and the arguments made in the respective parties' briefs persuades us that the superior court judge committed no abuse of discretion in denying the special motion to dismiss; as set forth in the complaint, the plaintiff has asserted a colorable claim that the defendant acted in bad faith to deprive the plaintiff of an interest in real property, after the plaintiff had exercised considerable efforts and brought about considerable value in reliance on the parties' joint venture agreement.  whether the plaintiff is successful in establishing that claim in further proceedings in the superior court remains to be seen.page 171conclusion.  for the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed as untimely.so ordered.",civil,Renee Paula Dupuis,affirm
1642,commonwealth  vs.  jose hernandez.,"firearms.  constitutional law, search and seizure.  search and seizure, consent, container, expectation of privacy.a district court judge did not err in concluding that a criminal defendant's coinhabitant could and did validly consent to a search of the defendant's closed but unlocked suitcase located in the common closet of their shared bedroom in their home, in that the defendant, in coinhabiting as he did and in leaving his gun unlocked in a closet used by all, made a significant sacrifice of individual privacy vis-à-vis his coinhabitant and assumed the risk that she would access his belongings (i.e., the suitcase) or consent to a search of them. [174-178]","this case presents the question whether the defendant's coinhabitant could validly consent to a warrantless search of a closed, unlocked suitcase located in a common closet of a bedroom she shared with the defendant.  a warrantless search of the suitcase yielded a gun, which was the basis of the defendant's convictions.  a district court judge ruled that the coinhabitant's consent was valid as to the suitcase, and that the seizure of the firearm was therefore lawful.  we affirm.1.  background.  a.  incident.on february 3, 2015, at 11:00 a.m., lynn police officer william stilwell responded to a call ofpage 173a domestic threat at the defendant's apartment, and was met by flor prudencio, the victim.  prudencio shared the one-bedroom apartment with the defendant and their three children.   the couple had lived there for three years.  the three children were present when officer stilwell spoke with prudencio, but the defendant was at work.  prudencio advised that the defendant would return in the late afternoon.prudencio reported that approximately three weeks earlier, she and the defendant had had an argument about the custody of the children.  during the argument, the defendant told prudencio that ""if he wasn't able to see the children . . . he would shoot her and kill her.""  prudencio went on to tell the officer that she was concerned because the defendant had access to a firearm.   prudencio then brought the officer into the apartment's only bedroom, which she shared with the defendant and the children.  the bedroom had two beds and a single closet.  prudencio opened the closet door.  inside were men's and women's clothes, bags on the floor, and children's items; some of the items were prudencio's.after opening the closet door, prudencio pointed to a suitcase on the top shelf of the closet, about five feet up; she stated that the defendant's firearm was located in the suitcase.   officer stilwell pulled the suitcase down and brought it into the kitchen.the suitcase was not locked, and did not have a locking mechanism.  prudencio testified that the suitcase was ""easy to open,"" not with a zipper but ""something you press down on,"" like a clasp.  it did not have a name or tag on it.officer stilwell opened the suitcase in prudencio's presence.  prudencio stated that the firearm was inside a red ""huggies"" container within the suitcase.  inside the huggies container officer stilwell found a loaded revolver and a ""baggie"" of ammunition.he confiscated the weapon ""[b]ased on the domestic threat, the threat that was made that [the defendant] said that he was going to shoot her.""prior to opening the suitcase, officer stilwell did not ask prudencio to whom the suitcase belonged, nor did prudencio state whose suitcase it was.  at the suppression hearing prudencio testified that the suitcase and the gun were the defendant's, and that she knew the defendant kept the firearm in the suitcase because on at least three prior occasions he had removed it frompage 174the suitcase, in front of her, and cleaned it.the defendant was charged with improper storage of a firearm, in violation of g. l. c. 140, § 131l(a) and (b); illegal possession of a firearm, in violation of g. l. c. 269, § 10(h); illegal possession of ammunition, in violation of g. l. c. 269, § 10(h); and threatening to commit a crime, in violation of g. l. c. 275, § 2.b.  pretrial and trial.  hernandez filed a motion to suppress all items seized from the apartment.  after an evidentiary hearing where officer stilwell and prudencio testified, the motion judge denied the defendant's motion, issuing written findings.the motion judge first found ""it is clear that [officer] stilwell entered the home . . . with prudencio's consent,"" and that ""prudencio had both actual and apparent authority over the apartment that she and hernandez shared together and with their children.""  regarding the search of the suitcase, the motion judge concluded that prudencio and the defendant shared access to their home, bedroom, and closet, ""as well as the contents of that closet which would include the suitcase.""  she specifically found that ""[t]here was no evidence of any restriction upon prudencio's access to that suitcase or what was inside.""after a jury-waived trial, the same judge found the defendant guilty on all four charges.  this appeal followed.2.  discussion.  in reviewing an order on a motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge's subsidiary findings of fact, absent clear error, and then independently review the ultimate findings and conclusions of law.  commonwealth v. scott,, 646 (2004).in general, a search of a home without a warrant is invalid, but one exception is when the search is conducted with valid ""consent.""  commonwealth v. rogers,, 236-237 (2005).  when the government claims that the search was justified by consent of a third party, rather than the defendant, the government has the burden to show that the third party actually consented through word or action, and that the third party had actual or apparent authority to consent to the search.  see id. at 237-238; commonwealth v. santos,, 694-696 (2013).here, the defendant acknowledges that prudencio actually consentedpage 175orally and, moreover, that she had authority, as the defendant's coinhabitant, to consent to a search of the apartment and of the closet.  but he contends, relying on commonwealth v. porter p.,(2010), and commonwealth v. magri,(2012), that prudencio's authority did not extend to the closed, unlocked suitcase.  in essence, he argues that the police were required to establish that prudencio had separate authority over each closed container in the apartment despite having common authority over the whole of the premises.  before addressing whether porter p. and magri provide support for the defendant's position, we briefly summarize the case law that existed before those cases were published.the defendant's argument is at odds with the ""common authority"" doctrine adopted in a long line of cases beginning with united states v. matlock, 415 u.s. 164 (1974), and running through decisions of this court and porter p. itself.  in matlock, the united states supreme court addressed whether a defendant's adult coinhabitant could validly consent to a search of the bedroom she shared with the defendant, and to the search of a diaper bag found in the bedroom's closet.  id. at 166-167.  the court held that she could; consent could be obtained ""from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.""  id. at 171.  the court went on to explain that consent based on common authority did not arise from ""property interest[s],"" but from""mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.""id. at 171 n.7.as indicated, the facts in matlock involved a container located in the coinhabitant's bedroom, and in holding the consent valid the supreme court did not suggest that additional or separate authority might be required to validate the search of the container.  indeed, the court's reasoning was that coinhabitants have ""assumed the risk,"" vis-à-vis each other, such that any of them can permit a search of a common area, including items kept in such an area.page 176matlock's reasoning was cited approvingly by this court in commonwealth v. noonan,, 362 (1999), in the context of a police search of an apartment based upon the consent of the defendant's coinhabitant (one barbara), where we stated:""they used the apartment just as an ordinary married couple would.  thus barbara had the run of the place with presumptively lawful access to all parts of the apartment and its contents.  so also she could give consent to a search to the same extent by other persons whether or not officers:  where premises are jointly occupied, any occupant may consent 'in his own right' to a search, the other occupant having 'assumed the risk' of such action.""ibid., quoting from matlock, 415 u.s. at 171 n.7.other cases are in accord, finding searches reasonable on very similar facts to those at issue here.  in united states v. bass, 661 f.3d 1299, 1302-1307 (10th cir. 2011), the defendant's coinhabitant authorized the search of the defendant's closed but unlocked ""zipper bag,"" found in a ""common area"" of their home.  the bag contained, among other things, the defendant's revolver.  id. at 1302.  the tenth circuit court of appeals rejected the argument that the coinhabitant's consent to search the home could not extend to the closed but unlocked bag, reasoning that matlock's ""assumption of the risk"" formulation extends at least to ""that portion of the premises which by practice or agreement the other occupant generally uses.""  id. at 1306 (quotation omitted).  the court concluded that ""when general authority is present, we should not look for 'metaphysical subtleties' to define the boundaries of that authority.""  661 f.3d at 1306 (quotation omitted).  see united states v. fay, 410 f.3d 589, 589-590 (9th cir. 2005) (no fourth amendment violation where coinhabitant consented to search of duffle bag on a shelf in an open laundry room).  see also commonwealth v. farnsworth,, 94-97 (2010) (defendant's mother had authority to consent to search of defendant's bedroom).the reasoning of the matlock line of cases was adopted in porter p., where the court stated that ""[a] third party has actual authority to consent to a warrantless search of a home by the police when the third party shares common authority over the home.""  porter p., 456 mass. at 262.  the court went on to quotepage 177with approval matlock's ""assumption of the risk"" rationale, before distinguishing matlock on the ground that in porter p., the person who provided the consent to search -- the director of the transitional shelter in which the defendant was staying -- was not a coinhabitant, and thus not able to validly consent to a search of the defendant's room.  id. at 262, 266.the reasoning of these cases reflects the common understanding that coinhabitants of a home have a greatly diminished expectation of privacy vis-à-vis each other, at least as to ""common areas.""  coinhabitants accordingly can consent to searches in areas where they have ""joint access or control for most purposes.""  porter p., 456 mass. at 262, quoting from matlock, 415 u.s. at 171 n.7.such joint access or control existed here.  there is no question of prudencio's authority to consent to the search of her home, her bedroom, and her closet.  these were ""common areas,"" which was readily apparent upon viewing the small apartment, and observing that prudencio and her three children, in noonan's words, ""had the run of the place.""  48 mass. app. ct. at 362.   nor did prudencio's authority to consent to a search of the family closet stop at the boundary of the suitcase.  in coinhabiting as he did, and leaving his gun unlocked in a closet used by all, the defendant made a ""significant sacrifice of individual privacy"" vis-à-vis prudencio, and ""assumed the risk"" that she would access his belongings (the suitcase) or consent to a search of them.  see bass, 661 f.3d at 1305-1306.neither porter p. nor magri leads to a different result.  it is true that porter p., while it adopts matlock's reasoning,  does state, in footnote 11, that a coinhabitant's consent to search a home would not extend to a suitcase ""that did not belong to the coinhabitant.""  porter p., 456 mass. at 265 n.11.  that statement, however, must be read in the context of the case as a whole.  porter p. on its facts did not involve consent given by a coinhabitant.  moreover, the cases cited in footnote 11 did not involve coinhabitants with ""joint access or control"" over the space searched, such as in matlock, noonan, and bass, but rather involved the different relationship of a homeowner and an occasional guest.we accordingly do not read footnote 11 as broadly rejecting the line ofpage 178cases, cited above, that rely on matlock's rationale to validate searches on facts very similar to those before us.the defendant also relies upon commonwealth v. magri, but in magri the defendant also was not a coinhabitant but an overnight guest, and the court ruled that his host could not consent to a search of belongings he had left at the host's home.  see 462 mass. at 366-367.  while magri cites footnote 11 of porter p., magri's holding depends on the reasoning that an overnight guest (unlike the coinhabitants in the cases cited above) retains an expectation of privacy in his belongings vis-à-vis his host.  id. at 366-368.in short, when the statements from porter p. and magri are considered in context, we do not believe they support the defendant's position.  accordingly, the judge did not err in concluding that the defendant's coinhabitant could and did validly consent to the search of the defendant's closed but unlocked suitcase located in the common closet of their shared bedroom in their home.judgments affirmed.",criminal,Cathleen E.

[182-184]this court concluded that g. l. c. 152, § 25a(2)(c), required that a reinsurer, rather than the workers' compensation trust fund, be responsible for the continued payment of compensation benefits to an employee following the insolvency of the self-insurer and the exhaustion of its surety bond, regardless of the presence of a retention provision in the reinsurance contract. [184-188]","this is an appeal by ace american insurance company (ace), from a decision of the reviewing board (board) of the department of industrial accidents (department).  the board held that ace, rather than the workers' compensation trust fund (trust fund), was responsible for the continued payment of compensation benefits to robert janocha (employee) because g. l. c. 152, § 25a(2)(c), of the workers' compensation act (act), g. l. c. 152, as amended, requires ace as a reinsurerpage 180to pay benefits in the event of exhaustion of a self-insurer's surety bond.  we affirm.factual and procedural background.  all parties agree that there are no material facts in dispute.  the employee worked for malden mills industries, inc. (employer), until the date of his workplace injury.  the employee's injury resulted in permanent and total incapacity for work, and the employee is entitled to benefits under the act.on the date of the employee's injury, the employer was an approved self-insurer pursuant to g. l. c. 152, § 25a(2).  in accordance with § 25a(2)(b), the employer also held a surety bond in the amount of $2.4 millionwith safeco insurance company of america (safeco or bond holder).  in addition, the employer maintained a reinsurance policy with ace in accordance with § 25a(2)(c).the reinsurance policy between the employer and ace contained a retention provision in the amount of $400,000.all terms of the bond and the reinsurance policy were approved by the department in accordance with § 25a(2) during initial approval and after every yearly review.from the employee's date of injury until the employer's bankruptcy in 2007, the employer as the self-insurer issued direct benefit payments to the employee.  following the employer's insolvency, the bond holder issued direct benefit payments to the employee.  in 2012, the $2.4 million bond became exhausted and payments to the employee ceased.on the date of exhaustion, and on the date of oral argument, the employee had not reached the $400,000 retention floor contained within the reinsurancepage 181contract.upon the exhaustion of the bond, the employee filed a claim with the department against ace for resumption of benefits.after a full evidentiary hearing, the administrative judge ruled that once the employer's bond was exhausted, the employer became ""uninsured in violation of [the statute]"" under the provisions of g. l. c. 152, § 65(2)(e), as amended by st. 1991, c. 398, § 85.  the administrative judge concluded that this interpretation of the act made the trust fund the ""responsible party for providing workers' compensation benefits"" and that ace was not required to make payments until the employee's benefits reached the $400,000 retention amount.  the trust fund appealed to the board.the board reversed the administrative judge, interpreting § 65(2)(e) to apply only where an employer is uninsured ""on the date . . . of injury.""  accordingly, the board ordered ace to make direct payments to the employee upon the exhaustion of the bond, and to reimburse the trust fund for any payments it had made that were not covered by reimbursement from safeco.  the board also ruled that § 25a(2)(c) required ace to pay the employee's benefits because in the event of bond exhaustion, the reinsurer must act as a ""of a self-insurer's ability to pay the [employee's] benefits"" (emphasis added).relying on insurance co. of the state of pa. v. great northern ins. co.,, 750 (2016) (great northern), the board also voided the $400,000 retention provision as a matter of law because it is in direct conflict with ace's ""statutory obligation to assure that benefits are received by the employee.""  ace appealed the board's decision to this court pursuant to g. l. c. 152, § 12(2).standard of review.  we review the board's decision in accordance with the standards set forth in g. l. c. 30a, § 14(7)(a)-(d),page 182(f), and (g).  see scheffler's case,, 257-258 (1994).  ""the board, as the agency charged with administering the workers' compensation law, is entitled to substantial deference in its reasonable interpretation of the statute.""  sikorski's case,, 480

payment of benefits under statutorily defined circumstances.  ace contends that nothing in § 65(2)(e), or the act as a whole, supports the board's interpretation that ""uninsured in violation of [the act]"" means uninsured on the date of injury.  after an independent review of the text, structure, and purpose of the act, we agree with the board's interpretation of § 65(2)(e).""[a] statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may be effectuated.""  scheffler's case, 419 mass. at 255, quoting from board of educ. v. assessor of worcester,, 513 (1975).  additionally, the act must be analyzed ""as a whole . . . so that the various portions taken together shall constitute a harmonious and consistent legislative enactment.""  spaniol's case,, 107 (2013), quoting from price v. railway express agency, inc.,, 480 (1948).section 65(2)(e) conditions payment of benefits by the trust fund to a qualifying employee whose employer is ""uninsured in violation of this chapter.""  while the act contains an extensive list of definitions, nothing in the chapter expressly defines the word ""uninsured,"" and § 65(2)(e) does not specifically identify the applicable operative date of the employer's uninsured status.  despite the absence of a definition connecting the employer's uninsured status to the date of the employee's injury, viewing the statute as a whole, it is clear that the date of injury is essential to determining who is eligible to receive benefits as well as who is obligated to pay them.  because § 65(2) is the sole source of the trust fund's obligation to pay workers' compensation benefits,page 183examining the provisions that surround § 65(2)(e) provides clarity as to whether 'uninsured' implicitly means uninsured on the date of injury.  see people for the ethical treatment of animals, inc. v. department of agric. resources,, 287-288 (2017), quoting from kenney v. building commr. of melrose,, 295 (1943) (""a general term in a statute or ordinance takes meaning from the setting in which it is employed"").we begin with § 65(2)(a)-(b).  section 65(2)(a) refers to § 34b and § 65(2)(b) refers to § 35c.  this court has concluded that both of those cross-referenced sections expressly look to the date of workplace injury when considering the insurer or self-insurer's right to reimbursement from the trust fund for benefits paid to employees under these provisions.  see, e.g., beatty's case,, 568 (2013) (""section 34b[c] goes on to narrow the right to reimbursement by the date of injury"").the date of injury is also implicitly important for other cross-referenced provisions in § 65(2).  section 65(2)(c), (f), and (g), by means of § 37, § 26, and § 37a, respectively, authorizes certain reimbursements from the trust fund to the insurer or self-insurer for payments to an employee who has suffered a personal injury ""arising out of and in the course of his employment.""  g. l. c. 152, § 26.  a plain and ordinary reading of the ""arising out of"" condition, which is contained in  § 26, § 37, and § 37a, imparts a meaning that the date of the employee's injury is an essential factor to be considered in determining reimbursements from the trust fund to the insurer or self-insurer.  see pearson's case,, 576-577 (1960) (interpreting ""arising out of"" necessarily requires examining the employee's ""place of employment at the time of . . . injury"").  a contrary interpretation of ""arising out of"" leads to the absurd result that an employee injured outside the course of employment on the date of injury would still be entitled to benefits under the act.  see caswell's case,, 502-503 (1940).here, the relevant surrounding provisions all strongly suggest imparting the temporal restriction into § 65(2)(e).  thus, the board's interpretation that ""uninsured in violation of [the statute]"" means uninsured on the ""date of . . . injury"" is not reading additional language into the text but, instead, constitutes a reasonable interpretation of § 65(2)(e) consistent with § 65(2) and the act as a whole.  see franklin office park realty corp. v. commissioner of the dept. of envtl. protection,, 462 (2013) (""words grouped together in a statute must be read in harmony"").page 184even aside from the express language of the statute, the system of workers' compensation has long been interpreted to rest on the principle that ""[a]n insurer is not responsible unless the period covered by its policy includes the time of the injury.""  crowley's case,, 371 (1934) (quotation omitted).  see brophy's case,, 559 (1951) (""one of the most vital factors in determining to whom and by whom compensation is to be paid under the statute is the date on which the injury occurs"").while an explicit legislative mandate may have been preferred, the structure, history, and purpose of § 65(2)(e) clearly show that ""uninsured"" status must be determined on the date of injury.  to separate ""uninsured"" from the date of injury is inconsistent with the purpose of the statute.  the board's interpretation of g. l. c. 152, § 65(2)(e), which reads ""date of injury"" as an implied term of § 65(2)(e), is necessary to assure that the distribution of benefits from the trust fund will be in harmony with the provisions of § 65(2) and, thus, is entitled to deference.see generally molly a. v. commissioner of the dept. of mental retardation,, 280 (2007).  here, it is undisputed that the employer qualified as a self-insurer on the date of the employee's injury, and therefore was not uninsured on that date, and in fact paid benefits until it went bankrupt some two years later.  therefore, the trust fund has no obligation under § 65(2)(e) to pay compensation benefits to the employee.2.  ace's liability.  having determined that the trust fund is not liable to pay the employee's benefits, we now examine ace's statutory obligation.  ""in order to promote the health, safety andpage 185welfare of employees,"" § 25a of the act, inserted by st. 1943, c. 529, § 7, requires every employer operating within the jurisdiction of massachusetts to obtain workers' compensation insurance in one of two ways:  employers may either purchase insurance, pursuant to § 25a(1), or, as here, they may apply to become self-insurers who pay benefits to injured employees directly, pursuant to § 25a(2).in order to receive or maintain licensure as a self-insurer, the department requires the employer to keep either a bond or surety running to the commonwealth for the benefit and security of the employees in accordance with § 25a(2)(a) or (b).  in addition, § 25a(2)(c) requires the employer acting as a self-insurer to purchase reinsurance in such amount and form as the department may approve.  section 25a(2)(c), which we have set out in the margin (see note 6, supra), forms the background for the reinsurance policy between the employee and ace.section 25a, like every part of the act, must be given an interpretation that protects the rights of employees because the act's exclusivity provision often makes the act the only avenue for financial compensation for the impairment of an injured worker's earning capacity.  see walker's case,, 161 (2004).  the act as a whole ""is a remedial statute and should be given a broad interpretation, viewed in light of its purpose and to 'promote the accomplishment of its beneficent design.'""  neff v. commissioner of the dept. of industrial accs.,, 73 (1995), quoting from young v. duncan,, 349 (1914).  ace argues that despite the beneficent design of the act as a whole, the reinsurance requirement of § 25a(2)(c) was not intended as a protection for the injured employee in the event of the self-insurer's inability to continue paying benefits but, instead, as a protection for the employer from ""extraordinary losses or losses caused by one disaster.""  see note 6, supra.  we disagree.the language of § 25a(2)(c) specifically provides that reinsurance shall further guarantee the self-insured's ability to pay benefits to injured employees.  to the extent the statute is concerned about a self-insurer incurring extraordinary losses, it is in the context of ensuring that a self-insured will continue to be able to pay benefits to injured employees in the event of such losses.  a review of the legislative history of § 25a shows that any argument that the statute is concerned about the success of the self-insurer separate and apart from its ability to pay benefits to injured employees is specious.page 186section 25a was added to g. l. c. 152 in 1943 to require every employer to cover workplace injuries through insurance or self-insurance, replacing an elective system.  see st. 1943, c. 529, § 7.  see also new england survey sys., inc. v. department of industrial accs.,, 635 (2016).  the 1943 legislation also created a reinsurance provision, g. l. c. 152, § 25a(2)(c), which applied to self-insurers in the discretion of the department.  see st. 1943, c. 529, § 7 (""as a further guarantee of a self-insurer's ability to pay the benefits provided for by this chapter to injured employees, the departmentrequire that a self-insurer reinsure his compensation risk against catastrophe"" [emphasis added]).five years later, § 25a(2)(c) was amended to add what is now a second paragraph.  that amendment expressly extended the department's regulatory authority beyond solely the self-insurer to the reinsurer as well.  see st. 1948, c. 176.  the section was again amended in 1949 to add new language to the second paragraph.  the 1949 amendment requires reinsurance proceeds to be used exclusively for the benefit of injured employees by precluding creditors from attaching the reinsurance proceeds,and making the use of ""any money received by a self-insurer . . . subject to the approval of the [department].""  st. 1949, c. 441, § 4.these amendments demonstrate that the legislature's purpose in fashioning the workers' compensation reinsurance provision was the protection of injured employees.  if the primary purpose of § 25a(2)(c) were to protect the employer rather than the employee, the legislature would have permitted creditors to attach reinsurance proceeds like any other corporate asset rather than allow department regulation of reinsurers once an employer becomes insolvent.the 1949 amendment to § 25a(2)(c) additionally made reinsurance mandatory for self-insurers; previously, this had been left to the discretion of the department.  making reinsurance mandatory, instead of merely at the discretion of the department, shows that the phrase ""further guarantee of [the] ability to pay . . . benefits"" in § 25a(2)(c) is controlling because even self-insurerspage 187with a low risk of catastrophic injuries to their workers were required to obtain reinsurance.in sum, the amendments to § 25a(2)(c), which has remained largely unchanged since 1949, demonstrate a clear legislative intent to continually strengthen the reinsurance requirement not for the employer's protection from ""extraordinary losses or losses caused by one disaster,"" but primarily to ""further guarantee [payment of] benefits . . . to injured employees.""reading these amendments in light of the broad public policy to provide compensation for injured workers, we agree with the board's interpretation that the ""further guarantee"" clause of § 25a(2)(c) requires the reinsurer to pay benefits to employees in the event the self-insurer becomes insolvent and the bond becomes exhausted, avoiding an otherwise inevitable gap in coverage.  see new england survey sys., inc., 89 mass. app. ct. at 635 (""the fundamental aim of public policy in the area of workers' compensation is to provide relief to injured workers and their families and remedy the deprivation of wages that results from their injuries"").ace contends that despite this statutory obligation, the insurance policy's retention provision precludes ace's payment of benefits to the employee until the $400,000 amount is reached.  however, a party is unable to contract away its statutory obligation, and we routinely void provisions that run contrary to the law.this is especially true in the instant context because ""[w]orkers' compensation insurance is a creature of statute, and all workers' compensation insurance policies must be interpreted to comply with applicable statutes and regulations governing workers' compensation.""  great northern, 473 mass. at 750.  see frost v. david c. wells ins. agency, inc.,, 307 (1982).  simply put, ace entered into a reinsurance policy between itself and the employer with full knowledge that the act required ace to ""further guarantee"" payment of compensation to the employee.  accordingly, the instant retention provision is null and void, and ace must assume its obligation to pay benefits to the employee under § 25a(2)(c).decision of the reviewing board affirmed.",civil,None,affirm

evidence, videotape, relevancy and materiality.  assault by means of a dangerous weapon.a district court judge abused his discretion in denying a criminal defendant's motion for a new trial based on the commonwealth's failure to preserve and disclose a video surveillance recording of the incident that gave rise to the defendant's conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, i.e., kicking a police officer while he was being transported at the police station in a restraint chair, where, although the commonwealth exhibited no bad faith, it was negligent both in failing to preserve the recording and in failing to fully disclose that it had once existed, and where the defendant suffered both potential prejudice from being deprived of the recording and actual prejudice from being deprived of using the fact that the recording had been destroyed [196-199]; further, in light of its conclusion that the defendant was entitled to a new trial, this court declined to consider whether counsel's failure to learn of the potential existence of a police policy on the use of the restraint chair constituted ineffective assistance [199-200]; finally, this court declined to consider the defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon based on reckless conduct [200-201].","a district court jury convicted the defendant of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (abdw), a shod foot.  the conviction was based on testimony that while the defendant was being transported at the police station in a device known as a ""restraint chair,"" he kicked a lynn police officer in thepage 190stomach.  before us now are the defendant's direct appeal and his appeal of the denial of his motion for new trial (which have been consolidated).  the defendant argues that a new trial is warranted on three grounds:  1) the commonwealth's failure to preserve and disclose a video surveillance recording of the incident, 2) ineffectiveness of trial counsel in failing to request a copy of the lynn police department's policy on the use of restraint chairs, and 3) insufficient evidence to convict the defendant of abdw based on reckless conduct, one of the two theories on which the case went to the jury.  for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.  we therefore vacate the judgment and set aside the verdict.background.  1.  the incident.  at approximately 9:30 p.m. on august 24, 2012, lynn police officers responded to reports of a disturbance outside a bar in lynn.  there, the police found the defendant in the aftermath of what appeared to be a bicycle accident.  he was yelling at others at the scene, unsteady on his feet, smelled of alcohol, and had slurred speech.concluding that the defendant was intoxicated, the officers placed him into protective custody, handcuffed his hands behind his back, and transported him to the police station in the back of their cruiser.  once at the station garage, the defendant was unwilling or unable to exit the cruiser.the officers therefore pulled him out of the vehicle, and placed him on the ground after he could not, or would not, stand.at that point, the officers radioed their supervisors inside the station for assistance, and they were brought a restraint chair to transport the defendant to the booking area.  a restraint chair is designed to immobilize unruly detainees.  it has a seat that is tilted so that when the chair itself otherwise is upright, the person sitting there is lying back at an angle with his knees elevated above his hips.  the chair has straps to be used to hold in place a detainee's wrists, ankles, lap and shoulders.  in this instance,page 191however, the officers did not use the available straps to secure the defendant in the restraint chair.  instead, after placing him in the chair with his hands handcuffed behind his back, they left him that way for the trip into the station.  according to the defendant, who testified at trial, this meant that his entire weight fell on his handcuffed wrists, causing him ""excruciating pain.""he further testified that this in turn caused him to writhe around in the chair as he sought to relieve the pressure off his wrists.  without the defendant strapped in, the police held him down in the chair using their hands, causing further pressure on his handcuffed wrists.the failure of the police to secure the defendant in the restraint chair appears to be at odds with a written policy that emerged only in postconviction discovery.  that policy set forth various procedures and requires ""that all [police] personnel adhere strictly to [its] procedures.""  the policy also requires that after initially placing a detainee in the restraint chair, ""[t]he attached recommended manufacturer procedures for properly restraining a detainee in the [chair] should then be followed.""  under those procedures, the police are to attach the detainee's handcuffs to the supplied ""handcuff tether,"" and then release the defendant's arms one at a time to attach them to the arm of the chair using a wrist wrap.at least at one point during the trip from the garage to the booking area, the defendant's foot -- which the officers had not secured using the chair's straps and which, according to a police witness, was hanging off the side of the chair -- impeded the movement of the chair.  the officers portrayed this as a deliberate effort by the defendant to thwart his being taken into the station house; the defendant portrayed it as the involuntary result of his trying to relieve the pressure on his handcuffed wrists.  in either event, it is uncontested that the police officers tilted the restraint chair back in order to keep the chair moving, with one of the officers acknowledging that the chair was ""tilted back further than it already is designed to do.""  the tilting of the chair in this manner also appears to violate the police policy on the use of restraint chairs, which mandates that ""[t]he [restraint chair] and detainee shall remain in a seated upright position at all times while a detainee is restrained in the [chair], and should at no time be positioned backward so that the detainee is positioned on their back.""page 192the defendant described the tilting of the chair as a sudden jerking that caused him to flail in it.  he admitted that his foot came into contact with one of the officers, but he characterized it as an accidental ""knee-jerk reaction"" to the sudden tilting of the chair.  the officers described it as a distinct and deliberate kick to the officer's stomach.  the officer who was struck described the kick as having been done with ""quite a bit of force,"" and he testified that it ""hurt.""the trial judge instructed the jury on the elements of abdw (and of assault and battery as a lesser included offense) based on both intentional and reckless conduct.  in addition, at the defendant's request, the judge instructed the jury on accident.  neither party objected.2.  surveillance recordings and pretrial discovery.unbeknownst to the defendant prior to trial, the police station was outfitted with closed circuit surveillance cameras in all of the areas through which the defendant was transported in the restraint chair.  moreover, video recordings of what transpired there automatically would have been made.  however, the system was set up so that, on a ten-week cycle, recordings are automatically recorded over.  as a result, video recordings not retrieved within that ten-week period effectively are destroyed.there is a paper trail that memorializes some of the pretrial communications between the prosecutor and defense counsel, and between the prosecutor and lynn police, regarding whether there might be a video recording of the incident.  on february 10, 2014, almost a year-and-a-half after the incident, the defendant filed an assented-to motion for discovery that, inter alia, specifically sought any ""surveillance video recordings showing the defendant being moved from any parking lot [or] garage to the booking area of lynn [p]olice [d]epartment on august 24, 2012[,] at approximately 9:30 [p.m.]""that same day, the prosecutor asked the police department for ""[v]ideotape or [p]hotograph(s) related to [the] case.""  on may 27, 2014, the prosecutor again made a request of the department, this time requesting ""[s]urveillance video"" and specifically inquiring whether there was ""[a]ny [b]ooking video of [the] incident[.]""  the police responded to the second request:  ""[n]otpage 193available.""  that same day, the prosecutor filed a certificate of compliance certifying that the commonwealth had satisfied its mandatory discovery obligations pursuant to mass.r.crim.p. 14, as amended,  444 mass. 1501  (2005).  in that document, the prosecutor specifically certified that she had provided ""[a]ny facts of an exculpatory nature"" and ""[a]ll other material and relevant evidence, [including] . . . photographs [and] tangible objects.""beyond what that paper trail revealed, there ended up being a factual dispute as to what the prosecutor may have told defense counsel orally about whether video recordings ever had been made.  the scope and resolution of that dispute are discussed further below.3.  video recording issues at trial.  the trial was brief, with only three witnesses:  two police officers and the defendant.  during cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the first police witness about the manner in which the officers had requested assistance once the defendant was out of the car and on the ground.  in this vein, counsel asked whether those to whom the witness had radioed for assistance ""[could] see [the witness] from where they[] [were] at[.]""  the witness answered, ""there are cameras, so they -- you know, when we ask them to come in, they could put it up on a monitor, but they're in the [commanding officer's] office.""  this prompted defense counsel to ask:  ""so there [are] camera[]s right there recording?""  after the witness confirmed this, defense counsel turned to other topics for questioning.  before completing her cross-examination, counsel returned to the camera issue only evanescently, soliciting testimony that confirmed that there were cameras all along the way from the garage to the booking area.  there was no testimony elicited about whether any recordings were ever viewed or whether they still existed.before the commonwealth began its redirect examination, both counsel requested to be heard at sidebar.  although the transcript reveals that this discussion went on for at least several minutes, only fragments of what was said were decipherable when the transcript was produced.  from those fragments, we can discern that the defendant asserted that the prosecutor had told her that no video recordings ever had been made and that it was only now that she was learning otherwise.  at one point, the judge's comments appear to suggest that he believed the defendant had waived claims of any discovery violations by not raising the issue prior to trial.  what is missing from the transcript'spage 194memorialization of the sidebar interchanges remains profound.  most significantly, the specific relief that the defendant was requesting at that time is not at all apparent.in any event, after the sidebar discussion concluded, the judge invited the commonwealth to continue with redirect examination.  after the testimony of that witness concluded, the commonwealth called its remaining witness, the police officer who had been struck.  on direct examination, the commonwealth asked no questions about the recordings, and the defendant pursued no cross-examination of that witness whatsoever.at the close of the commonwealth's case, and at her client's specific urging, defense counsel again raised the commonwealth's failure to disclose the prior existence of the video recordings.  this time, we know the specific relief that the defendant was requesting:  a mistrial.  the judge denied the request based on the reasoning he expressed earlier at sidebar (which turned out to be indecipherable on appeal).  addressing the defendant directly, the judge also stated, ""your attorney very intelligently preserved all of your rights on the issue.""4.  ruling on motion for new trial.  the defendant filed a motion for a new trial that was based primarily on the commonwealth's failure to preserve and disclose the video recording of the incident.  in the affidavit that she submitted in support of that motion, defense counsel averred that, in a conversation that transpired on a particular occasion prior to trial, the prosecutor specifically told her that ""the booking area [was] not recorded.""  the prosecutor countered in her own affidavit that she never would have said this because she long had known that the booking area at the lynn police station was video recorded, with the recordings available for only a limited period of time.  she further averred that while she had no specific recollection of the conversation that she had with defense counsel, in accordance with her longstanding practice, she would have passed along exactly what the police officer had told her; namely, that a recording was ""not available.""despite the direct conflict between the affidavits as to what the prosecutor had communicated to defense counsel orally and the judge's willingness to hold an evidentiary hearing, the parties jointly foreswore that opportunity.  instead, they presented thepage 195judge with a stipulation of facts, their dueling affidavits, and a copy of the restraint chair policy.  in addition, the commonwealth appropriately made significant concessions during argument on the motion.  for example, the commonwealth acknowledged that the lynn police had informed her that based on the placement of the video cameras, the cameras ""would have captured the incident"" for which the defendant was convicted.  in addition, citing to commonwealth v. heath,(2016) (kafker, c.j.), the commonwealth acknowledged that it was negligent in failing to preserve and produce the video recording.despite its concessions, the commonwealth argued that a new trial nevertheless was not warranted.  although the commonwealth downplayed the materiality of the missing video recording, it focused mainly on its argument that the defendant had not shown adequate prejudice.  in this regard, the commonwealth contended that because defense counsel learned about the prior existence of the video recordings during trial, she had an opportunity to cross-examine the police witnesses about this, to argue the point in closing argument, and to request an appropriate jury instruction regarding the destruction of the video recording.  in this manner, the commonwealth maintained that it should not be held responsible for counsel's failure to pursue such remedies.in assessing the commonwealth's degree of culpability, the judge credited the prosecutor's affidavit that she would have told defense counsel that a video recording was ""not available,"" not defense counsel's version that the prosecutor had stated that no such recording ever existed.  based on his knowledge of the prosecutor, who frequently appeared before him, the judge found no bad faith in her conduct.  however, consistent with heath, the judge ruled that the commonwealth's failure to preserve and produce the video recording was negligent.  the judge also concluded that ""the defendant here has demonstrated the materiality of the evidence.""nevertheless, the judge accepted the commonwealth's arguments on prejudice.  while noting that the facts here were similar to heath, supra at 339 (in which a new trial was ordered), the judge distinguished that case on the grounds that, there, the defendant had requested and was denied an instruction on what inferences the jury could draw from the destruction of the video recording.  see id. at 330.  here, by contrast, the defendant hadpage 196made no such request,nor otherwise had sought to make use of the recording's destruction (i.e., through cross-examination or argument).the judge reasoned that ""if a new trial were allowed, the defendant would be entitled only to those same remedies he could have had but did not seek at trial.""  with the defendant having passed over such remedies at trial, the judge concluded that the defendant suffered no prejudice.  the defendant's only potentially available posttrial recourse, the judge suggested, would have been a claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to press the issue of the destroyed recording (an argument that the defendant has declined to pursue).as noted, the existence and content of the lynn police department's policy on the use of restraint chairs emerged only in postconviction discovery.  in pressing for a new trial, the defendant also had argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request that policy prior to trial.the judge rejected that claim.  he reasoned that, even without that policy, defense counsel was able to make an issue out of the manner in which the police had used the chair, and that the policy itself would have added little force to that argument.discussion.  1.  failure to preserve and disclose video recording.  as the parties recognize, the underlying facts in the case before us are quite similar to those at issue in heath.  both cases involve an assault and battery on a police officer that occurred at a police station in an area where it would have been recorded, but the recording was not preserved.  in heath, we held that becausepage 197the recording could have provided support for the defendant's claim that he never struck the officer, the defendant had satisfied his ""initial burden to establish by means of 'concrete evidence' that the destroyed evidence was exculpatory.""  89 mass. app. ct. at 334, quoting from commonwealth v. neal,, 12 (1984).  we then considered ""the judge's application of the balancing test that 'weigh[s] the culpability of the commonwealth, the materiality of the evidence, and the potential prejudice to the defendant.'""  id. at 335, quoting from commonwealth v. williams,, 716 (2010).  we concluded that, contrary to the trial judge's assessment, the commonwealth was negligent because ""the police department had a video recording of [the] alleged crime committed in its booking area, with which the defendant was charged [and] the commonwealth should have required no further notification by the defendant to recognize the need to preserve that video evidence.""  id. at 336.  we also concluded that the video plainly was material (an issue the judge did not reach).  id. at 338.  finally, we concluded that the judge erred in ruling that the defendant suffered no substantial prejudice from the judge's refusal to instruct the jury regarding the missing evidence and from the prosecutor's being allowed to argue that the jury should not speculate as to what the recording would have shown.  id. at 337-340.  accordingly, with all three considerations supporting the defendant's position, we ordered that he be granted a new trial.  id. at 339-340.as noted, the judge in the case presently before us distinguished heath on the ground that the defendant there had pressed the issue at trial.  however, a close examination of the differences between the this case and heath reveals that, if anything, the defendant here has a stronger case for a new trial.having been informed prior to trial that such a key piece of evidence had not been preserved, see id. at 330 n.4, defense counsel in heath unsurprisingly was prepared to try to take advantage of the commonwealth's negligence in failing to do so.  here, by contrast, defense counsel was unaware that the recording once had existed until the midst of a very brief trial.  moreover, unlike in heath, the jury here never learned that the police had allowed the recording to be destroyed.to be sure, counsel arguably bears some responsibility for her late appreciation that the tape once had existed.  that is, a more perspicacious attorney might have sensed the ambiguity inherent in the prosecutor's terse response that a recording was ""notpage 198available,"" and therefore done more prior to trial to inquire whether the incident had been recorded and, if so, why any such recording was not available.  however, while we accept the judge's finding that the prosecutor did not act in bad faith, it remains uncontroverted that -- despite the prosecutor's having been aware that a video recording of the booking area once would have existed -- she never overtly called this to the defendant's attention prior to trial.where the prosecutor failed to disclose that a recording had been made, the commonwealth is not in a position to blame defense counsel for misconstruing the equivocal and incomplete discovery response that the commonwealth provided.with respect to defense counsel's conduct at trial, the commonwealth no doubt is correct that some highly competent trial attorneys might have been able, on the spot, to appreciate that the testimony about the cameras meant that a recording of the incident once had existed and -- based on the discovery response that a recording was ""not available"" -- could have surmised that the recording in the interim had not been preserved.  then, armed with this knowledge, perhaps such counsel instantly might have been able to make effective use of this fact through cross-examination and argument, and by requesting a jury instruction on destroyed evidence.however, focusing on what a particularly able trial counsel might have accomplished fails to account for the predicament that the commonwealth's incomplete disclosure caused here.  as justice kaplan once observed in a case involving a broadly similar midtrial disclosure, ""[t]he prosecutor's late, piecemeal, and incomplete disclosures forced on defense counsel the necessity of making difficult tactical decisions quickly in the heat of trial.""  commonwealth v. ellison,, 25 (1978).  even though ""[i]n retrospect, it may be thought that [defense] counsel did not use to maximum advantage those parts of the story he did finally secure out of the prosecutor's possession[,] . . . [a] defendant should not be held to a strict standard in order to patch over the prosecution's conduct.""  id. at 26-27.page 199while it is true that ""[a] defendant assuredly has the burden of showing prejudicial consequences when seeking relief from disclosure delays by the commonwealth[,] . . . [w]e should not expect even the criminal defense adept to accommodate instantly to surprise [evidence] at the moment of trial and to rely entirely on improvised cross-examination in order to counter such possibly [critical] evidence.""  commonwealth v. fossa,, 568 (1996).with these observations in place, we turn to the balancing test recognized in commonwealth v. williams, 455 mass. at 716.  while the commonwealth exhibited no bad faith, nevertheless it was negligent both in failing to preserve the recording and in failing fully to disclose that the recording had once existed.  in addition, the materiality of the missing recording plainly was established, as the judge recognized.  finally, in light of our analysis of defense counsel's conduct at trial, the defendant suffered both potential prejudice from being deprived of the recording and actual prejudice from being deprived of using the fact that the recording had been destroyed.  here, as in heath, the defendant has shown that application of the williams factors support his claim for a new trial.  we therefore conclude that the judge abused his discretion in denying the defendant's motion for new trial.2.  ineffectiveness of counsel.  we need not resolve whether the defendant independently might be entitled to a new trial based on his argument that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to learn of the mandatory policy on the use of restraint chairs.  therefore, we do not decide whether -- in circumstances where a defendant's entire defense was based on allegations that police misused a particular piece of equipment -- the potential existence of a police policy on the use of such equipment presents an obvious area of inquiry.  we do, however, note our disagreement with the judge's assessment that disclosure of the restraint chair policy could have added only marginal value to that defense.  it is one thing for a jury to hear a defendant's complaints about police conduct, and quite another for them to learn that the complained-of conduct might well have violated a mandatory, writtenpage 200policy governing such conduct.3.  sufficiency of evidence of reckless assault and battery.  the commonwealth presented its abdw case primarily based on the theory that the defendant intended to kick the officer with his sneaker.  nevertheless, the jury were also instructed on abdw based on reckless conduct.  to sustain a conviction on the latter theory, the commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant intentionally committed ""a wanton or reckless act (something more than gross negligence) causing physical or bodily injury to another"" by means of a dangerous weapon.  commonwealth v. burno,, 625 (1986).as the defendant accurately points out, there was no evidence that the kick broke any skin or caused any bruising or other manifestations of physical harm.  nor was there any evidence that the kick necessitated any medical treatment.  based on this, the defendant argues that there was no proof that the victim suffered ""physical or bodily injury,"" and, hence, there was insufficient evidence to support an abdw based on reckless conduct.  in turn, the defendant argues that because the evidence necessary to support a reckless abdw was absent and the case went to the jury on both theories, he is entitled to a new trial.  see commonwealth v. green,, 781 (1995) (""the possibility that the verdicts were based on theories for which the commonwealth failed to offer sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt necessitates our setting them aside"").  but see commonwealth v. mistretta,, 907 (2013), quoting from commonwealth v. santos,, 288 (2003) (specific unanimity instruction not required where defendant is charged with intentional and reckless assault and battery, because these are ""closely related subcategories of the same crime"" that ""are not 'separate, distinct, and essentially unrelated ways in which the same crime can be committed'"").in the end, for at least two reasons, we need not reach the defendant's ""two theories"" argument in this appeal.  first, thepage 201defendant waived such an argument by not raising it before the case went to the jury.  see commonwealth v. berry,, 331 (2000) (""[w]hen the defendant submits a generally expressed motion for a required finding of not guilty of [an offense that can be based on multiple theories], the case may be submitted to the jury as long as one theory is supported by the evidence"").  second, the defendant raised his claim that the evidence of a reckless abdw was insufficient only to support the vacating of his conviction, relief we have granted on other grounds.judgment vacated.verdict set aside.order denying motion for new trial reversed.",criminal,James D.

1645,maria martinez  vs.  frances martinez-cintron.,"grandparent.  minor, visitation rights.  interference with parental rights.  parent and child, interference with parental rights.  practice, civil, complaint, affidavit, motion to dismiss.a probate and family court judge erred in denying a mother's motion to dismiss her child's paternal grandmother's petition for grandparent visitation brought pursuant to g. l. c. 119, § 39d, where the grandmother's petition failed to meet the requirements articulated in blixt v. blixt,(2002), of a detailed and verified pleading that, in the absence of a significant preexisting relationship between the grandparent and child, demonstrated that visitation was necessary to protect the child from significant harm. [204-206]","in this interlocutory appeal from the order denying frances martinez-cintron's (mother's) motion to dismiss her child's paternal grandmother's petition for grandparent visitation, we are faced with the question whether blixt v. blixt,(2002), requires a judge to dismiss an inadequate petition for grandparent visitation pursuant to g. l. c. 119, § 39d.  we conclude that it does and therefore reverse the order.background.  we briefly summarize the facts found by the judge.  the mother and james taylor-martinez (father) were divorced in december, 2016, pursuant to a judgment of divorce nisi, when their lone child was approximately six months old.  the mother was awarded sole legal and physical custody of their child, and the father had supervised visitation.  shortly after the divorce nisi, the child's paternal grandmother, maria martinezpage 203(grandmother), filed in the probate and family court a petition for grandparent visitation supported by a handwritten affidavit.  on that petition, the grandmother checked the box that indicates that she is not alleging that there is ""a significant relationship between the grandparent(s) and the child(ren) but that nonetheless it is in the best interest of the minor child(ren) that petitioner(s) be granted visitation with the child(ren).""  her accompanying affidavit did not provide any support for the proposition that it would be in the child's best interest that she be granted visitation rights.  instead, the grandmother's affidavit merely states that she is the child's grandmother, that she and the father have only seen the child in the hospital after he was born, that she wants to ""be able to see him on a weekly basis,"" and that the mother will not let her and the father see the child.the mother initially did not oppose the grandmother's petition, stating that she (the mother) would allow the grandmother to visit the child so long as the visits took place in winchendon, where the mother resides.  after obtaining counsel, however, the mother moved for leave to file an amended answer and subsequently moved to dismiss the grandmother's petition pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6),  365 mass. 754  (1974).  in denying the mother's motion to dismiss, the judge relied on the following passage from blixt, 437 mass. at 666:""[b]efore a parent or parents are called upon to litigate fully a grandparent visitation complaint, with all the attendant stress and expense, the grandparent or grandparentsmake an initial showing that satisfies a judge that the burden of proof, set forth above, can be met.  to this end, any complaint filed under the statutedetailed and verified or be accompanied by a detailed and verified affidavit setting out the factual basis relied on by the plaintiffs to justify relief.  a complaint not so verified, or one accompanied by an inadequate affidavit,to dismissal (or summary judgment) on motion by the defendant or defendants.""  (emphasis supplied by the judge.)this passage, the judge reasoned, indicates that blixt subjects the grandmother's inadequate petition to dismissal, but does not require it, and the judge, quoting blixt, supra at 665 n.24, therefore allowed the grandmother ""the opportunity to produce evidence that circumstances are severe enough to warrant a court's reviewpage 204of the parent's decision to deny visitation.""  the judge made further note of the mother's apparent willingness to maintain contact with the father's family, citing her original answer to the petition and her openness to the father's grandmother serving as one of the supervisors of the father's visitation.the mother petitioned for interlocutory relief in this court pursuant to g. l. c. 231, § 118, seeking review of the order denying her motion to dismiss.  a single justice of this court ordered the judge to issue written findings and conclusions, yet lacked the authority to order the relief requested upon receipt of those written findings and conclusions.  see mass.r.a.p. 15(c),  365 mass. 859  (1974).  instead, the single justice granted the mother leave to file an interlocutory appeal.the question before us now is, in light of blixt, whether a judge must allow a parent's motion to dismiss a grandparent's petition for visitation when the petition does not sufficiently allege why visitation is necessary to protect the child from significant harm.  we conclude that blixt does impose such a requirement, and consequently reverse the order denying the motion to dismiss and order the petition dismissed.discussion.  we review the order de novo.  curtis v. herb chambers i-95, inc.,, 676 (2011).  to survive a rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a pleading must include ""factual 'allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)' an entitlement to relief.""  iannacchino v. ford motor co.,, 636 (2008), quoting from bell atl. corp. v. twombly, 550 u.s. 544, 557 (2007).  allegations, therefore, ""must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.""  id. at 555.the blixt court laid out the pleading requirements for a grandparent seeking visitation under g. l. c. 119, § 39d.  emphasizing the presumption that parents act in the best interest of their children, the court stated that grandparents must rebut that presumption by establishing that denying visitation is contrary to thepage 205best interest of the child.  blixt, 437 mass. at 658.  ""more specifically, to succeed, the grandparents must allege and prove that the failure to grant visitation will cause the child significant harm by adversely affecting the child's health, safety, or welfare.""  ibid.  in situations like the one before us where a grandparent does not assert ""a significant preexisting relationship"" with the grandchild, ""the grandparent must prove that visitation between grandparent and child is nevertheless necessary to protect the child from significant harm.""  ibid.we have already addressed the heightened pleading standard imposed by blixt in sher v. desmond,(2007), a case decided prior to iannacchino.  in sher, supra at 278-279, we noted that blixt placed a higher burden on a grandparent seeking visitation than was required under the then-existing notice pleading standard.  accordingly, to survive a rule 12(b)(6) motion, a blixt affidavit must contain ""averments of significant harm that are (1) facially sufficient to rebut the presumption of parental fitness; (2) based on information and belief; and (3) made with particularity and indicating the source of the information.""  sher, supra at 281.we now take the opportunity to reemphasize the pleading requirements under blixt, particularly with the benefit of guidance from iannacchino.  in the present case, the judge erred in her interpretation of blixt, and we conclude that blixt, when read in conjunction with the rule 12(b)(6) standard, required the judge to allow the mother's motion to dismiss.  while we are sympathetic to the grandmother's efforts to establish a relationship with her grandchild, we are similarly mindful that, absent a showing to the contrary, we presume a fit parent will act in her child's best interest.  ""the liberty interest at issue in this case -- the interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children -- is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this court.""  troxel v. granville, 530 u.s. 57, 65 (2000).  see adoption of vito,, 562-563 (2000); blixt, supra; adoption of ilona,, 64-65 (2011).  with that presumption in mind, we further emphasize the need to protect parents from unnecessary litigation and ""all the attendant stress and expense"" that comes with it.  blixt, supra at 666.  without proper cause, a parent's ability to make choices for her children is not to be intruded on.we consider the pleading requirements presented in blixt to be clear:  ""any complaint filed under the statute should be detailedpage 206and verified or be accompanied by a detailed and verified affidavit setting out the factual basis relied on by the plaintiffs to justify relief.""  ibid.  in denying the motion to dismiss, the judge noted that ""the court is unable to determine with certainty that the grandmother is entitled to no relief under any state of facts which could be proved in support of the claim.""  while we understand the judge's emphasis on the court's use in blixt of the word ""should,"" which has long been recognized to mean recommended rather than mandatory, we consider her decision to be in conflict with the directive of blixt.  see willitts v. roman catholic archbishop of boston,, 207 (1991) (""the word 'should' . . . is merely advisory rather than mandatory language"").  absent some extreme circumstance, the proper consideration is whether the grandmother made adequate factual allegations to plausibly suggest, beyond mere speculation, ""that visitation between grandparent and child is . . . necessary to protect the child from significant harm.""  blixt, supra at 658.  the grandmother's affidavit in no way indicated that a failure to order visitation would subject the child to any harm, much less significant harm.conclusion.  the order denying the mother's motion to dismiss is reversed, and the petition shall be dismissed, with prejudice.so ordered.",civil,Leilah A.

[215]","the parties submitted a construction dispute, pending in litigation in the superior court, to arbitration under the uniform arbitration act, g. l. c. 251, §§ 1 et seq.  the arbitrator issued a substantial award in favor of the plaintiff, central ceilings, inc., but purported to reserve the calculation of preawardpage 208interest to a superior court judge.  the parties did not agree to this reservation.  on the plaintiff's motion to confirm the arbitration award, the judge (remanding judge) remanded the matter to the arbitrator for the calculation of preaward interest.  after the arbitrator awarded preaward interest well below that requested by the plaintiff, the plaintiff moved to correct or to vacate that award.  the plaintiff now appeals from the order denying that motion.  concluding that an arbitrator may not reserve the calculation of preaward interest for a judge without the agreement of the parties, and finding no error in the failure to award attorney's fees, we affirm.1.  background.  the plaintiff was a subcontractor to defendant suffolk construction company, inc. (suffolk), the general contractor, in a project for the renovation and construction converting the old charles street jail in boston into the liberty hotel.on january 31, 2008, the plaintiff commenced an action in superior court against the defendants, raising various claims arising out of its subcontract with suffolk.  after discovery and pretrial proceedings, the parties filed a joint motion to stay the case in favor of resolving the dispute through arbitration.  on october 8, 2013, the parties entered into an arbitration agreement governed by the uniform arbitration act, g. l. c. 251, §§ 1 et seq., expressly incorporating the construction industry arbitration rules of the american arbitration association.  the arbitration agreement reached ""all relevant issues appertaining"" to the civil lawsuit and granted the arbitrator ""full power and authority to award money damages and to grant such other relief, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and any other contractually authorized damages as he, in his sole discretion, shall deem just and proper"" ""[t]o the same extent as if he were a justice of the massachusetts superior court.""  a judge allowed the motion and stayed the case during the pendency of the arbitration.after extensive arbitration proceedings, the arbitrator issued an initial award on the merits in favor of the plaintiff in a decision dated february 20, 2015, in the amount of $1,324,819.24, ""with interest thereon in the amount ultimately assessed by the court,"" plus attorney's fees and costs as set out in the subcontract betweenpage 209the parties.the parties filed timely cross motions with the arbitrator requesting modification, correction, and clarification of the initial award.  the arbitrator denied the defendants' motion and allowed the plaintiff's motion.  the modified award, dated april 6, 2015, changed the award only to require an additional interest calculation.  it continued to reserve the task of calculating interest on the $1,324,819.24 award to a judge, but also required that judge to calculate interest on a payment of $402,852 already made by suffolk shortly after the parties agreed to arbitration and prior to any award.on april 15, 2015, the defendants moved in superior court to vacate the arbitrator's award.  the defendants soon reconsidered, paid the modified award plus postaward interest on june 24, 2015, and then withdrew their motion to vacate.  meanwhile, the parties were unable to agree on the attorney's fees and costs owed to the plaintiff.  the arbitrator awarded attorney's fees and costs on july 20, 2015, which suffolk paid within one month.

	the parties, however, continued to dispute the issue of preaward (as opposed to postaward) interest, as neither the initial nor the modified award expressly stated that the interest to be calculated by a judge included preaward interest.  the plaintiff maintained that the arbitrator either explicitly or implicitly awarded preaward interest from the commencement of the suit at the statutory rate of twelve percent, see g. l. c. 231, § 6c, and that the judge had the duty to calculate that interest.  the defendants, in turn, asserted that only the arbitrator could calculate preaward interest.on october 26, 2015, the plaintiff moved to confirm the modified award under g. l. c. 251, §§ 11, 14, 15, and to enter judgment against the defendants for the disputed preaward interest in the amount of $1,563,763.58 plus an additional $500.46 for every day after september 16 to the date of judgment.  the defendants, conversely, asserted that the preaward interest had been submitted to the arbitrator and thus no additional preaward recovery was permissible.after a hearing, the remanding judge concluded that, although the arbitrator implicitly awarded preaward interest, the lack of any explicit agreement between the parties on the issue precluded its reservation for a judge.  accordingly, the remanding judgepage 210remanded the matter to the arbitrator pursuant to g. l. c. 251, §§ 9, 13, for the calculation of preaward interest.on remand, the arbitrator explained that he had ""mistakenly believed"" that he lacked the authority to calculate the preaward interest.  the arbitrator acceded to the remanding judge's order and issued a postremand clarification dated august 9, 2016.  the arbitrator awarded the plaintiff $287,036 in preaward interest, declining to adopt the statutory interest rate under g. l. c. 231, § 6c.  citing his broad discretion on the matter, the arbitrator instead considered ""various factors"" of the underlying dispute to award a ""fair and equitable"" amount based on the ""totality of circumstances.""  suffolk promptly paid that amount.in response, on september 26, 2016, the plaintiff moved under g. l. c. 251, §§ 12, 13, to ""correct"" the arbitrator's postremand award to $1,462,600, based on the twelve percent interest rate in g. l. c. 231, § 6c, and additionally to award the plaintiff supplemental attorney's fees and costs for the postarbitration court proceedings.  the defendants opposed the motion, contending that (1) the plaintiff's motion was untimely; (2) the arbitrator did not exceed his authority; and (3) the plaintiff was not entitled to further attorney's fees and costs because the defendants were the ""prevailing party"" in the postremand litigation.  a third superior court judge denied the plaintiff's motion, citing the reasons set forth in the defendants' opposition.2.  remand to the arbitrator to calculate preaward interest.  we review de novo a judge's decision on a motion to confirm an arbitration award under g. l. c. 251, § 11, bolman v. plymouth rock assur. corp., 82 mass. app. ct. 135, 142 (2012), recognizing ""that 'the entitlement of a party to preaward interest is a decision that is within the purview of the arbitrator[].'""  id. at 139, quoting from connecticut valley sanitary waste disposal, inc. v. zielinski,, 271 (2002).

(2) the award was imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy; or (3) for the purpose of clarifying the award.g. l. c. 251, §§ 9, 13.  baxter health care, corp. v. harvard apparatus, inc.,, 209 (1993).  here, because the award improperly directed the judge to calculate preaward interest without the requisite agreement of the parties, it was imperfect as a matter of form, in a manner outside the merits of the underlying dispute.g. l. c. 251, § 13(a)(3).  accordingly, the issue of preaward interest was properly remanded to the arbitrator for calculation.  see baxter health care, corp., supra at 210 (resubmission to arbitrator under § 9 ""ispage 213within the discretion of the court, and may be upon such conditions as the court orders"").it follows from the preceding conclusion that the plaintiff's motion to ""correct"" the arbitrator's postremand award was properly denied.  the plaintiff's motion essentially asked the judge to disregard the arbitrator's postremand decision and to calculate the postaward interest himself.  because, however, the remanding judge properly had remanded the matter to the arbitrator, the third judge also properly rejected this motion.  see bolman, 82 mass. app. ct. at 141.  see also bruner and o'connor on construction law § 21:215 (2014) (courts generally reluctant to correct awards imperfect in matter of form when doing so would change the amount awarded).3.  motion in the alternative to vacate the arbitrator's postremand award.  we uphold an arbitration award even if the arbitrator's findings and conclusions ""appear erroneous, inconsistent, or unsupported by the record at the arbitration hearing.""  katz, nannis & solomon, p.c., 473 mass. at 790, quoting from lynn v. thompson,, 61 (2001), cert. denied, 534 u.s. 1131 (2002).

[218-221]in consolidated civil actions challenging a mortgage foreclosure, there was no merit to the plaintiff's claim that a preforeclosure right to cure notice sent by the mortgagee's predecessor did not strictly comply with the terms of her mortgage; accordingly, the superior court judge properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on that ground. [221-222]in consolidated civil actions challenging a mortgage foreclosure, the superior court judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants (the mortgagee and its servicer) with respect to the plaintiff's claim that the foreclosure was invalid because a preforeclosure right to cure notice sent by the mortgagee's predecessor was not authorized by the note holder, where the mortgagee failed to provide competent evidence that the predecessor acted as the mortgagee's agent in sending the notice. [222-224]","in november, 2009, green tree servicing, llc (green tree), foreclosed on henrietta eaton's home, exercising the power of sale contained in her mortgage.  green tree, acting as servicer for federal national mortgage association (fannie mae), offered the highest bid at the auction.  as green tree's assignee, fannie mae purchased the property and then brought an eviction action in housing court.  on the theory that the foreclosure was void because green tree did not hold the mortgage note at the time of the foreclosure sale, eaton brought her own declaratory judgment action in superior court and obtained a preliminary injunction against the eviction, an injunction which resulted in the supreme judicial court's oft-cited opinion in eaton v. federal natl. mort. assn.,(2012) (eaton i).after the remand in eaton i, the housing court matter was transferred to the superior court and the two cases were consolidated.  in september, 2016, on cross motions for summary judgment, a superior court judge entered judgment for fannie mae and green tree in the consolidated cases.eaton now appeals, making three arguments.  first, she claims a genuine issue of fact exists regarding the physical possession of her promissory note at the time of the foreclosure.  second, she asserts that a preforeclosure right to cure notice sent by fannie mae's predecessor, bankunited, fsb (bankunited), did not strictly comply with the terms of her mortgage, as required by pinti v. emigrantpage 218mort. co.,(2015).third, eaton contends that a question of fact exists as to bankunited's authority to send the right to cure notice.  we vacate the judgment on the narrow issue of bankunited's authority to send the right to cure notice, and affirm the judgment in all other respects, albeit on somewhat different grounds.background.  the general background of the case is set forth in eaton i, which, as we have noted, considered the grant of a preliminary injunction.  we recite the facts from the summary judgment record, reserving certain additional facts for later discussion.eaton signed the original note payable to bankunited on september 12, 2007.  on or about october 1, 2007, fannie mae purchased a pool of loans from bankunited, including eaton's loan.  eaton defaulted, and bankunited sent her a right to cure notice dated november 14, 2008.  in november of 2009, green tree, which had been made fannie mae's servicer, conducted the foreclosure auction that resulted in this litigation.discussion.  our review of the allowance of summary judgment is de novo, ""because we examine the same record and decide the same questions of law"" as the motion judge.  kiribati seafood co., llc v. dechert llp,, 116 (2017).  and, given that ""both parties have moved for summary judgment, [we view] the evidence . . . in the light most favorable to the party against whom judgment is to enter.""  albahari v. zoning bd. of appeals of brewster,, 248 n.4 (2010).1.  physical possession of the note at the time of foreclosure.  in eaton's view, fannie mae must demonstrate that there is no dispute of fact that it had physical possession of the note at the time of the foreclosure.see eaton i, 462 mass. at 571 (construing ""mortgagee"" as used in certain foreclosure-related statutes as ""the person or entity then holding the mortgage and also either holding the mortgage note or acting on behalf of the note holder"").  citing eaton i, 462 mass. at 571 & n.2, fannie mae disagrees, stating thatpage 219it is enough for it to have ""owned"" the note, regardless of whether it physically possessed the note, where green tree was an authorized servicer, acting on behalf of fannie mae.  thus, says fannie mae, any factual dispute over physical possession of the note is immaterial.  the motion judge agreed, and, on this basis, declined to determine whether there were facts in dispute as to whether fannie mae had physical possession of the note at the time of the foreclosure.  as a result, the judge ruled in favor of fannie mae and green tree on the basis that fannie mae was the owner of the note at the time of foreclosure, and green tree was its agent.we decline to reach the ""ownership"" issue because fannie mae has provided competent evidence that it had physical possession of the note at the time of the foreclosure, while eaton has offered no countervailing evidence.specifically, fannie mae submitted the affidavits of ana barajas, a senior associate for its document custodian, the bank of new york mellon trust company, n.a. (bnym), and michael ann williamson, a vice president in green tree's document custody department.  both affidavits recite that they are based upon personal knowledge and review of the business records kept in the usual course of business by each affiant's respective employer.barajas avers that bnym served as document custodian for certain fannie mae mortgage loans.  the affidavit states that bnym received eaton's note from fannie mae on or about july 10, 2009 - before the foreclosure.  bnym retained physical custody of the note from that date until october 4, 2013, when the note was sent to green tree.the williamson affidavit authenticates the custodial agreement between fannie mae and bnym,as well as a redacted list of mortgage loans.  that list identifies eaton's note (by loan number) as one of those as to which bnym agreed to take custody.  williamson, on behalf of green tree, states unequivocally thatpage 220bnym sent the note to green tree on october 4, 2013.eaton counters that the barajas and williamson affidavits are not competent to show that bnym had physical possession of the note in october and november of 2009, because they are not based on personal knowledge and violate the best evidence rule.  we disagree.  the affidavits satisfy the personal knowledge requirement of mass.r.civ.p. 56(e),  365 mass. 824  (1974).  they are submitted by individuals employed by the relevant parties, attest to the transfer of the note from fannie mae's custodian, bnym, to its new servicer, green tree, and are based on a review of the business records of each entity.  ""the affidavit[s] [were] made on the basis of personal knowledge of the . . . practices of the parties as well as a review of business records and it was sufficient.""  first natl. bank of cape cod v. north adams hoosac sav. bank,, 791, 794 (1979).moreover, the best evidence rule -- that an original writing or record is required in order to prove its content, see mass. g. evid. § 1002 (2017) -- is inapplicable here.  ""[a]part from the contents of a writing[,] [the best evidence] rule does not require that a fact be proved in only one way.""  commonwealth v. locke,, 687 (1959).  fannie mae's affidavits are not offered to prove the content of any document.  contrast khalsa v. sovereign bank, n.a.,, 824-826 (2016).  rather, they are offered to prove the physical location of the note at a particular time.  see ecclesiastes 3:1, inc. v. cambridge sav. bank,, 381 (1980).eaton's argument reduces to the contention that first-hand knowledge must be demonstrated by either a first-hand account of the individual who received the note from bankunited, or production of other contemporaneous documentation.  for the reasons stated, fannie mae's affidavits were sufficient to demonstrate that it had physical possession of the note at the time of the foreclosure.  at that juncture, eaton was required to offer affidavits or other recordpage 221evidence setting forth specific facts showing that the absence of contemporaneous documentation created a genuine issue of material fact as to possession of the note during the relevant time period.  see mass.r.civ.p. 56(e).  however, eaton offered no evidence that the lack of contemporaneous documentation violated fannie mae policy, industry practice, or legal or regulatory requirements, or was in some other way suspect at the time the note was sent to bnym.  in these unique circumstances, eaton's ""bare assertion[s]"" are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact.see community natl. bank v. dawes,, 559 (1976).  because the barajas and williamson affidavits meet the requirements of rule 56(e), summary judgment for fannie mae and green tree was properly granted with respect to eaton's claim that the foreclosure did not comply with the requirements of eaton i.2.  strict compliance with paragraph 22.  next, eaton contends that bankunited's november 14, 2008, right to cure notice did not strictly comply with paragraph 22 of eaton's mortgage.  see pinti, 472 mass. at 227.  paragraph 22 of eaton's mortgage requires that a notice be sent prior to acceleration of her debt.  the paragraph provides, in pertinent part:""the notice shall specify:  (a) the default; (b) the action required to cure the default; (c) a date, not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given to the borrower, by which the default must be cured; and (d) that failure to cure the default on or before the date specified in the notice may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this security instrument and sale of the property.""paragraph 22 also requires that ""[t]he notice shall further inform borrower of the right to reinstate after acceleration and the right to bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense of borrower to acceleration and sale.""in pinti, supra, the supreme judicial court held that the provisions of paragraph 22 of fannie mae's uniform home mortgagepage 222""constitute 'terms of the mortgage' governing the power of sale,"" as that phrase is used in g. l. c. 183, § 21, and, accordingly, a valid foreclosure requires strict compliance ""with paragraph 22's notice of default provisions.""  id. at 240.bankunited's notice complied with paragraph 22 insofar as it listed the amount of the default, stated that the default could be cured by paying that amount, and provided a deadline of february 12, 2009, for curing the default -- more than thirty days after the date of the notice.  the notice further stated, ""if the default is not cured by february 12, 2009, bankunited may take steps to terminate your ownership in the property by a foreclosure proceeding or other action to seize your home.""unlike the notice at issue in pinti,eaton's notice did not incorrectly suggest that bankunited would be required to bring a court action in order to foreclose -- which eaton would then have an opportunity to defend.  instead, it stated clearly:  ""[y]ou have the right to . . . bring a court action to assert the non-existence of a default or any other defense to acceleration or sale.""eaton argues, however, that the notice did not sufficiently convey that a failure to cure the default could result in a ""sale of the property.""  pinti requires that the mortgagee ""send[] a notice that conforms to the language of the paragraph.""  472 mass. at 238.  it does not require that the notice quote word for word from the mortgage.  here, the notice stated that if the default were not cured, bankunited might ""take steps to terminate your ownership in the property by a foreclosure proceeding or other action to seize the home.""  the language strictly complies with paragraph 22.3.  bankunited's authority to send the paragraph 22 notice.  eaton fares better with her argument that a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether bankunited was authorized to send thepage 223paragraph 22 notice in the first place.paragraph 22 requires the ""lender"" to give the borrower notice of the right to cure.  eaton claims that under eaton i and pinti, supra, a paragraph 22 notice is valid only if it is sent by the ""lender"" or its agent, and the ""lender"" necessarily must be the note holder because the note holder is the only entity that can authorize an exercise of the power of sale.  see pinti, 472 mass. at 227.  see also eaton i, 462 mass. at 571, citing g. l. c. 183, § 21, and g. l. c. 244, § 14, as then in effect.  therefore, eaton contends, because the ""lender"" is the only entity that has the authority to send the paragraph 22 notice, ""strict compliance"" with the terms of paragraph 22 means that notice must be sent by the ""lender"" or its agent.  see pinti, supra.  see also eaton i, supra.  thus, she claims, summary judgment could not be awarded to fannie mae without a showing that bankunited was either the note holder or acted on behalf of fannie mae as note holder when it sent the paragraph 22 notice in november, 2008.on appeal, fannie mae makes no argument as to whether proof is required that either it or bankunited had physical possession of the note at the time the notice to cure was sent.  nor does fannie mae argue that it or bankunited was the noteholder at that time.  instead, fannie mae relies solely on bankunited's purported authority as its servicer to send the notice.fannie mae has not, however, provided competent evidence that bankunited acted as its agent in sending the notice.in the summary judgment proceedings, fannie mae relied on the affidavit of thomas clark, a foreclosure manager for green tree.  although clark's affidavit states that it is made on behalf of fannie mae as well as green tree, he does not allege that he worked for either fannie mae or bankunited at any time.  and, while he claims to have personal knowledge of the facts in question,page 224there is no basis in the affidavit to establish personal knowledge of the facts at the time that bankunited sent the notice.nor does it appear that he ""would have been competent to testify to any of the[se] critical matters at trial.""  stanton indus., inc. v. columbus mills, inc.,, 794 (1976).even if we were to consider the affidavit, it fails to establish that there is no dispute of material fact as to bankunited's agency relationship with fannie mae and bankunited's authority to foreclose.  the affidavit states that after eaton's loan closed in september, 2007, ""bankunited serviced the loan.""  however, although clark states he reviewed green tree's business records, he does not aver that those records contained a servicing agreement between bankunited and fannie mae, or that the records contained any other document granting bankunited authority to foreclose.  moreover, during discovery, fannie mae declined to produce a written servicing agreement between bankunited and fannie mae.  nor did fannie mae provide any other evidence that it had authorized bankunited to send the right to cure notice.  accordingly, fannie mae's evidence on authority was woefully short of what is required by mass.r.civ.p. 56(e).  see khalsa, 88 mass. app. ct. at 828-829.conclusion.  so much of the judgment as ruled against eaton on her claim that the foreclosure was invalid because the paragraph 22 notice was not authorized by the note holder is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.so ordered.",civil,Paul E.

[230-232]at a criminal trial, there was no error in the admission of an in-court identification of the defendant by a witness who was not present during the commission of the crime but whose prior familiarity with the defendant was the source of the original identification of the defendant as a person of interest in the investigation. [232]","after a jury trial, the defendant, robert galipeau, was convicted of armed robbery arising from the gunpoint theft of cash from three men at approximately 1 a.m. on april 18, 2013, immediately after the victims left the assembly bar in quincy.  the sole issue at trial was the identification of the robber.  the defendant argues on appeal that his motion to suppress a photographic identification should have been allowed and that the trial judge improperly allowed an in-court identification.  we affirm.1.  motion to suppress photographic identification.  ""we recite the facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented by uncontroverted testimony"" submitted during the evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress.  commonwealth v. cordero,, 238 (2017).  we accept all of the judge's factual findings, none of which is clearly erroneous.  see commonwealth v. borgos,, 32 (2012).after the robbery, leo tang, one of the victims, told the police that the robber had followed him and his two friends from the assembly bar to his car across the street.  tang described the robber as a white male, approximately five feet, ten inches tall, scruffy looking, with facial hair, and wearing a hooded sweatshirt, gray shirt, and jeans.  tang had seen the man in the bar earlier that night, with a budweiser beer next to him.  after the police received this information from tang, an officer met with robert sylva, the bar manager, to view surveillance videotape.  the videotape depicted a white man drinking a budweiser at a table; he fit the description tang had given.  sylva told the officer that the person drinking a budweiser in the video was the defendant.once the police had the defendant's name, two officers went to his home and knocked on his front door but received no answer.  they went toward the rear door, and, while walking along the right side of the house, they saw the defendant standing at the sink in the kitchen of the ground floor apartment.  the officers then went back to the front door and knocked again.  they knocked on the door without response for a lengthy period of time before the defendant finally answered.  he was wearing only a pair of jeans and sneakers, and his face appeared to be freshly shaved, with cuts on his upper and lower lip that were actively bleeding.at approximately 3 a.m., police officers brought tang, in a police cruiser, to the street outside the defendant's house for a showup identification procedure.  tang viewed the defendant, who was standing on the sidewalk, for five to ten minutes.  tang didpage 227not identify the defendant as the robber at that time, saying that he could not be sure of an identification because the robber had been scruffier, with facial hair.later that day, quincy police detective ricky wash created a computer-generated photo array, including the defendant's photo and six other photos of men with similar physical characteristics.the photo identification procedure was administered by detective michael ward, who was otherwise uninvolved in the investigation.tang viewed the photos one at a time, and, when he came to the second photo, he said it looked similarto the robber, but he was having trouble making a positive identification because the robber had been wearing a hat and a hooded sweatshirt.  at ward's instruction, tang went through the remaining photos.  when he returned to the second photo, ward put a piece of paper over the upper head of the person depicted and tang covered the person's ears with his hands.  tang then wrote on the photo, at ward's request, ""i believe this is the suspect because he seems like an average white male.  the chin structure with a little facial hair look similar.  i couldn't see his head or ears because he wore a hat and hoodie at the time.""a.  multiple identification procedures.  ""for a motion to suppress a photographic identification to succeed, the defendant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that, in light of the totality of the circumstances, the procedures employed were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification as to deny the defendant due process of law.""commonwealth v. borgos,, 32 (2012), quoting from commonwealth v. watson,, 250page 228(2009).  see mass. g. evid. § 1112(b)(1)(2017).  in reviewing a decision on such a motion, we ""review without deference the judge's application of the law to the facts as found.""  commonwealth v. johnson,, 602 (2016).the defendant's primary argument is that the unsuccessful showup tainted the subsequent photo array procedure, rendering it impermissibly suggestive.  the motion judge addressed this issue squarely and concluded that conducting a photo array procedure that included the defendant, after tang had failed to identify him at the showup, ""may not be ideal, but was warranted where the defendant had apparently altered his appearance since the time of the crime.""we agree with the motion judge.  the evidence before him at the suppression hearing strongly suggested that the defendant had shaved immediately before he answered the door to his home in the early morning hours of april 18, 2013.  in addition, tang indicated at the showup that the reason he could not identify the defendant as the robber was the difference in the very feature that the defendant had apparently altered.  under these circumstances, it was appropriate for the police to conduct a second identification procedure.moreover, massachusetts courts have ""declined to adopt 'a per se exclusionary rule condemning as constitutionally infirm all subsequent identifications of a defendant by any witness who had previously failed to select the defendant.'""  commonwealth v. paszko,, 171 (1984), quoting from commonwealth v. lacy,, 369 (1976).  even where the defendant's photograph is the only one duplicated in multiple arrays, the resulting out-of-court identification is not necessarily inadmissible.  see commonwealth v. carter,, 518 (2016).see also paszko, supra at 168-169; commonwealth v. holland,page 229, 254 (1991).  moreover, the supreme judicial court has upheld the admission of identification evidence in circumstances similar to those presented here.see commonwealth v. forte,, 476 (2014) (witness made identification from photo array after failing to identify defendant at showup and then being shown videotape footage from security camera).here, the fact that tang participated in multiple identification procedures did not render the identification ""unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification.""  borgos, 464 mass. at 32 (quotation omitted).b.  ""cropping"" of the photo.  next, the defendant contends that the photo array was impermissibly suggestive because ward and tang covered the upper head and ears of the defendant's photograph only -- and not the other six.  the defendant's reliance on borgos, supra, is, however, misplaced.  there, in showing the same photographic array to three out of four witnesses, the administering officer covered the defendant's hair with a paper after an initial identification by the witness.  id. at 32-33.  the supreme judicial court rejected the argument that covering a part of the photograph was unnecessarily suggestive, noting that this procedure did not occur ""until after a positive identification had been made by the witness.""  id. at 34.the defendant argues that the initial identifications in borgos, supra, were unequivocal, as compared to tang's less certain initial selection of the defendant's photo -- and, therefore, we should read borgos as supporting his position.  however, even if the defendant is correct that the witnesses in borgos were somewhat less equivocal in their initial selection of the suspect's photo than tang, that does not mean that the procedure used here was impermissibly suggestive.  nothing in borgos is to the contrary.page 230tang testified at the suppression hearing that, after he picked out the defendant's photograph on his own, he told ward he was having trouble making an identification because the robber had been wearing a hat and a hooded sweatshirt.ward's use of the paper to cover the upper head in the defendant's photograph was a direct response to tang's statement.tang then, independently, covered the ears in the photo with his own hands.  this procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive, and any equivocation in tang's initial identification went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility.  see commonwealth v. sullivan,, 806-807 (2002) (""the tentative nature of an identification does not disqualify it from admission, but goes to its weight"").c.  reliability.  finally, the defendant urges that, even if police procedures were not unnecessarily suggestive, tang's out-of-court identification of the defendant should have been excluded as unreliable pursuant to johnson, 473 mass. at 604 n.4.  johnson, however, does not assist the defendant for two reasons.first, the better view of the law existing at the time of the hearing on the motion to suppress is correctly reflected in the judge's ruling that he was not authorized to consider the reliability of tang's identification once he had determined that police procedures were not unnecessarily suggestive.  see commonwealth v. cavitt,, 632 (2011), quoting from watson, 455 mass. at 251 (""where an identification procedure is not impermissibly suggestive, a pretrial identification is admissible without any further showing"").  see also paszko, 391 mass. at 172; commonwealth v. warren,, 140 (1988); commonwealth v. ross,, 560 (1998).  johnson was decided nearly two years after the judge issued his decision on the defendant's motion to suppress, and a few weeks after his trial.  see commonwealth v. crayton,, 245 (2014) (judge did not abuse discretion where admission of in-court identification was in accord with then-existing case law); commonwealth v. bastaldo,, 21-23 (2016) (trial judge did not err in giving jury instruction based on law at time of trial).page 231in any event, johnson did not alter longstanding authority holding that assessment of an eyewitness identification is for the jury where the police procedures did not violate the defendant's constitutional rights.second, to the extent that the motion judge in this case was authorized to consider reliability, any exercise of that authority is reviewable only for abuse of discretion and is not subject to the independent appellate review afforded a legal conclusion regarding constitutional rights.  see johnson, 473 mass. at 602.  see also commonwealth v. thomas,, 465 (2017).here, in an abundance of caution, the motion judge considered reliability and found that, even if a reliability analysis were legally available, ""the identification would not be considered so unreliable as to require exclusion where suppression was not constitutionally compelled.""having reviewed the record thoroughly, we see nopage 232abuse of discretion in the judge's finding.2.  trial identification.  the defendant argues that sylva, the bar manager, should not have been permitted to identify the defendant in court at the trial because he had not previously participated in an out-of-court identification procedure.  the suggestion that the police should have subjected sylva to an out-of-court identification procedure is unreasonable, considering that sylva's prior familiarity with the defendant was the source of the police officers' original identification of the defendant as a person of interest in the investigation.the defendant is correct that the ""good reason"" requirement announced in crayton, 470 mass. at 241-242, did not apply to sylva's testimony because this requirement explicitly applies only to in-court identifications by eyewitnesses who were present during the commission of the crime.  see commonwealth v. collins,, 265 (2014).  there was, however, no harm in the prosecutor's bringing a motion in limine pursuant to crayton and collins concerning sylva's proposed testimony.  this could only have benefited the defendant.  moreover, to the extent the ""good reason"" standard was properly applied to sylva's proposed testimony, his familiarity with the defendant before the crime satisfied that requirement.  see crayton, supra at 242.for all of these reasons, we are satisfied that, the commonwealth's identification evidence was properly admitted and was sufficient to support the jury's verdicts.judgments affirmed.",criminal,Thomas A.

increase the floor area and alter the site plan.  notice of the application and the public hearing ""was given to persons affected and was published and posted, all as required by g. l. c. 40a, § 11,

the city clerk on november 13, 2015.murrow received notice of the zba decision and filed a complaint in the land court on december 3, 2015.  she alleged, among other things, that esh's proposed changes would cause a detrimental health, safety, and welfare effect on murrow and esh's surrounding neighbors.  waylonis filed a motion to dismiss murrow's complaint on july 8, 2016, arguing that murrow was not an aggrieved party and therefore lacked standing.  the parties filed an excerpt of the somerville zoning code and a list of abutters for the judge's consideration.  following a hearing,

we disagree.to have standing to challenge the decision of a municipal zoning authority, a plaintiff must be a person aggrieved.  g. l.page 235c. 40a, § 17.  see marinelli v. board of appeals of stoughton,, 257 (2003).  aggrieved person status is jurisdictional.  denneny v. zoning bd. of appeals of seekonk,, 211 (2003), citing barvenik v. aldermen of newton,, 131 (1992).  demonstrating aggrievement requires a plaintiff to show she has suffered a specialized, cognizable injury ""not merely reflective of the concerns of the community.""  denneny, supra at 211-212, citing harvard square defense fund, inc. v. planning bd. of cambridge,, 492-493 (1989).  a plaintiff is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of aggrievement if she is a ""party in interest"" under § 11.id. at 212.  as defined there, ""party in interest"" refers to ""the petitioner, abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet of the property line of the petitioner as they appear on the most recent applicable tax list.""  g. l. c. 40a, § 11.  by § 11's strict terms, murrow -- who lives across the street from, but not directly opposite, esh's property -- is not, and does not allege to be, the petitioner, an abutter, or the owner of land directly across from esh's property.however, murrow does claim that she is a party in interest as one of the ""abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet"" because she lives within three hundred feet of the esh property.  we disagree.  when interpreting a statute, ""each clause or phrase is to be construed with reference to every other clause or phrase without giving undue emphasis to any one group of words.""  worcester v. college hill properties llc,, 139 (2013), quoting from selectmen of topsfield v. state racing commn.,, 312-313 (1949).  the phrase ""within three hundred feet"" modifies ""abutters to the abutters"" and does not create a standalone category of parties in interest.  to read § 11 otherwise would ""render [a] portion of it meaningless,"" adamowicz v. ipswich,, 760 (1985), which we decline to do.murrow also claims she has standing pursuant to the fourth sentence of g. l. c. 40a, § 11, which states that ""[t]he assessorspage 236maintaining any applicable tax list shall certify to the . . . special permit granting authority the names and addresses of parties in interest[,]"" which ""shall be conclusive for all purposes.""  ibid.  murrow claims that, because she received notice of the public hearing and of the zba's decision, presumably by virtue of her appearance on a certified abutters list, she qualifies for the rebuttable presumption, even if she does not meet the definition in the third sentence of § 11.  as a plain reading of § 11 belies murrow's claim, we disagree.as previously explained, the third sentence of § 11 provides a limited definition of ""parties in interest"" to be used throughout g. l. c. 40a.  in particular, it states that more remote abutters, i.e., abutters to abutters within three hundred feet, are considered parties in interest ""as they appear on the most recent applicable tax list.""  as discussed above, murrow does not qualify as a party in interest under this provision.  the fourth sentence of § 11 provides that tax assessors ""shall certify . . . the names and addresses of parties in interest,"" which is a reference to the definition of parties in interest expressed in the previous sentence.  it does not expand the earlier definition, nor does it empower the tax assessor to identify individuals as parties in interest who do not meet the limited statutory definition.in addition, this provision states that the tax assessor's certification of parties in interest ""shall be conclusive for all purposes.""  in light of the limited scope of the assessor's certification in the context of the notice requirement of § 11, we do not interpret ""for all purposes"" to mean that the tax list creates new parties in interest.  to do so would nullify the clear and unambiguous definition set forth in the previous sentence.  furthermore, such an interpretation would ignore much of the standing jurisprudence related to g. l. c. 40a, §§ 8,11, and 17.see chongris v. bd. of appeals of andover,, 1000 (1984), citing turner v. bd. of appeals of milton,, 192-193 (1940).  rather, the tax list identifies and certifies owners of relevant properties, a subset of which may fit within the narrow confines of the ""parties in interest"" definition, and that certificationpage 237of ownership shall be conclusive.  put another way, although the list may contain individuals who do not qualify as ""parties in interest"" under the statutory definition, such as murrow, the assessor's certification is conclusive as to who owns what parcel for the purposes of the notice requirement; it is not an unassailable list of parties with standing.taking the facts in the complaint in the light most favorable to murrow, her name appears on two abutter's lists,and she received a notice of the public hearing and of the zba's ultimate decision.  this does not entitle her to the rebuttable presumption afforded parties in interest under the statute.  were we to adopt murrow's reasoning and find otherwise, tax assessors would be empowered to confer standing on parties who are otherwise not identified in § 11 as parties in interest.  we decline to create such an impracticable result.  

	b.  burden to plead aggrievement.  finally, murrow claims that the judge improperly placed on her the burden to plead that she is aggrieved by esh's application for special permit.  we disagree.murrow properly observes that if a plaintiff qualifies for the rebuttable presumption of ""standing as an aggrieved person, a defendant must offer evidence warranting a finding contrary to the presumed fact.""  marinelli, 440 mass. at 258.  however, as here, when a plaintiff fails to meet the ""party in interest"" designation, she may nevertheless have standing if she is a person aggrieved, in other words, if the ""permit causes, or threatens with reasonable likelihood, a tangible and particularized injury to a private property or legal interest protected by zoning law.""  standerwick v. zoning bd. of appeals of andover,, 340 (2005), s.c.(2006), citing marashlianpage 238v. zoning bd. of appeals of newburyport,, 723 (1996).  but it is always a plaintiff's burden to demonstrate her aggrievement.  standerwick v. zoning bd. of appeals, 447 mass. at 34-35 n.20.here, the judge did not err in dismissing murrow's complaint for lack of standing.  because murrow does not qualify as a party in interest and is not entitled to the presumption, the burden remained on her to put forth credible facts of her specialized injury.  despite having the opportunity to do so at the hearing, murrow chose to rely on the bald allegations in her complaint, which fail to set forth a particularized injury caused by esh's proposed expansion.  instead, murrow claims personal damages in only two paragraphs of her factual allegations, where she generally alleged that esh's ""recreational use"" and ""proposed increase in size and occupancy"" would be ""detrimental to murrow and the neighborhood by increasing the potential for overcrowding and undue concentration of population, discouraging housing for persons of all income levels, enhancing danger from fire, diminishing the value of surrounding properties, and adding to noise, light, traffic, loss of privacy, and trespass.""this conclusory statement, unadorned with particularized details, is insufficient to establish aggrievement.  see nickerson v. zoning bd. of appeals of raynham,, 683 (2002) (""while the plaintiff undoubtedly is inconvenienced by the heavy traffic . . . this evidence is an insufficient predicate for finding that he is a 'person aggrieved'"").  compare marashlian, supra at 723 (standing found where defendant's hotel project would likely increase traffic and eliminate some public parking, upon which plaintiffs relied for ""business and personal needs""); bertrand v. board of appeals of bourne,, 912 (2003) (finding standing existed where plaintiff alleged environmental impacts of the septic system, increase in artificial light and noise, and decrease in privacy resulting from defendant building two houses directly behind the plaintiff's house).  therefore, contrary to murrow's claim, the judge did not err in finding that murrow had the burden to show an ""alleged injury"" that was ""special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community"" and failed to do so.  compare boston edison co. v. boston redev. authy.,, 46 (1977) (boston edison has standing as a ""person aggrieved"" where its loss is ""direct, substantial, and ascertainable"").c.  esh's demand for costs, damages, and attorney's fees.  although murrow has failed to persuade us that the judge erred inpage 239dismissing her claims, sanctions are not warranted as this appeal is neither frivolous nor was it initiated in bad faith.  see avery v. steele,, 455 (1993).  we therefore decline to exercise our discretion to award attorney's fees, costs, and damages.  see masterpiece kitchen & bath, inc. v. gordon,, 330 (1997).judgment affirmed.this case involves an important question that has vexed the judges of the trial court, who have reached different conclusions about it.  i join the court's opinion, but add a few words since the statute says the assessors' certified list of ""the names and addresses of parties in interest"" shall be ""conclusive for all purposes,"" and, at least at first blush, it may look like we are holding it is not conclusive for at least one purpose, the rebuttable presumption of standing given by our courts to those defined by the statute as ""parties in interest.""  see g. l. c. 40a, § 11.the question of standing involves a construction of who is a ""person aggrieved"" under g. l. c. 40a, § 17.  while some ""parties in interest"" may also be ""person[s] aggrieved,"" and vice versa, the concepts are different.  see, e.g., denneny v. zoning bd. of appeals of seekonk,, 212-213 (2003) (plaintiff was an abutter to an abutter within three hundred feet of the petitioner's property line, and thus a ""party in interest,"" but was not a ""person aggrieved"" by the board's decision).the prior version of what is now g. l. c. 40a, § 11, provided that,""the board of appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of any appeal or other matter referred to it or any petition for a variance, and give public notice thereof in an official publication, or a newspaper of general circulation, in the city or town, and also send notice by mail, postage prepaid, to the petitioner and to the owners of all property deemed by the board to be affected thereby, as they appear on the most recent local tax list, and to the planning board of such city or town.""g. l. c. 40a, § 17, as appearing in st. 1954, c. 368, § 2.page 240in marotta v. board of appeals of revere,(1957), the supreme judicial court held ""that there is a presumption that property owners to whom the board in the performance of its statutory obligation has sent notice as persons 'deemed by the board to be affected thereby' have an interest and are persons aggrieved.  'it ordinarily must be presumed that such determination of landowners likely to be affected will be made in good faith and exclude none fairly within the scope of the statute.'  godfrey v. building commissioner of boston,, 591 [1928].""  id. at 204 (footnote omitted).  of the rebuttable presumption of standing it articulated, the court also said that ""it is a rule of reason which, in the absence of direct evidence on the issue, will hold the board to the implications of its own determination and carry the appealing parties over the jurisdictional threshold.""  ibid.apparently concerned about the discretion given the zoning boards of appeals to determine under this section who would receive notice, the legislature in 1975 amended it.  rather than leaving the determination of who should get notice to the judgment of the zbas, it created the previously unknown legal category, ""parties in interest:""  as originally enacted, the statute said ""'[p]arties in interest' as used in this chapter shall mean the petitioner, abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way and owners of land within three hundred feet of the property line all as they appear on the most recent applicable tax list, notwithstanding that the land of any such owner is located in another city or town, the planning board of the city or town, and, the planning board of every abutting [city or town].""  g. l. c. 40a, § 11, as appearing in st. 1975, c. 808, § 3.  under this definition, murrow would have been a party in interest.  the statute was further amended, however, in 1979 to partially narrow ""parties in interest,"" so that instead of including all ""owners within three hundred feet of the property line"" it now includes only ""abutters of the abutters within three hundred feet of the property line of the petitioner.""  st. 1979, c. 117.  parties in interest, as defined by the statute, are entitled to notice.  see g. l. c. 40a, §§ 9, 9a, 10, 11, 15, 16.the 1975 amendment also added the language at issue in this case, providing, ""[t]he assessors maintaining any applicable tax list shall certify to the permit granting authority or special permitpage 241granting authority the names and addresses of parties in interest and such certification shall be conclusive for all purposes.""  while ultimately we need not decide the issue in this case, i note that it is not clear with respect to what ""such certification"" is supposed to be conclusive.  perhaps it is conclusive with respect to ""the names and addresses"" of parties in interest, and if a person within the statutory definition is missing from the list, he or she can nonetheless be notified.  perhaps it is supposed to be conclusive only for all purposes of the authority to which the certification is made.  or perhaps, as ms. murrow argues, it is supposed to be conclusive as to what owners meet the statutory definition, providing a conclusive list identifying the names and addresses of ""parties in interest.""even assuming the latter is the case, however, ultimately we are not concerned here with who are deemed ""parties in interest.""  we are concerned with who is entitled to the rebuttable presumption of standing.  the statute does not say that ""parties in interest"" are to be given a presumption that they are ""persons aggrieved.""  if it did, perhaps the certified list would control for that purpose, though, again, we need not resolve that question.the presumption of standing articulated in marotta was a judicial creation, and, in the absence of legislation, its scope must be judicially determined.  it actually originated both out of deference to the statutorily mandated determinations of the zoning appeals boards and as a means of holding those boards to their determinations as to which property owners were ""affected"" by their decisions:  if a board determined that a property owner would be affected by its decision, as evidenced by its notifying the property owner, that property owner's appeal would be ""carr[ied] . . . over the jurisdictional threshold"" unless there was ""direct evidence on the issue.""  marotta, 336 mass. at 204.marotta itself of course does not address the significance of being a ""party in interest"" -- a concept the legislature did not adopt until almost twenty years after that decision - and so the use of that designation to create a presumption of standing cannot have been one of the ""purposes"" contemplated by the legislature in 1975.  rather, appellate cases decided after the 1975 amendments to the statute have given a judge-made rebuttable presumption of standing to this newly-defined category.  they have done so by citation to marotta, and without any explicit analysis of why the rebuttable presumption, originally given to those deemed by the board to be affected, should be given to statutorily describedpage 242""parties in interest.""  see, e.g., watros v. greater lynn mental health & retardation assn., inc.,, 111 (1995); marashlian v. zoning bd. of appeals of newburyport,, 721 (1996); 81 spooner road, llc v. zoning bd. of appeals of brookline,, 700 (2012); valcourt v. zoning bd. of appeals of swansea,, 127-128 (1999); choate v. zoning bd. of appeals of mashpee,, 381 (2006).in my view, however, the reason our courts provide this rebuttable presumption is clear:  it is not because the parties have been given notice, which is what the legislature has required be provided to ""parties in interest,"" or because they have been deemed ""parties in interest,"" whether by a tax assessor, a zoning board of appeals, or anyone else.  it is because they meet the definition of ""parties in interest"" set out by the legislature.  i believe our cases and those of the supreme judicial court are best understood to reflect a conclusion that, if the legislature believes those individuals and entities are entitled to notice, they are also entitled to a rebuttable presumption of standing.  cf. standerwick v. zoning bd. of appeals of andover,, 33 (2006) (presumption of standing exists because ""those entitled to notice of the proceedings are presumed to have the requisite interest"").i would not expand the category of those who are entitled to the presumption of standing to include those outside the definition who happen to be on a tax assessors' certified list, nor would i contract it to exclude any of those within the definition who are left off such a list.  whether someone within the definition has been left off the certified list, or, as here, someone not within the definition has been added, or, indeed, whether or not the certified name or address is wrong, i believe those actually within the definition are the ones entitled to the judicially-created rebuttable presumption of standing and, consequently, that a court must independently determine whether a party meets the definition.  consequently, even if the tax assessors' certified list amounts to a conclusive determination of who are the ""parties in interest"" that must receive notice, that list is ultimately irrelevant to the determination the court must make of which parties are entitled under the case law to the rebuttable presumption they are ""persons aggrieved.""  ms. murrow is not entitled to that presumption; someone in her circumstance might nonetheless be a ""person aggrieved,"" but the burden was on her to demonstrate that fact, and, since she failed to do so, the judgment must be affirmed.",civil,Gordon H.

[248-249]","the principle that ""if there is tortious injury there is liability"" is one of long standing in massachusetts when the parties are private actors.  historically, however, the principle had no application when the negligent actors were employees of state or local government, because their employers were shielded from such lawsuits based upon the ancient doctrine of sovereignpage 244immunity.  morash & sons v. commonwealth,, 618-619 (1973).  with the adoption of the massachusetts tort claims act in 1978, g. l. c. 258 (act), inserted by st. 1978, c. 512, § 15, the legislature abolished much of the governmental immunity doctrine subject to several exclusions.  see g. l. c. 258, §§ 2, 10(a)-(j).  recently, in cormier v. lynn,(2018), the supreme judicial court considered the applicability of a specific exclusion in the act that bars ""any claim based on an act or failure to act to prevent or diminish the harmful consequences of a condition or situation, including the violent or tortious conduct of a third person, which is not originally caused by the public employer or any other person acting on behalf of the public employer.""  g. l. c. 258, § 10(j), inserted by st. 1993, c. 495, § 57.  in cormier, the court, in keeping with prior case law, held that § 10(j) comes into play unless the public employer, by some affirmative act, ""originally caused"" the condition or situation that forms the basis for the plaintiff's negligence claim, 479 mass. at 40, and determined that a grade school student who suffered a severe spinal injury as a result of being pushed down a stairwell at school by a classmate could not bring suit against the city of lynn and its school department, among others.  the court concluded that the claims were barred either because they ""originat[ed] from a failure to act rather than an affirmative act,"" or because any affirmative actions by the defendants were ""'too remote as a matter of law to be the original cause' of [the student's] injuries . . . and therefore cannot be said to have 'materially contributed' to creating the specific condition or situation resulting in [the] injuries.""  id. at 41, citing brum v. dartmouth,, 696 (1999), and kent v. commonwealth,, 319 (2002).in the case before us, we must determine whether § 10(j) is applicable to negligence claims brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant, lincoln sudbury regional high school district (defendant).  the plaintiffs' claims arise out of an injury sustained by alexandra stahr, a member of the defendant's varsity field hockey team, who was struck by a field hockey stick wielded by another team member during a practice session.  in addition, we also must consider whether a specific statutory exception to the immunity afforded by § 10(j) permits the plaintiffs' claims to proceed because they are grounded in ""the intervention of a public employee which causes injury to the victim or places the victim in a worse position than [s]he was in before thepage 245intervention.""  g. l. c. 258, § 10(j)(2).  for the reasons that follow, we conclude that notwithstanding the serious injuries suffered by alexandra,the plaintiffs' claims are barred by § 10(j) and do not come within the saving provision of § 10(j)(2).in their amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the defendant was negligent in (1) failing to properly train and supervise the athletic coaches and athletes present when alexandra was injured; (2) failing to seek adequate medical assistance at the time of her injuries and, further, failing to provide adequate postinjury monitoring and planning related to alexandra's injuries; and (3) failing to implement a written academic reentry plan following alexandra's injuries.  the plaintiffs also assert claims premised on negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium due to the acts and omissions of the defendant.the defendant filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6),  365 mass. 754  (1974), on the basis that g. l. c. 258, § 10(j), barred the claims brought against the defendant, a regional school district.  the motion judge dismissed the complaint in its entirety after finding that g. l. c. 258, § 10(j), insulated the defendant from liability.  for the reasons set forth below, we affirm.background.  on september 30, 2012, alexandra participated in field hockey practice as a member of the defendant's varsity field hockey team.  on that day, the team participated in a drill introduced and supervised by an alumna player acting as a volunteer coach (volunteer coach).  the head varsity field hockey coach (head coach) was also present on the field but did not actively participate in the supervision of the drill.  prior to beginning the drill, neither coach gave the players any instructions or warnings as to techniques that could endanger other players.  the coaches also failed to prohibit the players from practicing dangerous techniques and did not inform the players that they would be penalized for utilizing such techniques.  during the drill, alexandra was struck in the face by a teammate's field hockey stick after the teammate chose to pass the ball via a ""hard-drive"" as opposed to a ""push-pass.""  the blow knocked out two of alexandra's teeth and caused her to lose consciousness.the volunteer coach did not provide alexandra with assistance after she was injured.  the head coach left the field to find first aidpage 246supplies and did not immediately assist alexandra or assess her injuries.  while the head coach was getting supplies, one of alexandra's teammates called alexandra's father.  upon her return to the field, the head coach, who had retrieved one of alexandra's teeth, put it on ice and directed alexandra to apply ice and gauze to her mouth.  the head coach did not take any steps to mitigate the effects of a possible concussion, and the defendant had not yet implemented a concussion protocol as required by g. l. c. 111, § 222, and 105 code mass. regs. §§ 201.00 et seq. (2011).when alexandra's father arrived at the field, the head coach did not explain to him the circumstances of alexandra's injury or provide advice about how to treat her injury, including the proper protocol to follow in the event of a suspected concussion.  alexandra's father took her for emergency dental surgery but failed to seek further emergency medical treatment.alexandra was subsequently diagnosed with a concussion on october 5, 2012.  the symptoms of her concussion caused her academic performance to suffer over a prolonged period of time.  the defendant provided her with little academic assistance and did not implement a written graduated reentry plan,which ultimately led alexandra to withdraw from lincoln-sudbury regional high school and transfer to another school.discussion.  ""we review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo . . . accept[ing] as true the allegations in the complaint and draw[ing] every reasonable inference in favor of the plaintiff.""  curtis v. herb chambers i-95, inc.,, 676 (2011).1.  general laws c. 258, § 10(j).  in this case, we must once again wade into the ""interpretive quagmire"" that is g. l. c. 258, § 10(j).  see brum, 428 mass. at 692; cormier, 479 mass. at 40 n.10.  section 10(j) confers significant protection from tort liability to public employers by barring ""any claim based on an act or failure to act to prevent or diminish the harmful consequences of a condition or situation, including the violent or tortious conduct of a third person, which is not originally caused by the public employer or any other person acting on behalf of the publicpage 247employer.""g. l. c. 258, § 10(j).  see cormier, supra at 39-40.a.  ""original cause"" of alexandra's injuries.  the plaintiffs first argue that the head coach's decision to allow an ""untrained volunteer coach to introduce and supervise [a] novel close quarters drill"" constituted an affirmative act that was the ""original cause"" of alexandra's injuries.""to have 'originally caused' a condition or situation for the purposes of § 10(j), the public employer must have taken an affirmative action,"" and the employer's act ""must have materially contributed to creating the specific 'condition or situation' that resulted in the harm.""  cormier, 479 mass. at 40, quoting from brum, 428 mass. at 695-696, and kent, 437 mass. at 319.while the plaintiffs argue that the affirmative act of allowing an untrained volunteer coach to supervise a novel drill was the ""original cause"" of alexandra's injuries,their amended complaint makes clear that their claim is rather that the coaches' lack of supervision and inadequate instruction prior to allowing the players to engage in the drill -- both omissions -- caused alexandra's injuries.  the plaintiffs' claim in this respect amounts to an attempt to hold the defendant liable for failing to ensure alexandra's safety during field hockey practice.  as the supreme judicial court stated in cormier, 479 mass. at 42, ""such a claim is precluded under the act.""  the plaintiffs' claim must fail, as it is premised on the defendant's failure to act.  see id. at 41-42 (students instructed to line up before school without adequate supervision or guidance from defendant constituted failure to prevent harm in form of spinal injury to student who was pushed down stairwell, as opposed to affirmative act under § 10[j]).page 248b.  aftermath of the injury.  the plaintiffs next argue that § 10(j) does not bar so much of their claims as are based on the independent negligent acts of the defendant that occurred after alexandra was initially injured.i.  independent acts of negligence.  alexandra's injuries were caused by the negligent act of a third person -- here, her teammate -- and, as discussed supra, the defendant was not the ""original cause"" of alexandra's injuries.  the plaintiffs nevertheless maintain that the defendant is liable by arguing that the defendant's failure to implement and adhere to proper concussion protocols pursuant to g. l. c. 111, § 222, and 105 code mass. regs. §§ 201.00 et seq., constituted independent acts of negligence that exacerbated the harm initially caused by alexandra's teammate.however, § 10(j), by its plain language, precludes liability in such circumstances, as the exclusion is triggered by conduct amounting to a ""failure to act to . . . diminish the harmful consequences of . . . the . . . tortious conduct of a third person, which is not originally caused by the public employer.""  see anderson v. gloucester,, 434-435 (2009) (holding that § 10[j] barred plaintiffs' negligent misidentification claim because police officer's misidentification of fire victim, while affirmative act intended to diminish ultimate harm suffered, was not original cause of harmful consequences suffered by plaintiffs, which stemmed from fire that city did not cause).ii.  negligent intervention under § 10(j)(2).  the plaintiffs further argue that the motion judge erred in dismissing their amendedpage 249complaint because the defendant's negligent intervention falls within the exception to § 10(j) immunity set forth in § 10(j)(2).  section 10(j)(2) provides that § 10(j) immunity shall not apply to ""any claim based upon the intervention of a public employee which causes injury to the victim or places the victim in a worse position than [s]he was in before the intervention.""  the term ""intervention"" is not defined in g. l. c. 258, §§ 1 or 10.  when a statutory term is not specifically defined, we give it the ""usual and accepted meaning, as long as [that] meaning[ is] consistent with the statutory purpose.""  commonwealth v. zone book, inc.,, 369 (1977).  see commonwealth v. gove,, 354-355 (1974).  typically, the usual and accepted meaning of a statutory term can be derived from a source such as a dictionary.  zone book, inc., supra.  the term ""intervention"" is commonly understood to mean ""the act or fact of intervening.""  webster's third new international dictionary 1183 (1993).  in this sense, ""intervention"" refers to an affirmative act on the part of the intervener.  this is how the term has been understood and applied in our appellate decisions.  compare jones v. maloney,, 750 (2009) (""the assistant principal's failure to take various actions, including contacting the [plaintiff's] mother, . . . cannot be considered acts of intervention under § 10[j][2]""), with serrell v. franklin county,, 405 (1999) (§ 10[j][2] exception applicable where affirmative act of pushing iron gate against plaintiff to subdue inmate exacerbated situation to plaintiff's detriment).here, the intervening ""acts"" alleged to fall within the scope of § 10(j)(2) are, rather, plainly omissions.  these include the head coach's failure both to explain to alexandra's father the circumstances of alexandra's injury and to provide advice about how to treat her injury, and the defendant's failure to implement the proper concussion protocols under g. l. c. 111, § 222, and 105 code mass. regs. §§ 201.00 et seq.  thus, the plaintiffs' arguments as to the applicability of § 10(j)(2)'s exception to the exclusion from liability set forth in § 10(j) must also fail.  as we have noted on other occasions and in other contexts involving the scope of statutory remedies, the exception set forth in § 10(j)(2) reflects a policy judgment.  ""if it is unwise, it is not for us to say so; the remedy lies with the legislature.""  murphy v. police commr. of boston,, 471 (1976).  see commonwealth v. vickey,, 767 (1980) (""[w]hen the statute appears not to provide for an eventuality, there is no justification for judicial legislation"").page 2502.  other claims.  the plaintiffs' other claims, all of which stem from the injuries sustained by alexandra during field hockey practice, also were properly dismissed by the motion judge.  see jacome v. commonwealth,, 493

[254-256]this court stated that at the retrial of criminal indictments, a new rule would not bar the admission of an in-court identification of the defendant by an eyewitness who was not present during the commission of the crime and who did not participate in any out-of-court identification procedure, where the eyewitness was familiar with the defendant before the commission of the crimes [256-257]; further, this court declined to consider the defendant's claim that he received a harsher sentence following his convictions at a previous retrial than the one originally imposed, in light of the conclusion that a new trial was required. [257-259]","a middlesex county grand jury returned two indictments charging the defendant, walter crayton, with possession of child pornography in violation of g. l. c. 272, § 29c.  he was charged as a subsequent offender and, therefore, he faced imprisonment for ""not less than five years.""  g. l. c. 272, § 29c(vii).page 252the charges stemmed from the defendant's viewing of child pornography on a computer at the central square branch of the cambridge public library on january 21, 2009.  he was convicted on both indictments and the subsequent offender portion of the first indictment following a bifurcated trial.see g. l. c. 278, § 11a.  the convictions were vacated and a new trial ordered by the supreme judicial court because, among other  reasons, the admission of two in-court showup identifications resulted in unfair prejudice.  see commonwealth v. crayton,(2014) (crayton i).  a new trial was conducted in 2015.  the defendant was again convicted of the underlying offenses by a jury, after which a separate jury convicted him of the second and subsequent offense portion of the first indictment.in this appeal, the defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial judge erred in (1) allotting to each side six peremptory challenges instead of fourteen in connection with the first phase of the trial; (2) admitting in evidence an in-court identification of him by a library employee; and (3) imposing an allegedly harsher sentence than the one imposed following his first trial, in violation of his right not to be placed in double jeopardy.we agree with the defendant that he was deprived of eight peremptory challenges to which he was entitled during the first phase of the trial.  because fourteen jurors were seated pursuant to mass.r.crim.p. 20(d)(1),  378 mass. 889  (1979) (rule 20), and the defendant was charged with a ""crime punishable by imprisonment for life,"" rule 20(c)(1), he was entitled to fourteen peremptory challenges.  commonwealth v. berardi,, 469-470 (2015) (berardi).  where, as here, the error was preserved, a new trial is required.  in light of our conclusion, we briefly address the defendant's remaining claims, as those issues may arise in any retrial.background.  the factual basis for the indictment is described in detail in crayton i, 470 mass. at 230-233, and need not be repeated here.  what follows are the facts surrounding the defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges at his retrial.  at thepage 253beginning of the first phase of the trial, the defendant requested twelve peremptory challenges, or more, depending on the number of jurors seated.  although the commonwealth agreed that the defendant was entitled to additional peremptory challenges, the judge nonetheless denied the request and allotted each side six peremptory challenges for a jury of fourteen (twelve plus two alternates).  the defendant objected and renewed his objection during the empanelment process when, after having exercised five peremptory challenges, he sought additional challenges to exclude jurors 50, 61, and 48.  trial counsel's reasons for wanting to exclude these three jurors were as follows.juror 50, a baptist minister, hesitated when asked whether he would be willing to look at the evidence in order to decide whether it constituted pornography.when trial counsel asked the judge to inquire further, she refused to do so.  trial counsel objected to the denial of her request, but she did not request that juror 50 be excused for cause.  juror 61 worked at a university and was employed as a librarian.  as she had with juror 50, trial counsel asked the judge to inquire further, specifically indicating her concern that the juror's ""role as a librarian"" would affect her ability to be fair and impartial in light of the fact that the offenses allegedly occurred in a library.this request was similarly rebuffed.  lastly, as to juror 48, trial counsel observed that the juror's brother was a law enforcement officer and, although juror 48 ultimately stated that he would not believe a police officer over another witness, he also stated that he trusted his brother.page 254trial counsel expressed her concern over juror 48's ability to remain impartial and reiterated her position that she would exclude all three jurors if she could.  the defendant then used his sixth and last peremptory challenge to remove juror 50, the baptist minister.  jurors 61 and 48 remained seated.  when the judge asked the parties whether they were content with the jury, the prosecutor responded affirmatively, but trial counsel stated, ""i don't have any more challenges.""  when pressed by the judge (""so you're content?""), trial counsel stated twice more that she was out of challenges, requested extra challenges, and explained her reasons.after the verdict was returned, a second jury was empanelled for the second phase of the trial and the judge allotted each side fourteen peremptory challenges.discussion.  1.  peremptory challenges.  the outcome of this case is controlled in all material respects by our decision in berardi.in berardi, we held that a defendant who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of five years, with no specified maximum sentence because he was charged as a subsequent offender, is presumed to face ""imprisonment for life"" and was entitled under rule 20 to ""twelve peremptory challenges of the jurors called to try the case . . . [plus] one additional peremptory challenge for each additional juror"" for the first phase of the trial.88 mass. app. ct. at 469-470.  berardi, a registered sex offender,page 255was indicted for knowingly providing false information on a registration form, in violation of g. l. c. 6, § 178h(a).  he was allotted only five peremptory challenges for the trial on the underlying offense, even though thirteen jurors were empanelled and the judge intended to use the same jury for both phases of the bifurcated trial.despite the ""magnitude of th[is] error,"" we did not reverse the 

conviction because berardi (1) had not preserved the error,and (2) failed to show that he did not receive a fair and impartial jury.  berardi, supra at 474.  berardi used all of his peremptory challenges, but he did not challenge the judge's determination that each seated juror was indifferent.  id. at 472-473.""although the sixth amendment to the united states constitution and art. 12 of the declaration of rights of the massachusetts constitution guarantee the right to be tried by an impartial jury, there is no federal or state constitutional right to exercise peremptory challenges.""  commonwealth v. mello,, 396 (1995).  rather, ""peremptory challenges are a creature of statute,"" and, thus, a defendant is deprived of his constitutional right to an impartial jury ""only if [he] does not receive that which state law provides.""  ross v. oklahoma, 487 u.s. 81, 89 (1988). here, at the time of the defendant's retrial, state law provided that ""[n]o irregularity in . . . [the] impanelling of jurors shall be sufficient to set aside a verdict, unless the objecting party has been injured thereby or unless the objection was made before the verdict.""  berardi, 88 mass. app. ct. at 473, quoting from g. l. c. 234, § 32.as we explained in berardi, ""[n]o prejudice need be shown if the defendant timely objects before the verdict or ifpage 256[his] 'exercise of a peremptory challenge is erroneously denied and the challenged juror is seated on the panel and participates in deciding the case.'""  ibid., quoting from commonwealth v. bockman,, 763 (2004).the defendant in the present case objected multiple times to the reduced number of peremptory challenges and asked for additional ones.  when his requests were denied and he had only one remaining challenge, he set forth his reasons for eliminating three potential jurors.  two of these jurors then were seated after he had exhausted his peremptory challenges.  these factors mandate a result different from the one we reached in berardi.the commonwealth seeks to distinguish berardi on the ground that, whereas only one jury was empanelled in that case, here it was clear from the outset that the judge intended to empanel two separate juries.  this argument is unavailing.  our decision in berardi unequivocally requires that a defendant facing ""imprisonment for life"" as a subsequent offender be allotted an increased number of peremptory challenges at the first phase of the bifurcated proceeding.  see berardi, 88 mass. app. ct. at 470 (""rule 20 does not operate differently in bifurcated trials nor does it apply only to the subsequent offender phase of a bifurcated trial"").  the defendant faced the possibility of life imprisonment when he was placed at bar during the first phase of the trial, and he was entitled under rule 20 to additional peremptory challenges.  id. at 469-470.  to hold otherwise would force a defendant to choose one jury for both phases of a bifurcated trial in order to receive the increased number of peremptory challenges.  we agree with the defendant that such a result would be impracticable, potentially unfair, and inconsistent with rule 20 and g. l. c. 278, § 11a.2.  issues for retrial.  we briefly comment on the defendant's remaining claims.a.  identification.  in crayton i, 470 mass. at 241-242, the supreme judicial court announced a new rule governing the admissibility of in-court identifications of a defendant by eyewitnesses who were present during the commission of the crime but had not participated before trial in an identification procedure.  the rule states that such in-court identifications will be treated as an ""in-court showup,"" admissible ""only where there is 'good reason.'""  id. at 241.  the defendant argues that the judge abused her discretion and ignored the new rule announced in crayton i by allowing ricardo ricard, an eyewitness who was not presentpage 257during the commission of the crime, and did not participate in any out-of-court identification procedure, to make an in-court identification of the defendant.  we disagree.ricard was employed as a senior technician at the library where the offenses occurred.  he testified that the defendant  came to the library once or twice a week to use the computers.  at times when there was a wait list, the defendant used the initial ""w"" to sign up to use a computer.  ricard did not see the defendant using a computer on january 21, 2009, but, after he was informed of an ""incident"" relating to the use of a certain computer, ricard disabled the software on that computer and observed a folder on the computer labeled ""w.""  that folder contained the child pornography the defendant was accused of possessing.  ricard made an in-court identification of the defendant as the same person who used the initial ""w.""we agree with the commonwealth that the new rule announced in crayton i does not bar ricard's in-court identification.the court explicitly stated that the new rule ""shall apply only to in-court identifications of the defendant by eyewitnesses who were present during the commission of the crime.""  crayton i, 470 mass. at 242.  the court did not address whether the new rule ""should apply to in-court identifications of the defendant by eyewitnesses [like ricard] who were not present during the commission of the crime but who may have observed the defendant before or after the commission of the crime.""  id. at 242 n.17.  in any event, the judge did not abuse her discretion in allowing  ricard's in-court identification.  although not required, see commonwealth v. galipeau,, 232 (2018), the judge conducted a voir dire of ricard, after which she properly determined there was ""good reason"" to allow an in-court identification because, based on his interactions with the defendant at the library, ricard was ""familiar with the defendant before the commission of the crime.""  crayton i, supra at 242.b.  sentencing.  following his first trial, the defendant was sentenced on the first indictment to serve from five years to five years and one day in state prison.on the second indictment, he was sentenced to from three years of probation to be served on and after the prison sentence imposed on the first indictment.  aspage 258we have noted, following his convictions at the retrial, the second indictment was dismissed as duplicative.  see commonwealth v. rollins,, 70-75 (2014).  thus, in determining the appropriate sentence after the retrial, the second judge no longer had the option of imposing a term of probation.  the judge imposed a sentence of from five to eight years in state prison, so that the defendant would receive supervision in the event he was paroled.as the judge explained, although the sentence ""may be stricter,"" it provided the opportunity for supervision in the future.  the sentence was affirmed by the appellate division of the superior court.  compare id. at 75 (appropriate remedy for duplicative convictions is to ""vacate the duplicative convictions and remand for resentencing"").the defendant claims that he was subjected to double jeopardy because the sentence imposed after retrial was more severe than the one originally imposed.  assuming without deciding that the defendant received a harsher sentence after his retrial, the principle of double jeopardy is not implicated because the prior sentence did not come about as a ""result of acquittal with respect to an essential element required for imposition of the harsher sentence.""  commonwealth v. jarvis,, 541 (2007), citing sattazahn v. pennsylvania, 537 u.s. 101, 111-112 (2003).  the issue is more properly framed as one concerning the question of judicial vindictiveness.  see commonwealth v. hyatt,, 823 (1995) (the issue of judicial vindictiveness arises from a judge's imposition on reconviction of a sentence more severe  than that imposed after the first trial).  under our common law, ""when a defendant is again convicted of a crime or crimes, the second sentencing judge may impose a harsher sentence or sentencespage 259only if the judge's reason or reasons for doing so appear on the record and are based on information that was not before the first sentencing judge.""  ibid.  although we discern no vindictiveness in the judge's decision to impose a five to eight year state prison sentence, we need not reach the merits of the defendant's claim.  even if we were to agree with the defendant, the proper remedy would be to vacate the sentence.  given our conclusion that a new trial is required, this effectively has already taken place.judgment reversed.verdict set aside.",criminal,Elizabeth M.

(1979), the commonwealth presented the following facts. at 10:15 a.m. on august 3, 2015, taunton police officer brett collins pulled over a kia spectra automobile after ""it failed to stop at [a] stop sign.""  as he approached the vehicle, officer collins saw the defendant, who was the sole occupant of the back seat, turn and look at him.  he also observed a woman in the driver's seat and a man in the front passenger seat.  officer collins recognized the defendant as someone with whom he was familiar, and the two exchanged greetings.  on the seat next to the defendant was a cellular telephone.officer collins obtained identification from the two people in the front compartment of the kia, but not from the defendant.  as officer collins ""ran"" the information in his cruiser, he learned that there was an outstanding warrant for the front seat passenger, michael macnamara.officer collins then noticed that the defendant was out of the kia and walking toward him, holding a cellular telephone.  the defendant told the officer that his son had fallen or was hurt and asked if he could leave.  after getting officer collins's permission, the defendant began walking away from the area where the kia was stopped.  immediately upon the defendant's departure from the scene, macnamara began to yell and gesture toward the rear of the kia, where the backpack containing the firearm eventually was located.  the defendant then began to run and officer collins was unable to catch him.returning to the kia, officer collins found that macnamara had left the scene as well.  the driver, who was still seated, directed the officer to the back of the kia.  on the floor of the back seat, behind the driver, was a backpack.  officer collins opened the backpack, and found a .45 caliber sig sauer p220 handgun, a magazine for the gun, as well as .45 caliber bullets inside a sock that was tied at one end.the following month, on september 1, 2015, the defendant was arrested on a warrant for firearm-related charges arising out of this incident.  the defendant asked what the charges stemmed from.  when advised what they were, the defendant said that ""hepage 262didn't understand why he was being charged with the gun because the person who was in the car with him had a record as long as his"" and had also ""fled like he did.""discussion.  when analyzing whether the record evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, an appellate court is not required to ""ask itself whetherbelieves that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" (emphasis in original).  commonwealth v. velasquez,, 152 (1999), quoting from jackson v. virginia, 443 u.s. 307, 318-319 (1979).  see commonwealth v. hartnett,, 475 (2008).  rather, the relevant ""'question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt' (emphasis in original).""  commonwealth v. latimore, 378 mass. at 677, quoting from jackson v. virginia, supra.  see commonwealth v. pixley,, 630 (2010).here, the commonwealth's case against the defendant was presented on the theory of constructive possession, which requires the commonwealth to establish the defendant's ""knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.""  commonwealth v. sespedes,, 99 (2004), quoting from commonwealth v. brzezinski,, 409 (1989).  a defendant's ""knowledge or intent is a matter of fact, which is often not susceptible of proof by direct evidence, so resort is frequently made to proof by inference from all the facts and circumstances developed at the trial.""  commonwealth v. casale,, 173 (1980).  in constructive possession cases, a defendant's presence alone is not enough to show the ability and ""intention to exercise control over the firearm, but presence, supplemented by other incriminating evidence, 'will serve to tip the scale in favor of sufficiency.'""  commonwealth v. albano,, 134 (1977), quoting from united states v. birmley, 529 f.2d 103, 108 (6th cir. 1976).the defendant relies predominantly on commonwealth v. romero,, 652-659 (2013) (evidence of defendant's presence in automobile, which he owned and in which firearm was being passed around, insufficient to establish constructive possession).  however, while the defendant's presence in the kia itself, ""without more, is not sufficient evidence . . .[,] [p]resence in the same vehicle supplemented by other incriminating evidence, . . . may suffice.""  commonwealth v. sinforoso,,page 263327 (2001), quoting from commonwealth v. garcia,, 686-687 (1991).  here, we have significantly more than mere presence.taken in its totality, the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of the firearm and ammunition, and that he had the ability and intention to exercise control over them.  the defendant was the sole rear seat passenger in the kia spectra.  he was seated behind the front seat passenger and directly adjacent to the backpack, which was on the floor behind the driver.  the defendant's cellular telephone was on the seat next to him, showing some intent to exercise dominion and control over the back seat compartment.  the backpackwas a mere two to three feet from the defendant, well within his reach.he had the most ready access to it.  see commonwealth v. sadberry,, 936 (1998) (gun's location near defendant in car was proper consideration on question of dominion and control).it is a fair inference from macnamara's behavior -- including shouting and yelling to officer collins and pointing to the back of the kia -- that he was reacting to the sudden realization that the defendant, having found a pretext to get permission from officer collins to leave the scene, had left the firearm and ammunition behind.  in fact, a rational fact finder could find that it was macnamara's protestations that caused the defendant to shift from leaving the scene, to fleeing the scene.  such a fact finder also could find that macnamara, by affirmatively and eagerly drawing officer collins's attention to the backpack, made certain that the officer both found the contraband, and knew that they belonged to the defendant.in addition, a rational fact finder could find that the defendant engineered what can reasonably be construed to be a ruse, which allowed him to flee the scene and avoid being connected to the contraband.  ""false statements to police may be considered as consciousness of guilt if there is other evidence tending to prove the falsity of the statements.""  commonwealth v. vick,, 424 (2009), quoting from commonwealth v. robles,, 71 (1996).  here, officer collins allowed the defendant to leave the scene as he claimed he had a hurt or injured child.  however, when officer collins was alerted by macnamara to thepage 264backpack, the defendant ran from the scene and officer collins was unable to see or locate him.  indeed, it took approximately one month for the defendant to be arrested.  the actions of the defendant may reasonably lead to the conclusion that the story of an injured child was just that, a story.the fact that there was an outstanding warrant for the defendant for a motor vehicle violation does not alter the result.  officer collins and the defendant were acquainted with one another and exchanged pleasantries during the initial encounter.  officer collins had not previously arrested the defendant, and there was no reason to believe that the officer was somehow targeting the defendant to arrest him on the outstanding warrant.  officer collins only asked the driver and macnamara for identification, and agreed to let the defendant leave when he asked permission to do so.ultimately, the defendant's claim of an injured child allowed him to flee the scene.  this effort to escape from the kia and to leave the scene is redolent of guilt.  indeed, it is the defendant's behavior after the police arrived that permits an inference of the defendant's intent to exercise dominion and control of the contraband prior to the arrival of the police. contrast commonwealth v. handy,, 781 (1991) (defendant's response to police negated link to contraband).flight is often considered a ""plus"" factor supporting an inference that the occupant intended to exercise dominion and control over the illegal contraband.  see commonwealth v. namey,, 98-102 (2006).  see also commonwealth v. sabetti,, 778 (1992) (evidence of constructive possession sufficient where defendant attempted to flee, demonstrating consciousness of guilt); commonwealth v. jefferson,, 826 (2012) (reasonable jury could infer that defendant fled to throw away contraband that he feared police would find during stop).  it is also notable that of the three people in the kia, the defendant was the only person who initially neither stayed at the scene nor tried to draw the attention of officer collins to the backpack.  constructive possession ""may be inferred from circumstantial evidence which, in terms of practical experience of the conduct of human beings, points to such a finding.""  commonwealth v. brown,, 225 (1993).additionally, the defendant's actions and statements when he was arrested provide a further basis for the fact finder to infer that the defendant constructively possessed the firearm andpage 265ammunition.  the defendant stated that he did not ""understand why he was being charged with the gun, because the person who was in the car with him had a record as long as his"" and had also ""fled like he did.""  from such statements, a rational fact finder could infer that the defendant knew there was a firearm and ammunition in the backpack, and that he possessed it (whether on his own or jointly with one of the other occupants of the kia).  the defendant persisted in his efforts, which began with the pretext at the scene, to blame others or, at the very least, to distance himself from the contraband.  collectively, this evidence provides a ""particular link,"" commonwealth v. boria,, 420 (2003), between the contraband and the defendant.  contrast commonwealth v. romero, 464 mass. at 658 (no additional evidence linking defendant's access to vehicle to firearm inside).  it also constitutes further consciousness of guilt evidence that tips the scale in favor of sufficiency.  see commonwealth v. elysee,, 846-847 (2010) (""nonresponsive and deceptive interactions"" with police were indicative of consciousness of guilt).a rational fact finder, employing common sense, see commonwealth v. drew,, 32 (1976), could reasonably find that the defendant had the requisite ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm and ammunition.  see commonwealth v. mcintosh,, 41 (2010) (""intent to exercise dominion and control can be inferred from the defendant's conduct"").  as has been stated in the context of a joint venture, ""[t]he line that separates mere knowledge of unlawful conduct and participation in it, is 'often vague and uncertain.  it is within the province of the [fact finder] to determine from the evidence whether a particular defendant [has] crossed that line.'""  commonwealth v. longo,, 487 (1988), quoting from commonwealth v. cerveny,, 287 (1982).the combination of the defendant's location in the kia, his adjacency to the backpack, the ruse he created, his flight from the scene, and his statements upon his arrest provides a sufficient basis on which a rational fact finder could infer that the backpack -- and thus the firearm and ammunition -- belonged to the defendant.judgments affirmed.(dissenting, with whom wolohojian and singh, jj., join).  i agree with the majority that, viewed in the light mostpage 266favorable to the commonwealth, the evidence sufficed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the requisite knowledge of the firearm and ammunition and that he had the ability to control those items.  because i conclude that the evidence was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant intended to exercise dominion and control over the firearm and ammunition, i would reverse the convictions.the supreme judicial court has emphasized that, in constructive possession cases, the question whether there is sufficient proof of intent to exercise dominion and control over the weapon or contraband is a distinct inquiry that must be satisfied by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  see commonwealth v. romero,, 653-654 (2013).  romero, like this case, involved the discovery of a firearm in a vehicle with multiple occupants.  the firearm in question was being looked at by the person sitting next to the defendant, who was the driver and owner of the car.  the court held that the defendant's proximity to the firearm in plain view in his own vehicle coupled with evidence that the defendant had handled the firearm earlier in the day supported the inference that the defendant knew of the firearm and had the ability to control it, but did not support an inference that the defendant had the intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm.  ibid.  the court reasoned that, despite the defendant's proximity to the firearm, intent to control could not be inferred from knowledge and the ability to control.  id. at 655-659.as romero demonstrates, where a firearm is found in proximity to multiple individuals in a vehicle but not in the actual possession of any of them, proving that each of them individually (or jointly) intended to exercise dominion and control over the firearm is neither an empty nor necessarily simple exercise.  such intent is generally proven by circumstantial evidence, and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.  id. at 653.for example, this court's cases hold that the intent to exercise dominion and control over a firearm or contraband may be inferred from evidence tending to show a defendant's special connection to the item or to the place where it is located.  see commonwealth v. valentin,, 671 (2002) (defendant's intent to control gun found in open view in backpack in vehicle that defendant was driving inferred where backpack also contained defendant's paystub and work shirt).  contrast commonwealth v. frongillo (no. 1),, 684-686 (2006) (firearms and ammunition found in closets ofpage 267apartment occasionally occupied by defendant warranted inference of knowledge and ability to control but not intent to control).such intent also may be inferred when the defendant makes an attempt to conceal or hide the item in question, or makes a gesture toward it to suggest that he had an intent to exercise control over it.  see commonwealth v. brzezinski,, 410 (1989) (defendant responded to police entry by running into closet containing cocaine and drug paraphernalia); commonwealth v. horton,, 578 (2005) (defendant reached below his leg and kicked at something below driver's seat in front of him where gun was ultimately found); commonwealth v. mcintosh,, 41-42 (2010) (defendant ran to bedroom and proceeded directly to bed where firearm was discovered, and attempted to prevent others from entering room).  contrast commonwealth v. ramos,, 902-903 (2001) (although knowledge of shotgun was established by fact part of it was protruding from under mattress across from where defendant was sitting, neither ability nor intent to control shotgun was established due to absence of personal belongings connecting defendant to premises).here, there was no evidence of a special connection between the defendant and the firearm or its location.  apart from being a passenger in the car, there was no link between the defendant and the vehicle.  moreover, the defendant's only link to the backpack was that it was located on the floor of the back seat within his reach.there was no evidence that the backpack, which was located in an area accessible to all three occupants of the vehicle, and was not open,belonged to the defendant.nor was there evidence that the defendant made any gesture toward the backpackpage 268which would indicate ownership or an attempt to hide or conceal it.despite the absence of evidence connecting the defendant to the firearm, the commonwealth argues that it met its burden of proof because it introduced evidence of the defendant's presence in the car ""supplemented by other incriminating evidence"" from which the fact finder reasonably could infer that the defendant had the intent to control the firearm.  commonwealth v. sinforoso,, 327 (2001) (quotation omitted).  the additional inculpatory evidence on which the commonwealth primarily relies is the behavior of the front seat passenger, michael macnamara, and the defendant's conduct in creating a ruse that enabled him to flee from the scene.even viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, this evidence combined with the defendant's presence in the car and his proximity to the backpack is not sufficient to withstand a motion for a required finding of not guilty.officer collins testified that, while he was obtaining information about the driver and macnamara, the defendant approached his cruiser and informed him that his son fell or was hurt and asked if he could leave.  upon receiving permission to go, the defendant began to walk away as officer collins started to get out of his car.  at this point, macnamara ""hopped"" out of the car, shouted, and made a gesture toward the back of the car.  to be sure, macnamara's behavior demonstrates that he knew of the gun and, as the commonwealth argues, it is reasonable to infer that he did not want to be held responsible for it (hence the reason for his own flight).  however, macnamara's reaction sheds little light on the defendant's intent to control the firearm.  there maypage 269be instances when a defendant's intent may be inferred from the behavior of a codefendant or a joint venturer, but this case does not present one.the most that reasonably can be inferred from macnamara's reaction is his own knowledge of the firearm.this brings me to the defendant's conduct following the stop.  i agree that the evidence supports the inference that the defendant created a ruse so that he could leave and that he did, in fact, flee.  there is no doubt that these facts allow for the inference of consciousness of guilt.but that alone does not suffice.  instead, i must ask whether this evidence reasonably permits the specific inference that the defendant intended to exercise dominion and control over the firearm.  given the limited incriminatory evidence with respect to the defendant, i cannot conclude with confidence that an inference of intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm is reasonable here.  see commonwealth v. sespedes,, 102 (2004), citing commonwealth v. amparo,, 924 (1997) (consciousness of guilt evidence, including flight upon police arrival, may have indicated knowledge of presence of contraband but did not establish intent to control it where there was no established connection between defendant and apartment); commonwealth v. handy,, 781-782 (1991) (defendant's flight from police, away from apartment containing contraband, insufficient to establish intent to control without any other connectionpage 270to apartment).as the commonwealth acknowledges, there was an outstanding warrant for the defendant's arrest at the time the vehicle was stopped.this supports an alternate inference that the defendant fled because of the warrant.  see commonwealth v. fancy,, 201 (1965) (weight attributed to consciousness of guilt evidence weakened considerably by fact of outstanding warrant, giving defendant additional motive for concealing his identity).  it is true that ""[t]o the extent that conflicting inferences are possible from the evidence, 'it is for the jury to determine where the truth lies.'""  commonwealth v. martino,, 272 (1992), quoting from commonwealth v. wilborne,, 245 (1981).  at the same time, however, under the familiar latimore standard, ""to sustain the denial of a directed verdict, it is not enough for the appellate court to find there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; it must find that there was enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt.""  commonwealth v. latimore, 378 mass. at 677-678.  furthermore, ""in carefully defined circumstances, a jury [are permitted] to make an inference based on an inference to come to a conclusion of guilt or innocence.""  commonwealth v. dostie,, 376 (1997).  however, ""a jury may not use conjecture or guesswork to choose between alternative inferences.""  ibid.  in this case, the court does not have conflicting inferences that can be resolved by the fact finder; the court has alternative inferences that can only be resolved by resorting to conjecture and speculation.in sum, i conclude that the commonwealth failed to establish the defendant's intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm and ammunition.  in my view, the evidence in this case is weaker than what was presented in romero and the cases upon which the commonwealth relies. accordingly, the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty should have been allowed.(concurring in the dissent).  although i join in thepage 271dissent, i write separately to express my concern over the majority's use of consciousness of guilt evidence to meet a gap in the essential elements of the crime charged, namely the defendant's intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm and ammunition.  in this case, where the evidence failed to establish the defendant's connection to the backpack containing the firearm and ammunition and also failed to show any manifestation of the defendant's intent to control the contraband, the most powerful evidence the commonwealth presented was the defendant's flight from the scene.see commonwealth v. carrion,, 277 (1990) (""flight is perhaps the classic evidence of consciousness of guilt"").  however, consciousness of guilt ""evidence must be probative of the defendant's feelings of guilt concerning the crime of which he is accused.""  commonwealth v. morris,, 738 (2013), quoting from commonwealth v. villafuerte, 72 mass. app. ct. 908, 908 (2008).here, the defendant fled before the officer gave any indication that he was suspicious of any criminal conduct or had even seen the backpack.  the officer had stopped the kia for a civil motor vehicle infraction and was checking identifications when the defendant made an excuse to leave the area.  arguably, the defendant's flight was more probative of the defendant's desire to avoid apprehension on the outstanding warrant than it was of his knowing possession of the firearm and ammunition in the backpack.see commonwealth v. fancy,, 201 (1965) (weight attributed to consciousness of guilt evidence ""weakened considerably"" by fact of outstanding warrant, giving defendant additional motive for concealing his identity); commonwealth v. handy,, 782 n.6 (1991) (evidence of flight alone is insufficient foundation for conviction, particularly where defendant had at least one other motive for his actions).in any event, the defendant's flight from the scene, even if understood to be related to the firearm and ammunition, cannot make up for an absence of evidence on each of the elements of constructive possession.  while consciousness of guilt evidence may support other evidence of guilt, it may not supplant the evidencepage 272concerning the necessary elements of the crime.  see commonwealth v. mazza,, 400 (1987) (consciousness of guilt evidence cannot obscure failure of proof); commonwealth v. gonzalez,, 413 (2016).   see also united states v. otero-mendez, 273 f.3d 46, 53 (1st cir. 2001) (evidence of flight may be introduced as probative of guilty mind ""if there is an adequate factual predicate creating an inference of guilt of the crime charged"" [quotation omitted]).here, the necessary element of the defendant's intent to exercise dominion and control over the firearm and ammunition was missing.  see commonwealth v. romero,, 653-654 (2013).  the defendant's flight could not be used to meet this gap in the evidence - unless the flight itself allowed for an inference of the defendant's intent to exercise dominion and control.see commonwealth v. salemme,, 602-603 (1985) (defendant's flight could not compensate for absence of evidence as to whether defendant fired shot).  here, the defendant's flight away from the car does not allow a reasonable inference that he intended to control the firearm and ammunition contained within the backpack, which he left behind in the car.see black's law dictionary 594 (10th ed. 2014) (""dominion"" means ""control""); id. at 403 (""control"" means ""to exercise power or influence over"").  see also commonwealth v. whitlock,, 519page 273(1995) (constructive possession requires ""evidence of dominating influence over the contraband"").the commonwealth's case essentially consisted of the defendant's flight from a car from which a closed backpack containing a firearm and ammunition were later recovered.  it is well established that proximity to contraband alone cannot establish all of the elements of possession.  see commonwealth v. albano,, 134 (1977).  a conclusion of constructive possession based on proximity to contraband is ""forged entirely of suspicion.""  commonwealth v. gonzalez,, 240 (1997).  nor can a conviction rest solely on evidence of consciousness of guilt.  see commonwealth v. paniaqua,, 803 n.7 (1992).  this is so because ""there are numerous reasons why an innocent person might flee.""  commonwealth v. toney,, 585 n.6 (1982).see commonwealth v. nadworny,, 371 (1985) (consciousness of guilt evidence is equivocal in nature).where a conviction is premised on these two elements, necessarily involving conjecture, i cannot accept that guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.",criminal,Paula J.

1653,jonathan sinaiko & anothervs.  zoning board of appeals of provincetown & others.,"zoning, by-law, judicial review, board of appeals: decision.in a civil action brought in the superior court challenging the decision of a town's zoning board of appeals (board) upholding the grant of a building permit, the judge erred in affirming the board's determination that a section of the town's zoning by-law designed to limit the size of construction based upon the size of nearby structures did not apply, where the determination was at odds with the by-law's plain language and otherwise unreasonable [278-279]; further, in ordering entry of judgment in favor of the plaintiff abutters, this court concluded that the by-law's provision to exclude the largest and smallest structures in calculating an average building size for a neighborhood should apply only where there are three or more structures to be included in the calculation. [279-282]","defendant stanley sikorski wants to build a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half story single family residence on a vacant lot (lot) in provincetown (town).  at issue is the application of § 2640 of the town zoning by-law (by-law), which regulates the scale of new construction and additions.  despite the fact that § 2640 expressly states that it ""is applicable to all new buildings and all additions in all zoning districts in provincetown,"" the building commissioner and zoning board of appeals (board) concluded that the by-law's proscriptions were inapplicable to thepage 275proposed building here.  in an appeal brought by abutters jonathan sinaiko and camille cabrey (abutters) pursuant to g. l. c. 40a, § 17, a superior court judge upheld the board's decision on cross motions for summary judgment.  the abutters now appeal, arguing that the plain language of § 2640 requires its application here, and that, as applied, the by-law requires sikorski to seek a special permit for his proposed building.  because we agree, we reverse the judgment.background.a.  the by-law.  section 2640 of the by-law regulates building scale.  its express purpose is to preserve the town's existing character of ""buildings that have relatively consistent and harmonious scale within neighborhoods,"" and to prevent the construction of ""[n]ewer buildings, where the appropriate scale has not been maintained, [that] have disrupted the character of the neighborhoods.""  by-law § 2640(b).  to serve these ends, the by-law limits the size of new buildings and building additions that can be constructed.  those limits are keyed to the size of existing structures (measured by volume) that already exist in the relevant area.under the terms of § 2640, a landowner can -- as of right -- build a new structure (or expand an existing structure) that is up to twenty-five percent larger than the average size of existing buildings in the area (referred to in the by-law as the ""neighborhood average"").by-law § 2640(d).  a landowner can seek to construct a larger building than can be built as of right by applying for a special permit from the board.  id. § 2640(e).  the board is vested with broad discretion to grant a special permit where ""the deviation [from the scale allowed as of right] is appropriate and [the proposal] meets one or more of [six enumerated] criteria"" (the specifics of which we reserve for later discussion).  ibid.the details of how the neighborhood average is to be calculated are important.that average is set based on existing structures that lie within 250 feet of the applicable measuring point.  thatpage 276measuring point in turn varies depending on whether the proposal is for new construction or for the expansion of an existing structure.  for new construction, the starting point is ""the center of the parcel,"" while for proposed expansions it is ""the center of the proposed renovation.""  by-law § 2640(c).  generally, all existing structures that lie within 250 feet of the applicable measuring point are to be included, with the qualification that ""the largest and smallest structures"" within that radius are to be excluded.ibid.  thus, the neighborhood average employs a form of what statisticians refer to as a ""trimmed mean.""  see oxford dictionary of statistical terms 412 (6th ed. 2006).b.  the proposed building.  the lot in question is owned by defendant david mayo, but sikorski apparently has agreed to purchase it contingent on his obtaining a building permit.  the lot, which is rectangular, is over one acre in size, but it is exceptionally long and narrow.  specifically, the lot is only forty-nine feet wide, but over 1,000 thousand feet long.  one of the narrow sides fronts on bradford street, with the lot extending north from that street deep into a wooded area.sikorski originally proposed to build a two-family residence at a particular location on the lot.  because of neighborhood opposition to that proposal, sikorski changed it to a single-family home, reduced its size, moved its location on the lot, and modified its design in certain respects.  under the revised proposal, the building would remain a not insubstantial structure.  for example, the building will include two-and-a-half stories-- the maximum allowed in the town-- and comprise 33,810 cubic feet inpage 277volume.the proposed house is to be located at the southern edge of the lot, that is, next to bradford street.  it is undisputed that there are many existing structures in close proximity to that proposed location.  for example, as the abutters pointed out in their appeal to the board, there are approximately sixteen structures that lie within 250 foot of the center of the proposed building, and the average volume of those structures -- not including the largest and smallest -- is 9,250 cubic feet.  thus, the proposed building is over three times larger than what the neighborhood average would have been if that figure were calculated using the actual location of the proposed structure.as noted, however, the neighborhood average for new construction is to be calculated based on the center of the lot, not where the proposed building is in fact to be located.  because of the relatively unusual shape of the lot here, that difference has a significant effect.  there are only two existing buildings that lie within 250 feet of the center of the lot.  those structures have volumes of 8,200 and 4,560 cubic feet, respectively.  thus, if the ordinary mean of those two structures were used (6,380 cubic feet), the proposed structure would be over five times as large (a disparity in scale even greater than if the actual location were used).excluding the two nearby structures from the calculation -- based on their being considered the largest and the smallest of the structures lying within 250 feet of the center of the lot -- left no existing structures on which to base a neighborhood average.  this presented town officials with the conundrum of how to calculate the neighborhood average here.  as evidenced by a ""scratch out"" on the relevant form, an assistant assessor for the town initially calculated the neighborhood average as zero.however, apparently upon further reflection, he concluded that the neighborhood average simply was ""n/a,"" which the parties agree is shorthand for ""not applicable.""  under this interpretation, § 2640 placed no constraints on the size of building that sikorski could build as ofpage 278right.  the building commissioner relied on this interpretation in determining that a building permit should issue.on an appeal brought by the abutters, the board affirmed.  while acknowledging that § 2640 was required ""to be applied to all new buildings,"" the board concluded that in the circumstances of this case, ""there [was] no scale calculation procedure to follow.""  the board also stated that it had taken into consideration that sikorski had redesigned his original proposal to reduce its scale ""in response to previous neighbor objections.""on cross motions for summary judgment, a superior court judge affirmed the board's decision.  he reasoned that § 2640 was ambiguous because it did not address how the neighborhood average was to be calculated in the circumstances of this case.  he then observed that the by-law's purpose was to ""maintain consistent scale among existing buildings,"" and that it did not reference ""preserving undeveloped land in its natural state.""  finally, he concluded that in light of this intent, ""it [was] reasonable for the [b]oard to conclude that where no qualifying structures exist in the 250 foot radius, there is no existing scale which must be protected.""discussion.  to help frame the analysis that follows, we begin with some preliminary observations.  it is important to keep in mind that the abutters make two different arguments.  the first is that the board's interpretation of § 2640 is invalid because it is at odds with that section's plain language and otherwise unreasonable.  the second is that their own proffered interpretation (under which the neighborhood average here had to be taken as zero) must be accepted.  these contentions, while related, are conceptually distinct.  as elucidated below, it is possible to conclude that the interpretation offered by the board is untenable without concluding that the abutters' particular counter interpretation necessarily is required.overall, this case raises two inquiries.  one is whether the building scale by-law applies.  the other is, if so, how it applies (that is, how the neighborhood average here should be determined).  the first question is addressed by the plain language of the by-law, which begins with the edict that the by-law ""is applicable to all new buildings and all additions in all zoning districts in provincetown.""by-law § 2640(a).  that language is binding on the board, and the board therefore is not free topage 279determine that the by-law simply is inapplicable.  see macgibbon v. board of appeals of duxbury,, 640 (1970) (board of appeals could not adopt interpretation of by-law where its plain language provided ""no basis for such an interpretation"").  cf. warcewicz v. department of envtl. protection,, 550 (1991) (""[c]ourts will not hesitate to overrule agency interpretations [of their own regulation] when those interpretations are arbitrary, unreasonable, or inconsistent with the plain terms of the regulation itself"").having resolved that § 2640 applies, we now turn to the second inquiry:  how the neighborhood average is to be calculated in the circumstances presented.  as noted, the board concluded that the by-law places no limits on the proposed building's size.  as the abutters point out, having rejected a neighborhood average of zero, the board effectively set that average at infinity instead.the results of the board's interpretation are highly anomalous:  how can it be that a proposed new building is exempt from regulation under a generally-applicable building scale by-law no matter how large that building would be?  in addition, by exempting a structure that in fact grossly exceeds the scale of other buildings in the area, the board's interpretation flies in the face of the by-law's directive that ""[a]ll new buildings or additions shall comply with appropriate scale to their neighborhood.""  by-law § 2640(b).  even to the extent that the judge was correct that the by-law is ambiguous with regard to how the neighborhood average should be interpreted in the circumstances of this case, the board's resolution of that ambiguity was not reasonable.  see britton v. zoning bd. of appeals of gloucester,, 72 (2003), quoting from macgibbon v. board of appeals of duxbury, 356 mass. at 639 (zoning board decision will be overturned if ""based on a legally untenable ground or it is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary"").  see also pelullo v. croft,, 909 (2014) (""[a]court owes deference to the interpretation of a zoning by-law by local officials only when that interpretation is reasonable"").page 280in contrast, the abutters' alternative interpretation is based on an arguably straightforward application of the by-law's language:  where there are no buildings in the relevant neighborhood, the neighborhood average is zero.  moreover, their interpretation does not mean that sikorski necessarily will be unable to build his desired house, but only that he will have to seek a special permit to do so.  the by-law delegates to the board broad discretion to grant case-by-case exemptions from the by-law's strict application.at the same time, the abutters' interpretation produces its own anomalies.  how can it be, for example, that a landowner who has proposed to construct a new structure in an area populated by numerous other existing structures nevertheless be burdened by a neighborhood average of zero (and thereby be forced to seek apage 281special permit) no matter how small his proposed structure may be?  in addition, as a matter of mathematics, trying to divide zero by zero is an endeavor destined to produce an indeterminate result.thus, it is apparent that if the board's available choices for setting the neighborhood average were limited to zero and infinity, there are anomalies either way.  that realization should have caused the town officials to question whether they were limited to these two problematic options.  in other words, could there be a third interpretation that better fit with both the letter and intent of the by-law?  cf. reade v. secretary of the commonwealth,, 578 (2015), quoting from watros v. greater lynn mental health & retardation assn.,, 113 (1995) (""[i]t is a well-established canon of statutory construction that a strictly literal reading of a statute should not be adopted if the result will be to thwart or hamper the accomplishment of the statute's obvious purpose, and if another construction which would avoid this undesirable result is possible"").  one does not have to look far to find such an interpretation.here, the building commissioner ended up with no existing structures on which to determine a neighborhood average only because he excluded the two existing structures that in fact are located within 250 feet of the center of the lot.  the obvious question is whether the terms of § 2640 required him to do so.  the only apparent reason for the by-law's relying on a trimmed mean instead of an ordinary ""arithmetic mean"" is to try to avoid the problem of outliers unduly skewing the resulting average.  see oxford dictionary of statistical terms 412 (idea of trimmed mean is ""[to reduce] the sensitivity of the arithmetic mean to extreme observations"").in other words, excluding values at either end is done based on the theory that doing so may yield a more representative center value.  here, the exclusion of the only two available data points had the opposite result:  it left a null set, which in turn presented town officials with having to choose between zero and infinity as the operative neighborhood average.page 282nothing in the language of § 2640 compelled the building commissioner to exclude existing structures when doing so would leave him without a basis upon which to set a neighborhood average.in fact, the specific language of the by-law cuts in the other direction.  that is because the terms ""largest"" and ""smallest"" that appear in the by-law properly are used only in relation to three or more items (for two items, ""larger"" and ""smaller"" would be proper).  see by-law § 2640(c); chicago manual of style § 5.86, at 253 (17th ed. 2017) (""a superlative adjective expresses the relationship between at least three things and denotes an extreme of intensity or amount in a particular shared quality"").  thus, under a grammatically correct reading of the by-law's plain language, the directive that the building commissioner exclude the ""largest"" and ""smallest"" structures in calculating a neighborhood average would apply only where there are three or more structures within 250 feet of the applicable measuring point.  see generally commonwealth v. wright,, 86 (2015) (""in interpreting legislation, we employ familiar canons of statutory and grammatical interpretation"").  applying such an interpretation here, the two structures within 250 feet of the applicable measuring point would not be excluded in calculating the neighborhood average.conclusion.  in sum, we agree with the abutters both that the by-law applies to the proposed building and that the board unreasonably interpreted how it applies.  although the particular counter-interpretation proposed by the abutters has its own problems, there is at least one interpretation of the by-law that accords with both its language and express purpose.the proposed building is too large to be approved under that interpretation without a special permit.with none of the defendants having offered a reasonable interpretation of the by-law under which the proposed building could be constructed as a matter of right, we reverse the judgment.  a new judgment shall enter in favor of the abutters.so ordered.",civil,Robert C.

1654,adoption of lisette (and a companion case).,"adoption, care and protection, dispensing with parent's consent.  minor, adoption.  parent and child, adoption, dispensing with parent's consent to adoption.  evidence, medical record.in a proceeding on two care and protection petitions, the judge did not err in admitting in evidence an affidavit from the program manager of an inpatient rehabilitation treatment program regarding the mother's discharge from that program, where there were available no other effective methods of obtaining the program discharge information, and where the children's interests in being free from abuse and neglect substantially outweighed any unlikely injury to the mother from the limited disclosure of confidential information. [287-292]in a proceeding on two care and protection petitions, the judge's findings of fact supported his determination that the mother was unfit, and he connected his findings regarding her unfitness to the risk of harm to the children should they be returned to her custody; further, in terminating the mother's parental rights, the judge did not err in concluding that the mother remained unfit to care for the children and that her unfitness was likely to continue indefinitely. [292-297]","in this case, we are called on to balance two compelling interests:  the need to protect the privacy of persons seeking drug rehabilitation treatment from having their treatment records disclosed against their will, and the crucial need to protect children from abuse and neglect and promote their best interests.  we conclude that under the limited circumstances of this case, the best interests of the children outweigh the mother's right to confidentiality in information concerning her treatment.page 285following a trial in the juvenile court in 2016, the judge found the mother unfitto care for her two children, lisette and adam, and that termination of her parental rights was in their best interests.  see g. l. c. 119, § 26; g. l. c. 210, § 3.  on appeal, the mother contends that the judge erred by (1) ordering the drug rehabilitation program in which she was enrolled to produce an affidavit giving the reasons for her departure from that program; and (2) failing to find a nexus between her ""shortcomings"" and a risk of harm to the children.  we affirm the decrees entered by the juvenile court judge terminating the mother's parental rights.background.  the following facts found by the judge are amply supported by the record.in 2007, the mother gave birth to lisette.  the mother and lisette's biological father were in a relationship at the time, but are no longer together.the mother later began a relationship with adam's father, and adam was born in december of 2013.the mother continued to have an on-and-off relationship with adam's father up through the time of trial.the mother has an extensive history with the department of children and families (department), and a long history of substance abuse and domestic violence.  she ""has a consistent pattern of abusing heroin and failing to engage in services to help her maintain her sobriety.""  she tested positive for opiates when admitted to the hospital prior to adam's birth in december of 2013, and tested positive for benzodiazepines in january of 2014.  the mother also admitted that she used cocaine from september of 2015 until she enrolled, just before trial, in a rehabilitation program in march of 2016.the mother also has a history of domestic violence with both of the children's fathers.  in july of 2014, police responded to the mother's home for reports of a domestic disturbance between herpage 286and adam's father.  one month later, the mother obtained a g. l. c. 209a restraining order against adam's father, stating in her affidavit that he spit in her face, grabbed her throat and choked her, then grabbed her hair and threatened to kill her.  after she locked him out of the house, he tried to reenter through a window.  when the mother tried to stop him, he pulled her halfway out the window by her hair.  on another occasion, the mother testified that adam's father tied her up with an electric cord.  despite her reported concerns about adam's father and her active restraining order against him, the mother continued to allow him in her home.  the department filed a care and protection petition on behalf of lisette after receiving a report that lisette found adam's father in the mother's bed.  after a temporary custody hearing, the judge granted the department custody of lisette, and she has remained in the department's custody since then.adam first came to the department's attention in december, 2013, at just five days old.  he was born when the mother was twenty-six weeks pregnant, and he tested positive for methadone at birth.  the mother also tested positive for methadone and opiates when she arrived at the hospital to give birth to adam.  adam was diagnosed with klinefelter syndrome, a rare condition characterized by an xxy chromosome, resulting in medical and behavioral complications including delayed speech, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems.  due to his premature birth and his diagnosis of klinefelter syndrome, adam presented with challenging medical issues necessitating numerous specialty appointments.  these conditions caused feeding problems requiring a special formula and special bottle nipples so he could eat.the hospital set up training for the mother to teach her how to make adam's special formula.  when the mother failed to attend, the hospital rescheduled the training to the following day.  the mother arrived late to the training, and she failed to purchase the necessary bottle nipples.  the mother then failed to show up for another training session.  prior to adam's expected discharge, the hospital encouraged the mother to spend more time at the hospital to ensure that she learned his proper care.  the hospital's social worker described the mother's visits as ""infrequent and sporadic.""  the hospital social worker informed the department that the mother failed to provide a prescription for adam's seizure medication, failed to provide the special bottle nipples for his feedings, and failed to provide his insurance information.  several days later, the department filed a care and protection petition forpage 287adam and took emergency custody of him.  following his hospital discharge, the department placed him in foster care, where he remains.during trial, the department learned that the inpatient rehabilitation treatment program (program) where the mother had been enrolled had discharged her.  the department subpoenaed the mother's program records relating to the reasons for her discharge.  citing the patient confidentiality provisions set forth in 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2 (2012), the program manager objected to the department's subpoena.  at a hearing on the program manager's objection, the judge suggested -- as a less intrusive alternative -- that he order the program manager to prepare an affidavit limited to the circumstances of the mother's discharge.  the parties, including the mother's counsel, agreed,and the next day the program manager submitted the affidavit,which the judge admitted in evidence over the mother's objection.  the mother contends that the judge admitted the program manager's affidavit in violation of the confidentiality provisions of 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2.discussion.  1.  disclosure of treatment records.  title 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2(a) provides that ""[r]ecords of the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of any patient which are maintained in connection with the performance of any program or activity relating to substance abuse education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research, which is conducted, regulated, or directly or indirectly assisted by any department or agency of the united states shall . . . be confidential. . . .""  the broad purposepage 288of the statute is to protect the confidentiality of persons seeking treatment for substance abuse.  see whyte v. connecticut mut. life ins. co., 818 f.2d 1005, 1010 (1st cir. 1987).however, while the statute protects treatment records and their content from disclosure absent patient consent, congress recognized that in limited circumstances, release of protected information might be necessary.  see 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2(b); 42 c.f.r. § 2.64 (1987).  one such circumstance is where disclosure is ""authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause therefor.""  42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(c).  regulations promulgated pursuant to that statute require that a court's determination of ""good cause"" be based on two findings:  ""(1) other ways of obtaining the information are not available or would not be effective; and (2) the public interest and need for the disclosure outweigh the potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient relationship and the treatment services.""  42 c.f.r. § 2.64(d).  if good cause is established, thepage 289court must limit disclosure to those portions of the records that are ""essential to fulfill the objective of the order.""  42 c.f.r. § 2.64(e).  in addition, 42 c.f.r. § 2.61(a) (1987) provides that ""[a]n order of a court of competent jurisdiction entered under this subpart is a unique kind of court order.  its only purpose is to authorize a disclosure or use of patient information which would otherwise be prohibited by 42 u.s.c. [§] 290dd-2 and the regulations in this part.  such an order does not compel disclosure.  a subpoena or a similar legal mandate must be issued in order to compel disclosure.  this mandate may be entered at the same time as and accompany an authorizing court order entered under the regulations in this part.""a.  other available effective methods.  our first task is to determine whether there was another available effective way to obtain the program discharge information other than by affidavit based on facts derived from the mother's program records.  in its subpoena to the program manager, the department sought ""[a]ny documents and information regarding the discharge of [the mother].""  at the hearing on the program manager's objection to the subpoena, the department's counsel made clear that the department sought only information about the circumstances of the mother's discharge from the program and any documentation relating to that narrow issue.  the judge determined that an affidavit narrowly tailored to the reasons for the mother's discharge would sufficiently cover the issue the department sought to explore at trial.  counsel for both the mother and the program agreed that an affidavit so limited would be preferable to disclosing any of the mother's treatment records.on appeal, the mother maintains that the department had other sources from which to obtain this evidence, namely, either her own testimony or the testimony of the department's social worker assigned to the mother's case.  in making her argument, the mother overlooks significant evidentiary obstacles.  testimony from the department social worker about what the program's staff told her about the mother's discharge would constitute inadmissible hearsay.,see generally mass. g. evid. § 801 (2018).  furthermore, putting aside the hearsay problem, even were thepage 290mother to authorize the program to disclose to the department's social worker the details of the mother's discharge, regulations promulgated under 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2 would bar the social worker from redisclosing that information in court, without the mother's consent.  see 42 c.f.r. § 2.32(a)(1) (1987) (disclosures made with patient's consent must be accompanied by notice stating that ""federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record"").  with regard to the mother's testimony explaining her discharge, the judge determined that absent an independent source, he doubted he could rely on the mother's testimony alone.  this decision was well within the judge's discretion.  see care & protection of three minors,, 711 (1984) (judge is not required to view evidence from mother's perspective).  thus, we agree with the judge that there was no available effective way for the department to provide evidence of the circumstances surrounding the mother's discharge from the program, other than through the program manager's affidavit.b.  need for disclosure.  having concluded that other than obtaining the program manager's affidavit, there existed no effective means for the department to obtain admissible evidence of the circumstances of the mother's program discharge, we turn to the second step of 42 c.f.r. § 2.64(d):  weighing the public interest and need for disclosure against the potential injury to the mother, the physician-patient relationship, and the treatment program.  in assessing the public interest, our courts have long held that in care and protection matters, the interests of a child in being free from abuse and neglect, and the commonwealth's interests in protecting the child's welfare, outweighs the concerns of the parent.  see custody of a minor,, 749 (1978), quoting from purinton v. jamrock,, 199 (1907) (""[w]here a child's well-being is placed in issue, 'it is not the rights of the parents that are chiefly to be considered.  the first and paramount duty is to consult the welfare of the child'""); care & protection of robert,, 62 (1990) (""the child's interest in freedom frompage 291abusive or neglectful behavior, however, is absolute.  in no situation may a child be legitimately subjected to abusive or neglectful conditions"").the need for the narrowly tailored evidence explaining the mother's discharge from the program also supports disclosure.  the purpose of care and protection proceedings is ""to insure the rights of any child to sound health and normal physical, mental, spiritual and moral development.""  g. l. c. 119, § 1, as amended by st. 2008, c. 176, § 82.  here, the judge decided that evidence of the circumstances of the mother's discharge from the treatment program was an important component of his fitness determination, and concluded that, ""because the underlying allegations involve a significant repetitive history of substance abuse and her failure to engage in services that would remedy the circumstances that led to the filing of this care and protection [petition], i have to find that there is good cause for a disclosure of the records.""  thus, both the public interest and the need for the judge to learn the circumstances of the mother's program discharge weigh heavily in favor of disclosure.in contrast, any risk of injury to the mother, to the physician-patient relationship, and to the treatment program, is negligible.  as the judge noted, the private nature of a juvenile court proceeding, and the fact that the records of the proceedings below are impounded and therefore not open to indiscriminate public inspection, minimizes the likelihood of the mother's treatment becoming a matter of public record.  see g. l. c. 119, § 38; g. l. c. 210, § 5c.  in addition, any impact on the mother's physician-patient relationship with the program is, at best, minimal because her treatment at that program had already ended by the time the department subpoenaed her records.  nor can she credibly contend that releasing the limited information derived from her records deterred her from seeking treatment elsewhere, since she subsequently identified a different program in which she intended to enroll.  finally, the mother herself opened the door to an explorationpage 292of her program compliance by testifying that she was in substantial compliance with its rules.  and, as counsel for the parties agreed, the program manager's narrowly focused affidavit explaining the reasons for her discharge was preferable to the release of any of her treatment records.  this limited disclosure, combined with the program's zealous protection of its patients' rights in contesting the department's subpoena, minimizes any risk of injury to the program.because the interests of the children in being free from abuse and neglect substantially outweigh any unlikely injury to the mother from this limited disclosure of confidential information, we conclude that the judge had good cause to order the program manager to disclose by affidavit the reasons for the mother's discharge from her treatment program, in accordance with 42 u.s.c § 290dd-2.see adoption of virgil,, 305 (2018).2.  determination of unfitness and termination of parental rights.  the mother also argues that the judge erred in his unfitness conclusion because he failed to connect the unfitness finding to any risk of harm to the children.  we review the decision of the judge to determine whether there was any abuse of discretion or error of law.  adoption of hugo,, 225 (1998), cert. denied sub nom. hugo p. v. george p., 526 u.s. 1134 (1999).  we review findings of fact under the familiar ""clearly erroneous"" standard.  see adoption of adam,, 924 (1986);

""[t]he critical question is whether the natural parents are currently fit to further the welfare and best interests of the child.""  bezio v. patenaude,, 576 (1980).  the parental unfitness test and the best interests of the child test are not mutually exclusive, but rather reflect different degrees of emphasis on the same factors.  see adoption of kimberly,, 528 (1993).we disagree with the mother's contention that the judge's findings of fact do not support his determination that she is unfit, and that he failed to connect his findings regarding her unfitness to any risk of harm to the children.  on the contrary, the judge explicitly connected his findings to the risk of harm to the children should they be returned to her custody.  specifically, the judge found that ""[the mother] has also failed to adequately address the domestic violence in the home or complete a domestic violence program.""  he found that she ""was involved in several abusive relationships and suffered vicious beatings at the hands of her abusers.""  however, despite vowing to end her abusive relationships and even obtaining a restraining order against adam's father, she continued to associate with him on numerous occasions.  finding that ""[t]here is no evidence that [the mother] completed any domestic violence program or would not repeat this vicious cycle again,"" the judge concluded, ""[the mother's]page 294inability to extricate herself from these abusive relationships bears on her ability to protect the subject children from the grievous type of harm.""  see adoption of zak,, 543 (2015), quoting from custody of vaughn,, 595, 599 (2015) (""[w]itnessing domestic violence, as well as being one of its victims, has a profound impact on children. . . .  [a] child who has been either the victim or the spectator of such abuse suffers a distinctly grievous kind of harm"").with regard to drug abuse, the judge concluded that ""[the mother] has longstanding addiction issues and has relapsed several times prior to and since the initiation of these petitions.""  he also found that ""[i]n over two years since [adam] has been removed from her custody, [the mother] has not been able to complete a substance abuse program,"" and that when she did enroll in such a program, the program terminated her for noncompliance after only ten weeks.  the judge did not credit the mother's testimony that she had been drug-free since 2003 and that she only started abusing drugs again once the department removed the children from her care.  that testimony conflicted with evidence of positive drug tests in december of 2013 and january of 2014, as well as an incident in september of 2015 when police found her incoherent with ""track marks"" on her arms.  finally, the judge noted that the mother failed to complete a substance abuse treatment program, having enrolled in a program shortly before trial some two years after the removal of the children.  he concluded that ""[the mother] has not taken action to remedy . . . her repeated drug use . . . and is unable to see how these issues negatively [a]ffect the subject children. . . .  [the m]other has clearly demonstrated an enduring inability to parent the subject child[ren].""as to adam, the judge again connected his findings to the risk of harm to the child.  specifically, he found that ""[adam] has substantial medical and emotional needs due to his premature birth and genetic condition.""  the judge also found that ""[thepage 295mother] does not fully understand the scope of his medical issues as she did not think that it was important to meet with his dieticianor obtain the necessary feeding implements and stated to the court investigator that the [d]epartment was making it seem like he was sicker than he was.""  he concluded, ""[the mother] has little understanding of [the child's] substantial medical issues, and developmental delays and is unwilling and/or unable to provide the constant supervision and consistency for his social, emotional, and physical well-being.""  the record well supports these findings.  see adoption of oliver,, 625-626 (1990) (parental unfitness can be established where child has substantial needs requiring extraordinary attentiveness from caregiver and where parent has little or no understanding of those needs, or willingness or ability to meet them);

[301-303]in a proceeding on a care and protection petition, the judge did not err in admitting in evidence the mother's drug abuse treatment records, where the child's interests in the care and protection proceedings outweighed any potential injury that the mother might face from disclosure of such records; further, although it would have been better practice to have given the mother more advance notice of the motions seeking disclosure of the records and an opportunity to be heard, the mother was not prejudiced, where she was in open court at the time of the filing of the motions and had ample time to file appropriate motions, and where she later waived any possible objection by testifying about the contents of the records at trial.

[306-307]","the mother appeals from a decree of the juvenile court finding the child to be in need of care and protection, terminating her parental rights to the child, and declining to order posttermination and postadoption visitation.the mother argues that the judge erroneously found a nexus between the mother's substance abuse, poverty, and homelessness, and her ability to provide minimally adequate care of the child.  the mother additionally argues that the judge erroneously admitted and relied upon her substance abuse treatment records in reaching his findings.  we affirm.background.  we summarize the relevant facts and procedural history as set forth in the judge's decision and as supported by the record.  the child, virgil, was born in february, 2010.  the department of children and families (department) first became involved with the mother and virgil in august of 2014 when virgil's pediatrician filed a g. l. c. 119, § 51a, report (51a report) alleging the mother's neglect of virgil.  the report specifically alleged that the mother was unable to attend to virgil's hygiene due to her severe depression.within the same month, another 51a report was filed alleging ""deplorable conditions"" in the mother's apartment.  that report alleged that there were flies everywhere, trash on the floor and on the kitchen stove, and a strong odor of cat urine.  both 51a reports were supported by the department.during an investigation conducted by the department, virgil's doctor's office reported that the mother was inconsistent with virgil's medical care, missing more than twenty scheduled appointments for virgil.  in september, 2014, the mother was charged with larceny pursuant to a single scheme of an amount over $250.  in october, 2014, the mother was evicted from her apartment.  using funds provided by compass for kids, the mother moved to a new apartment.  during that same month, the mother was arrested for open warrants pertaining to previous motor vehicle and larceny charges.  the department waspage 300notified after the mother was unable to make arrangements for virgil at the time of her arrest.  after the mother posted bail, an emergency response worker from the department accompanied the mother to her new apartment to determine its suitability.  the emergency response worker observed old food on the counters, dirty dishes piled in the sink, overflowing trash, black trash bags piled around the apartment, and clothes strewn throughout.  on november 28, 2014, a department social worker made an unannounced visit to the mother's apartment.  upon arriving, the social worker heard the mother screaming and yelling obscenities at virgil.  once inside the apartment, the social worker observed that the apartment was ""filthy,"" filled with trash, piles of clothes, and broken items.  the department removed virgil from the mother's care that same day due to the mother's mental health issues and the apartment's condition.on december 1, 2014, the department filed a petition with the juvenile court, pursuant to g. l. c. 119, § 24, asserting that virgil was in need of care and protection.  the department was granted emergency temporary custody.  the mother thereafter signed a service plan with the department but ultimately was unable to complete any of the service plan tasks.  starting in june of 2015, the mother failed to attend any of the scheduled visits with virgil.  on august 18, 2015, the department filed its notice of intent to seek termination of the mother's parental rights to virgil.in september, 2015, the mother was referred to habit opco, a drug abuse treatment facility, after she had been admitted to lawrence general hospital for a drug overdose.  upon admission to habit opco, the mother tested positive for opiates, cocaine, and buprenorphine.  the habit opco drug abuse treatment records indicate that the mother informed counsellors that she started using opiates five years prior to her admission and heroin four months prior, and that she was currently using two bags of heroin daily.  from march of 2015 to march of 2016, the mother was in and out of several shelters, was arrested for trespassing, and was reprimanded by, as well as asked to leave, various shelters for aggressive behavior.  on march 16, 2016, the mother entered a drug treatment program at women's view, where it was noted that she had a significant risk of relapse.  on april 8, 2016, in the middle of trial, the mother was arrested and charged with breaking and entering.  a few days after her arrest she was allowed to reenter a shelter, where she tested positive for benzodiazepines.on or about december 4, 2015, and march 30, 2016, thepage 301department filed motions for disclosure of the mother's substance abuse treatment records from habit opco and women's view, respectively; both motions were allowed.  after a seven-day trial,the judge found the mother unfit and the child in need of care and protection, terminated the mother's parental rights, and declined to order posttermination and postadoption visitation.discussion.  1.  termination of parental rights.  in order to terminate a parent's rights, the department must first prove and the judge must find, based upon the record evidence, that the parent is currently unfit to further the best interests and welfare of the child, and, as a result, the child is in need of care and protection.  see custody of a minor,, 766 (1983); adoption of ramona,, 262-263 (2004).  a determination of parental unfitness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence, and the subsidiary findings upon which such unfitness determination is based must be ""proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence.""adoption of helen,, 859 (1999).  the judge must not only find that the parent is currently unfit, but must also find that the current parental unfitness is not a temporary condition.  see adoption of jacques,, 610 (2012).  the determination of parental unfitness is not focused on whether the parent is a good one, but rather ""whether the parent is so bad as to place the child at serious risk of peril from abuse, neglect, or other activity harmful to the child.""  adoption of leland,, 584 (2006), quoting from care & protection of bruce,, 761 (1998).  ""parental unfitness means . . . more than ineptitude, handicap, character flaw, conviction of a crime, unusual life style or inability to do as good a job as the child's foster parent. . . .  '[p]arental unfitness' means 'grievous shortcomings or handicaps' that put the child's welfare much at hazard.""  adoption of leland, supra, quoting from adoption of katharine,, 28 (1997).  a judge, however, need not wait for disaster to happen but may rely upon past patterns of parental neglect or misconduct in determining current or future fitness.  see custody of a minor (no. 1),, 882-883 (1979);page 302care & protection of stephen,, 152 (1987); adoption of george,, 268 (1989); adoption of jenna,, 744 (1992).next, in this bifurcated analysis, if a judge finds that the parent is currently unfit and that such unfitness is not a temporary condition, termination of parental rights requires the additional finding that such termination is in the child's best interests.""after ascertaining unfitness, the judge must determine whether the parent's unfitness is such that would it be in the child's best interests to end all legal relations between the parent and child.""  adoption of nancy,, 515 (2005).  in making that determination, ""the court shall consider the ability, capacity, fitness and readiness of the child's parents . . . to assume parental responsibility,"" as well as the plan proposed by the department.  g. l. c. 210, § 3(c), as amended by st. 1999, c. 3, § 17.""a judge, when deciding whether to dispense with consent to adoption [i.e., termination of parental rights], must focus on the present circumstances of the parent and the child, taking into account recent positive gains (if any), and, in appropriate cases, the likelihood of future improvement, in a parent's ability to care for the child.  predictions must be supported by credible evidence, meaning they must be more than hypothetical.  a judge may not decline to dispense with consent based on a faint hope that the family will succeed if reunited.  evidence of future fitnessto dispense with consent to adoption than in a care and protection case.  an estimate about the future rests on a more solid basis for justifying a temporary remedy ([such as] keeping the child under care and protection) than for an irrevocable one such as dispensing with consent to adoption"" (emphasis supplied).  adoption of inez,, 723 (1999) (quotations and citation omitted).  ""in determining whether that extreme step [of terminating parental rights] should be taken, consideration of the future is a necessity.""  adoption of carlos,, 350 (1992).  see adoption of jacques, 82 mass. app. ct. at 610.  ""consideration of future fitness, however, should never be made at the expense of the child, whose interest is paramount.""  adoption of inez, supra.here, the mother argues that the judge erroneously determinedpage 303her to be unfit and subsequently terminated her parental rights based upon her homelessness and her inability to gain employment, and that the judge should not have considered her frequent change of housing because such ensuing instability did not occur while she was living with virgil.  while homelessness, poverty, and financial instability alone are not  sufficient to terminate a person's parental rights, they are proper considerations in an unfitness determination.  see care & protection of three minors,, 713 & n.12 (1984); petitions of the dept. of soc. servs. to dispense with consent to adoption,, 289 (1987) (failure to maintain stable living arrangement or to maintain financial stability are proper considerations in unfitness determination).  moreover, contrary to the mother's argument, it is proper for a judge to consider a parent's living arrangements at the time of trial despite the fact that the child was not living with her at that time.  furthermore, in addition to the mother's housing and financial struggles, the judge also thoroughly considered the mother's ongoing substance abuse issues, her emotional and mental instability, her inability to attend to virgil's hygiene (which affected his health and well-being), her past patterns of parental neglect and misconduct, her failure to engage in remedial services, and her criminal activity.  the record reveals that the judge gave close and careful consideration to all the evidence presented before making his findings, none of which we find to be clearly erroneous.2.  drug abuse treatment records.  relying on 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2 (2012),the mother next argues that the judge improperly admitted and relied upon inadmissible evidence contained in her drug abuse treatment records.  we disagree.the general purpose of 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2 is to protect the confidentiality of drug abuse treatment records.  see whyte v. connecticut mut. life ins. co., 818 f.2d 1005, 1010 (1st cir. 1987).  however, both the statute and the applicable regulationspage 304recognize situations in which release is necessary.such a situation exists ""[i]f authorized by an appropriate order of a court of competent jurisdiction granted after application showing good cause therefor.""  42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(c).  good cause exists only if:  ""(1) [o]ther ways of obtaining the information are not available or would not be effective; and (2) [t]he public interest and need for the disclosure outweigh the potential injury to the patient, the physician-patient relationship and the treatment services.""  42 c.f.r. § 2.64(d) (1987).the mother does not appear to be challenging whether there was good cause to disclose her drug abuse treatment records.while we have not yet explicitly held that disclosure of a parent's drug abuse treatment records in a care and protection case meets the requirement of ""good cause,"" we have long held that ""where a child's well-being is placed in issue, 'it is not the rights of the parents that are chiefly to be considered.  the first and paramount duty is to consult the welfare of the child.'""  custody of a minor,, 749 (1978), quoting from purinton v. jamrock,, 199 (1907).  the united states supreme court has addressed this issue and concluded that ""[t]he dependent child's needs are paramount, and only with hesitancy would we relegate those needs, in the scale of comparative values, to a position secondary to what the mother claims as her rights.""  wyman v. james, 400 u.s. 309, 318 (1971).  other jurisdictions have specifically addressed this question.page 305we see no reason not to extend such logic to the disclosure of a parent's drug treatment records in a care and protection case.  a child's interests in these proceedings outweigh any potential injury that the parent might face from disclosure of his or her drug treatment records.  any interest a parent may have in the confidentiality of treatment records must give way to the interests of a child in being protected from physical, mental, or emotional harm, as well as the interests of the commonwealth, as parens patriae, in protecting the child's welfare.  here, because of the mother's significant history of drug abuse, her participation, or lack thereof, in her various treatment programs was highly relevant to the judge's determination of her current and future fitness as well as the child's best interests. see adoption of lisette,, 292 (2018).in addition to a showing of good cause, 42 c.f.r. § 2.64(e) (1987) requires that an order of disclosure limit the ""disclosure to those parts of the patient's record which are essential to fulfill the objective of the order.""  here, the judge stated in his orders allowing the department's motions that ""[t]he safety and best interests of the child in this matter constitutes good cause, within the meaning of 42 u.s.c. § 290dd-2(b)(2)(c) to order disclosure of these records"" and that the ""records are subject to limited confidentiality under g. l. c. 111e, § 18 and 42 u.s.c. § 290dd et seq.""  we see no error.finally, the mother argues that she did not receive adequate notice to respond to the department's motions seeking disclosure of her drug abuse treatment records, as required by 42 c.f.r. § 2.64 (1987), because the department's motions were filed and allowed on the same day.we disagree.  while it would have beenpage 306better practice to have given her more advance notice and opportunity to be heard, under the circumstances of this case she was not prejudiced.  the mother was present in open court at the time the department filed the motions.  she had ample time to file appropriate motions, including a request for an in-camera hearing before the records were disclosed.she failed to make any such request and later waived any possible objection by testifying about the contents of the records at trial.we would be hard pressed to conclude that, under these circumstances, the mother was not provided with adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard.page 3073.  posttermination and postadoption visitation.  the mother also argues that the judge erred in declining to order posttermination and postadoption visitation between the mother and virgil.  ""the decision whether to grant posttermination visitation is within the judge's sound discretion.""  adoption of cecily,, 727-728 (2013).  however, such discretion is not unfettered; posttermination visitation ""must be grounded in the over-all best interests of the child, based on emotional bonding and other circumstances of the actual personal relationship of the child and the biological parent, not in the rights of the biological parent [or] the legal consequences of their natural relation.""  adoption of terrence,, 839 (2003), quoting from adoption of vito,, 562 (2000).  although a psychologist recommended that supervised visits should continue if the mother can ""maintain her emotional stability,"" the judge found that an order of visitation was not in virgil's best interests.  the judge based his decision on the mother's failure to maintain consistent visits with virgil, her inability to address her ongoing mental instability and drug addiction, and her inability to obtain stable housing.  the judge also took into consideration how the mother's instability has affected virgil's emotional well-being.  the record shows that the judge carefully considered the best interests of virgil in declining to order posttermination and postadoption visitation.  the judge did not abuse his discretion.decree affirmed.",criminal,None,affirm

[317-318]a district court judge did not err in denying the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence of an identification of the defendant from a photographic array, where, in the circumstances of the case, the absence of a ""double-blind"" procedure went to weight, not admissibility; where there was nothing unnecessarily suggestive in the process used by a police officer in including the defendant's photograph in the array; where other photographs in the array did not depict persons with significantly lighter skin than the defendant's; where the judge twice instructed the jury to evaluate the identification with particular care given the failure to follow an established protocol; where evidence that the officer conducting the identification procedure gave confirmatory feedback was not available at the hearing on the motion to suppress, and in any event, it was not clear that the officer's statement inflated the witness's confidence in his identification; and where the defendant failed to argue that the officer's deviation from procedure for preserving the photographs used in the array diminished the accuracy of the witness's identification. [318-320]page 309there was no merit to the criminal defendant's claim that the danger of unfair prejudice from a witness's identification of him from a photographic array outweighed the probative value of that identification. [320-321]at a criminal trial, even assuming that the judge erred in omitting a portion of the model jury instruction on eyewitness identification relating to high stress, the error did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, where the omitted language did not require that the jury conclude that high stress reduces accurate observations or instruct the jury on how to distinguish high levels of stress from medium or low levels; where defense counsel, in her closing argument, forcefully pointed out how stressful the incident must have been; where the judge correctly conveyed a closely related principle to the jury in another portion of the instructions; and where the fact that defense counsel did not object to the instructions as given suggested that the omission was not prejudicial. [321-323]","after a district court jury trial, the defendant was convicted of leaving the scene of an accident causing both personal injury and property damage and of operating a motor vehicle with a suspended license.on appeal, the defendant claims that (1) admission in evidence of the registry of motor vehicles' (registry) ""mailing confirmation"" document related to his notice of license suspension violated the confrontation clause and was erroneous on other grounds, (2) the commonwealth offered insufficient evidence to prove that he had notice of his license suspension, (3) his motion to suppress the victim's pretrial identification of him from a photographic array was erroneously denied, and (4) the judge improperly omitted a portion of the gomes jury instruction addressing eyewitness identification under high stress.  see commonwealth v. gomes,, 381-382 & n.9 (2015) (appendix).  we affirm.page 310background.  the jury could have found that on july 3, 2013, andres santana was operating his motorcycle in lynn, when a sport utility vehicle (suv) pulled out from a side street to make a turn.  unexpectedly, however, a green sedan pulled out immediately behind the suv and then stopped in santana's travel lane, forcing him to brake.  santana saw the driver of the sedan for about a second and observed that he was wearing a white tank top and that his left arm was tattooed.  anticipating that the sedan might proceed forward, santana tried to steer to the right and rear of the sedan to avoid a collision.  the driver, however, stared directly at santana, ""ma[king] perfect eye contact,"" and momentarily froze.santana's motorcycle struck the sedan's driver's side rear quarter panel, propelling him into the air and over the sedan.  he hit the road and rolled underneath a stopped vehicle, and by the time he stood up, he could not see the sedan.  he received medical treatment and his motorcycle was later declared a total loss.a lynn police officer arrived and spoke with santana.  the officer also found a bumper, with the license plate attached, in the intersection.  a few hours later, the officer was dispatched to a street less than a mile away where a 1997 green geo prism sedan was found parked.  the prism had damage to the rear driver's side and matched the license plate left in the intersection.  the defendant was the registered owner of the prism.two days later, on july 5, the defendant reported to the lynn police that his prism had been stolen.  he stated that the theft occurred sometime between july 3 and 5, from a street corner in lynn, and that the keys were in the vehicle and the doors locked.  further police investigation showed that, prior to the date of the collision, the defendant's operator license had been suspended and the insurance and registration for the prism had been revoked.lynn police officer john meaney attempted to locate the defendant.  on july 11, he went to the address in peabody listed for the defendant in the registry's records.  there was no answer at the door, but the prism was in the driveway.officer meaney noticed damage to the rear quarter panel but saw no damage to the windows, ignition, or steering column.several days later, the defendant telephoned officer meaneypage 311and said that he had brought the sedan to lynn and parked it there sometime on july 3.  the defendant explained that he always left a key under the mat and denied any involvement in the collision.the police prepared a photographic array that included a picture of the defendant, and on august 15, officer meaney showed santana the array.  santana identified the defendant's photograph as that of the driver.  santana also told officer meaney that the driver had tattoos, although they were not visible in the photograph.santana later identified the defendant in court as the driver.  the defense theory, advanced through cross-examination and argument, was misidentification.discussion.  1.  registry mailing confirmation.  the defendant raises three challenges to the commonwealth's use at trial of a registry mailing confirmation document to prove that he received notice of his license suspension.  he argues that use of the document violated the confrontation clause -- both because it was created for use at trial and because it was used to prove an element of the crime -- and that it was not properly authenticated.to prove the charge, the commonwealth was required to show, among other things, that the defendant had been notified that his license was suspended or revoked.  see g. l. c. 90, § 23; commonwealth v. deramo,, 50 (2002); commonwealth v. parenteau,, 5-6 (2011)  ""pursuant to g. l. c. 90, § 22(d),the commonwealth can satisfy this burden by showing that the registry properly mailed the notice of suspension or revocation, which constitutes 'prima facie evidence of receipt by the addressee.'""  id. at 6, quoting from commonwealth v. koney,page 312, 303-304 (1995).  see commonwealth v. royal,, 174 n.9 (2016).to meet this burden, the commonwealth introduced a copy of a may 10, 2013, notice addressed to the defendant, informing him that his license would be suspended effective june 9, 2013 (about one month before the july 3 collision).  the notice bore the designation:  ""usps id: 370853.""  the commonwealth also introduced a registry document entitled ""usps mailing confirmation.""  the mailing confirmation also bore the designation ""usps id: 370853,""and included the statements, ""created by rmv on:  05/10/2013"" (the same date as the notice), and ""received by usps:  05/13/2013 20:09, at post office:  02205.""  the documents were certified by the registrar of motor vehicles (registrar) under g. l. c. 90, § 22.a.  confrontation clause:  purpose for record's creation.  the defendant first argues that the mailing confirmation was inadmissible under parenteau,, because it was created for the purpose of use at trial.  in parenteau, the commonwealth had introduced a copy of the notice of license revocation together with the registrar's attested statement that the notice had been mailed on the date shown on the notice.  see id. at 4.  the attestation was dated two months after the related criminal complaint had issued.  see id. at 8.  the court held that the attestation document was testimonial because the date showed that it had been produced specifically for use at the defendant's trial.  see id. at 8-9.  the court concluded that the document's ""admission at trial in the absence of testimony from a registry witness"" violated the defendant's confrontation rights.  id. at 9.in reaching this conclusion, the parenteau court relied on melendez-diaz v. massachusetts, 557 u.s. 305 (2009), as outlining the particular characteristics that render business records, if admitted without live testimony, violative of the confrontation clause.  under melendez-diaz, ""business records are not admissible at trial 'if the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial.'""  parenteau, 460 mass. at 9, quoting from melendez-diaz, 557 u.s. at 321.  as an illustration, in melendez-diaz, the court quoted from palmer v. hoffman, which held that ""an accident report provided by an employeepage 313of a railroad company did not qualify as a business record because, although kept in the regular course of the railroad's operations, it was 'calculated for use essentially in the court, not in the business.'""  melendez-diaz, 557 u.s. at 321, quoting from palmer v. hoffman, 318 u.s. 109, 114 (1943).  ""[b]usiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because -- having been created for the administration of an entity's affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial -- they are not testimonial.""  parenteau, 460 mass. at 9, quoting from melendez-diaz, 557 u.s. at 322-324.applying these principles, the parenteau court held that the registrar's attestation of mailing, created for use at trial, was inadmissible because it was not ""a contemporaneous business record.""  id. at 10.  importantly, however, the court explained that, ""if such a record had been created at the time the notice was mailed and preserved by the registry as part of the administration of its regular business affairs, then it would have been admissible at trial.""  ibid.in response to parenteau, the registry implemented a system to create such contemporaneous records, and we upheld their admissibility against a confrontation clause challenge in royal, 89 mass. app. ct. at 174.  we concluded:""the mailing confirmation records introduced in this case appear to be such contemporaneous business records, now maintained by the registry in response to the parenteau decision.  they were properly admitted as evidence that the registry mailed, and prima facie evidence that the defendant received, the notices of intent to suspend his license.""the defendant here nevertheless presses the claim that the mailing confirmations are testimonial because they were not created for any business purpose but instead ""were created in the wake of the parenteau case for the sole purpose of allowing the commonwealth to prove notice of suspensions and revocations at trial without the use of live testimony.""  our decision in royal already rejected this argument, concluding that the mailing confirmations, created in response to the roadmap in parenteau for avoiding a confrontation clause problem, did in fact avoid that problem.  see ibid.  the court would not have laid out such a roadmap if it led only to a dead end.in assessing the purpose for the creation of the mailing confirmations, we are guided by commonwealth v. zeininger,page 314, cert. denied, 565 u.s. 967 (2011) -- a decision issued shortly before parenteau -- in which the court held admissible certain state office of alcohol testing (oat) records annually certifying the proper functioning of breathalyzer machines used to test operating under the influence (oui) suspects' blood alcohol content.  by statute, the results of a breathalyzer test are inadmissible in a prosecution for oui unless the breathalyzer has received an annual certification from oat that it meets certain accuracy criteria.  see id. at 779-780, citing g. l. c. 90, § 24k.  and, because a ""notation of [such annual] certification appears on the same report as the results of the breathalyzer test, as a matter of practice, it is admitted in evidence and published to the jury in an oui prosecution.""  id. at 780-781.the defendant in zeininger argued that the oat certification was inadmissible because ""even if a record is prepared in the regular course of business, it does not qualify as a business or official record . . . if it was 'calculated for use essentially in the court, not in business.'""  id. at 784, quoting from melendez-diaz, 557 u.s. at 321.  the supreme judicial court concluded that ""the oat certification records are not 'calculated for use essentially in the court.'""  id. at 784, quoting from palmer, 318 u.s. at 114.""rather, oat prepares the certification records in concert with its statutory charge to administer an internal regulatory program that standardizes 'satisfactory methods, techniques and criteria for the conduct of [breathalyzer] tests.'  g. l. c. 90, § 24k.  in this sense the records are 'typical of entries made systematically or as a matter of routine to . . . provide internal controls,' which are admissible under the federal rules and the common law.""ibid., quoting from palmer, 318 u.s. at 113.  the oat records were thus admissible as business records.in zeininger, the court then turned to, and rejected, the confrontation clause challenge to the oat certification records.  notwithstanding that the obvious purpose of breathalyzers is to accurately test the blood alcohol levels of oui suspects, and to provide accurate evidence against those charged with oui, the court reasoned that ""the oat certification records were made 'for the administration of an entity's affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial,'"" and thus were nontestimonial.  id. at 787, quoting from melendez-diaz, 557 u.s. at 324.  see michigan v. bryant, 562 u.s. 344, 358 (2011).page 315much of what the court said in zeininger applies equally to the registry's mailing confirmations.  the registry has a statutory duty to notify persons that their operators' licenses have been suspended or revoked.  see, e.g., g. l. c. 90, § 22(d); g. l. c. 90c, § 3(a)(6)(a).  the registry must preserve records of such notices, as well as other documents ""maintained in the normal course of business.""  g. l. c. 90, § 30, as amended by st. 2010, c. 409, § 14.  the primary purpose of registry mailing confirmations is to ""guarantee, internally, as a matter of course, and when necessary, in court,"" that the registry has performed its statutory duty of giving notice of license suspensions and revocations.  zeininger, 459 mass. at 788.in zeininger, the court stated that ""[a]t the time of [oat's] certification, the hypothetical use of that record in an as-yet-unknown criminal proceeding [was] merely an ancillary purpose, subordinate in importance to the 'administration of the entity's affairs.'"" id. at 788, quoting from melendez-diaz, 557 u.s. at 324.  here, likewise, the hypothetical use of the registry's mailing confirmation in an as-yet-unknown prosecution for operating under suspension is equally ancillary to the registry's statutory duty, regulatory in character, to suspend or revoke operators' licenses in order to protect public safety.  see luk v. commonwealth,, 423-430 (1995) (registry's license suspension or revocation serves primarily regulatory, not punitive function).further, in zeininger, 459 mass. at 788, the court distinguished oat technicians from chemists (like those in melendez-diaz), who create certificates of drug analysis, on the ground that oat technicians act with no particular prosecutorial purpose.  the court adopted the reasoning of the oregon court of appeals on this point:""although [breathalyzer machines] produce evidence that is used only in criminal prosecutions or administrative hearings, the person who performs the test of a machine's accuracy does so with no particular prosecutorial use in mind, and, indeed, there is no guarantee that the machine will ever, in fact, be used.""zeininger, 459 mass. at 788 n.18, quoting from state v. bergin, 231 or. app. 36, 41 (2009).  likewise, the registry employees who cause mailing confirmations to be created have no particularpage 316prosecutorial use in mind, and there is no guarantee that any given mailing confirmation will ever be used in court.we acknowledge that the court's ruling in zeininger rested in part on its conclusion that oat certification records were not ""offered as direct proof of an element of the offense charged,"" but instead ""bear only on the admissibility or credibility of the [breathalyzer] evidence.""  zeininger, 459 mass. at 786.  oat certification records ""bear a more attenuated relationship to conviction:  they support one fact (the accuracy of the machine) that, in turn, supports another fact that can establish guilt (blood alcohol level).""  id. at 787, quoting from bergin, 231 or. app. at 41.  here, although a registry mailing confirmation may constitute more direct proof of an element of the offense,we cannot say that zeininger therefore precludes its use.  this is because after the decision in zeininger, the court in parenteau, despite expressly recognizing that a mailing confirmation could be used as ""prima facie evidence . . . [of] an essential element of the charged crime,"" parenteau, 460 mass. at 8, indicated that a contemporaneously created mailing confirmation would be admissible.  see id. at 10.  in short, zeininger and parenteau, read together, require the conclusion that the use at trial of the registry's contemporaneously produced mailing confirmation did not violate the confrontation clause.b.  confrontation clause:  use of record to prove element of offense.  the defendant next argues that the confrontation clause bars the use of an otherwise admissible business record to prove an element of an offense -- here, that he had notice that his operator's license had been suspended.as just noted, the parenteau court implicitly rejected this argument; we explicitlypage 317rejected it in commonwealth v. weeks,(2010).  there, a defendant was charged with carrying a firearm without a license, subsequent offense; we held that certified copies of the docket sheets showing the prior convictions were nontestimonial and admissible to prove those convictions, which were plainly an element of the subsequent-offense charge at issue.  id. at 1, 5-8.  see commonwealth v. ellis,, 331-333 (2011) (same in oui subsequent-offense prosecution).  similarly, in kirby v. united states, 174 u.s. 47 (1899), the court recognized that it does not violate the confrontation clause to use a docket sheet to prove the fact of a prior conviction, where that fact is necessary to a subsequent prosecution.  id. at 54-55.c.  authentication.  equally unavailing is the defendant's argument that the mailing confirmation was not properly authenticated.  the suspension notice and mailing confirmation were attached to an attestation from the registrar, which were signed by her, stating that the ""annexed instrument(s) are true copy(s) of the . . . notice(s) of suspension/revocation as appearing in the registrar's records.""  this was sufficient.that the attestation did not specifically mention the mailing confirmation is not dispositive.  neither of the statutes making attested copies of registry records admissible -- g. l. c. 233, § 76, and g. l. c. 90, § 30 -- specifies the precise form an attestation must take.  see commonwealth v. martinez-guzman, 76 mass. app. 167, 170, 172 n.4 (2010).  see also g. l. c. 233, § 78.  the defendant does not dispute that the attestation was physically attached to the notice and mailing confirmation, and the mailing confirmation can reasonably be viewed as a component of the notice as appearing in the registrar's records, even if the mailing confirmation itself is not mailed to the operator along with the notice.  cf. commonwealth v. dias,, 563-564 (1982).  the requirement that, ""to qualify as an 'attested' copy, there must be 'a written and signed certification that [the document] is a correct copy,'"" was satisfied.  deramo, 436 mass. at 47, quoting from henderson v. united states, 778 f. supp. 274, 277 (d.s.c. 1991).2.  sufficiency of evidence that notice was sent.  contrary to the defendant's argument, the mailing confirmation contained sufficient details, as outlined supra, from which a jury could reasonably infer that the registry mailed the suspension notice to the defendant.  see royal, 89 mass. app. ct. at 174.  this constituted prima facie evidence that the defendant received the notice.  seepage 318parenteau, 460 mass. at 6.  this case is thus nothing like commonwealth v. oyewole,(2014), relied upon by the defendant, where there was no evidence that the defendant had been notified, in writing or orally, of his license suspension.  see id. at 1016-1017.3.  motion to suppress photographic array identification.  the defendant argues that the motion judge erred in denying, after an evidentiary hearing, the motion to suppress santana's identification of the defendant in the photographic array.  the defendant maintains that the identification was so unnecessarily suggestive as to violate constitutional principles and was unreliable under common-law fairness principles.  we disagree.a.  constitutional principles.  in moving to suppress, the defendant had the burden to prove ""by a preponderance of the evidence that the identification was 'so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable misidentification that its admission would deprive the defendant of his right to due process.'""  commonwealth v. johnson,, 597 (2016), quoting from commonwealth v. walker,, 599 (2011).  ""in considering whether identification testimony should be suppressed, the judge must examine 'the totality of the circumstances attending the confrontation to determine whether it was unnecessarily suggestive.'""  ibid., quoting from commonwealth v. silva-santiago,, 795 (2009).the defendant asserts six separate flaws in the photographic array identification process.  as the relevant facts are undisputed, we review, without deference to the motion judge, the application of the law to those facts.  see id. at 602.first, officer meaney, because he knew which photograph was that of the suspect (i.e., the defendant) and also presented the array to santana, did not follow the ""double-blind procedure"" recognized as the ""better practice"" in silva-santiago, 453 mass. at 797.  but here, as in silva-santiago, ""there was no evidence that the [officer] who presented the photographic arrays signaled a particular response to, or otherwise attempted to influence,"" the witness.  ibid.  in these circumstances, the absence of a double-blind procedure went to weight, not admissibility.  see ibid.page 319second, the defendant asserts that officer meaney failed to follow the lynn police department's eyewitness identification procedures, in that he did not obtain a description of the suspect before presenting the photographic array to santana.  but the procedures do not require such a step.  they assume, but do not require, that a witness description will be used in order to select ""fillers"" for the array; they do not make a suspect's resemblance to a previously-obtained description the only permissible basis for including that suspect's photograph in an array.  here, the bumper and license plate left at the scene pointed to the defendant (the prism's owner) as a logical suspect,and once his photograph was obtained from the registry, photographs of similar-looking persons, from the same source, were used to fill out the array.  we see nothing unnecessarily suggestive in this process.third, the defendant's claim that the other photographs in the array depicted persons with significantly lighter skin than his is not borne out by the color copy of the array in the record.  see id. at 795 (array not unnecessarily suggestive where it included photographs of individuals with ""reasonably similar features and characteristics"").fourth, that the photographs were shown simultaneously rather than sequentiallygoes to weight rather than admissibility, because there is no near consensus in the scientific community regarding which method is more reliable.  see commonwealth v. thomas,, 463-464 (2017).  the defendant points out that lynn police department procedures call for the array to be shown sequentially, ""one at a time.""  as the thomas court said, however,""[the] model jury instructions on eyewitness identification direct juries to 'evaluate the identification with particular care' where the police fail to follow a protocol that is established or recommended by the law enforcement agency conducting the identification procedure. . . .   a defendant maypage 320request such an instruction where a police department that has chosen the sequential method fails to employ it in an identification procedure.thomas, 476 mass. at 464 n.10, quoting the model jury instructions on eyewitness identification, 473 mass. 1051, 1056-1057 (2015) (model instructions).  here, the judge gave that ""particular care"" instruction twice in her final charge.fifth, the defendant argues that officer meaney, by telling santana that the photograph he had chosen was that of ""the registered owner of the car,"" gave ""confirmatory feedback [that] artificially inflate[d] [the] eyewitness's level of confidence in his . . . identification.""  commonwealth v. collins,, 263 (2014).  but officer meaney's testimony that he made this statement was elicited not at the suppression hearing, but only later, at trial.  ""evidence adduced at trial but not before the motion judge . . . cannot be determinative of the propriety of the motion judge's decision.""  commonwealth v. ramos,, 216 (1988).  in any event, it is far from clear that the statement inflated santana's confidence in his identification.  officer meaney testified at the hearing that after santana chose the defendant's photograph and said ""that's the person who was driving the car,"" the officer asked santana ""how sure he was, and he replied that he was positive.""  and santana testified at the hearing that he was ""sure"" of his identification from the photograph.sixth and finally, the defendant notes that, contrary to lynn police procedures, officer meaney did not preserve the photographs from the array or make high quality copies of them; instead, he took a color photograph of the entire array, and that photograph was admitted in evidence at the suppression hearing and at trial.  the defendant has not argued, however, that this departure from procedure diminished the accuracy of santana's identification or furnished any other ground for suppression.  moreover, as noted, the jury were instructed to evaluate ""with particular care"" an identification not made in accordance with established procedures.b.  common-law fairness principles.  the defendant also argues that the identification should have been excluded under common-page 321law fairness principles, because various factors made it so minimally probative that its value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice arising from the assertedly suggestive circumstances in which it was made.  see johnson, 473 mass. at 598-602; commonwealth v. dew,, 315-316 (2017).  the defendant notes that santana had never seen the prism's driver before the collision, santana saw him only very briefly,and some time elapsed between the collision and santana's photographic array identification.see id. at 316 (listing witness's prior familiarity with person identified, opportunity to observe offender at time of crime, and amount of time between crime and identification as factors to be considered).  the defendant bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, and we review the judge's ruling for abuse of discretion.  see johnson, 473 mass. at 599, 602.here, santana was able to directly observe the driver during daylight, for long enough to observe what he was wearing, that his left arm was tattooed, and the expression on his face.  santana was sufficiently collected to attempt to steer around the prism.  although santana had never seen the driver before, and did not identify him from the photographic array until some weeks after the collision, against these factors detracting from the identification's probative value must be balanced the minimal evidence, discussed supra, that the identification was suggestive.  the motion judge was not required to conclude that the identification's probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  he did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to suppress on this basis.4.  jury instruction.  the defendant argues that it was error to omit that portion of the provisional identification instructionpage 322appended to gomes, 470 mass. at 381-382 (appendix), relating to high stress, and providing as follows:""you should also consider characteristics of the witness when the observation was made, such as the quality of the witness's eyesight, whether the witness knew the offender, and, if so, how well, and-- high levels of stress, compared to low to medium levels, can reduce an eyewitness's ability to accurately perceive an event"" (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).because the defendant did not object to this omission, we review to determine whether any error created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.see commonwealth v. keevan,, 564 (1987).  as the record does not disclose the reason for the judge's omission, we assume without deciding that it was error, but we conclude that it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.the omitted language informs the jury that a high degree of stress can reduce accurate observations, but it does not require the jury to conclude that high stress does so, and the jury could have concluded otherwise here.nor does the language instruct the jury on how to distinguish between ""high"" levels of stress and ""medium"" levels, which may actually enhance perception, see gomes, 470 mass. at 382 n.9 (appendix), or ""low"" levels of stress.  defense counsel forcefully pointed out how stressful the incident must have been in her closing, arguing that santana had:""one second to observe. . . .  mr. santana's life flashed before his eyes . . . .  he was downshifting to a different gear.  hepage 323knows a crash is imminent.  he's approaching quickly to the car.  he's trying to swerve his bike out of the way.  he hits the rear quarter panel and is ejected from his motorcycle. . . .  he [re]lied on a one-second observation?  . . .  i would suggest to you that you could not.""in addition, another portion of the judge's instruction correctly conveyed a closely related principle to the jury:""you the jury must decide whether the witness' identification is accurate.  consider the witness' opportunity to observe the offender at the time of the offense; how good a look the witness had of the offender, the degree of attention the witness was paying to the offender at the time, the distance between the witness and the offender . . . and the length of time the witness had to observe the offender.""that the defendant, despite having requested the gomes instruction, did not object when invited to do so at the conclusion of the charge, see note 14, supra, further suggests that the omission was not prejudicial.  see commonwealth v. lucien,, 664-665 (2004) (absence of objection weighs against defendant's claim of prejudice).  for all of these reasons, ""we conclude that there is no substantial risk that [any error in] the judge's instruction . . . may have materially influenced the verdict in this case, and therefore no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.""  commonwealth v. shea,, 797 (2014).judgments affirmed.",criminal,Ellen Flatley,affirm

[326-331]","the spencer-east brookfield teachers' association (association) appeals from a judgment of the superior court permanently staying the grievance arbitration proceeding commenced by the association before the department of labor relations (dlr).  the association argues that the arbitration became moot once the teacher involved withdrew his grievance, and, thus, the matter should have been dismissed.  at the same time, the association argues that the teacher had an absolute right to arbitrate an alleged collective bargaining agreement (cba) violationpage 325that preceded his termination.  the association maintains that it is irrelevant that the teacher did not have professional teacher status, that he had been employed for less than ninety days, and that reinstatement was the remedy being sought.  we affirm.background.  the spencer-east brookfield regional school district (district) and the association entered into a cba that covered the period july 1, 2015, through june 30, 2018.  edward suglia was hired by the district in december, 2015.  his employment was terminated on january 15, 2016, after approximately forty-four days of employment with the district.  on january 19, 2016, the association filed a grievance on behalf of suglia which asserted that his ""rights under the collective bargaining agreement were violated by the school committee . . . when he was terminated . . . without the supports and process that are contractually guaranteed.""  the school committee, pursuant to level four of article xx of the cba, determined that it had no jurisdiction over the grievance because it was a personnel matter, and notified the association that it could proceed to level five of the grievance procedure.in april, 2016, the association filed a petition to arbitrate suglia's termination with the dlr.  the petition asserted that the termination violated the terms of the cba because the district had failed in its obligations pursuant to article xvi and article viii of the cba.the association specifically asserted that suglia's termination violated the provisions of the ""educator evaluation process"" instrument, which provides a procedure for evaluating teacher progress and is incorporated by reference into the parties' cba.as remedies, the petition sought ""[r]einstatement; make grievant whole; and any and all additional appropriate remedy.""page 326pursuant to g. l. c. 150c, § 2(b), the district sought a permanent stay of the grievance arbitration proceedings that had been commenced in the dlr, on the ground that the association's demand was not arbitrable.  the superior court issued an order, dated september 7, 2016, allowing the district's application to stay the grievance arbitration, and finding that, in the circumstances of this case, the association had no right to grievance arbitration under the cba and that its remedy existed exclusively in statute.  shortly thereafter, because the matter was pending in the superior court, the association sought and obtained a temporary administrative closure of the grievance arbitration proceedings.the district then notified the dlr of the court's order staying the arbitration proceedings and requested the dismissal of the arbitration proceeding.  the association filed an opposition to the requested dismissal.  on october 28, 2016, however, the association withdrew its petition for grievance arbitration before the dlr and notified the superior court that the ""plaintiff's petition to stay arbitration is now moot and there is no need for further proceedings beyond the decision already issued by this court.""  the district responded by seeking entry of judgment permanently staying the grievance arbitration sought by the association.  a judge of the superior court allowed the motion, determining that the issue in dispute had been decided on the merits and had been fully adjudicated.  he further found that the issue raised as to whether the cba ""may provide for arbitration of teachers' rights that transcend the ones particular to [the] terminated member . . . merits resolution despite the . . . withdrawal of [the] arbitration petition,"" and that the matter was not moot.  the association appeals from that determination.discussion.  the association argues that the superior court should have dismissed, as being moot, the district's motion for entry of judgment because the association had withdrawn the petition for grievance arbitration, with prejudice.  as we have noted, the judge considered and rejected this argument when allowing the district's motion.  see wolf v. commissioner of pub. welfare,, 298-299 (1975) (in case ""of asserted importance, capable of repetition, yet evading review . . . a court should take particular care that judicial review not be foreclosed on the basis of technical mootness"" [citations and quotations omitted]).  here, the association had argued that ""the issue presented may deal with important rights of all teachers covered bypage 327its collective bargaining agreement, an agreement that the [association] argued at hearing may be 'nullified' by the court action here.""  we, however, agree with the judge that the matter is not moot, and will therefore consider the court's legal holding.the association argues that it has the right to arbitrate a purported violation of the cba that preceded the district's termination of suglia's employment.teacher dismissals are governed by the statutory scheme contained in g. l. c. 71, § 42.see groton-dunstable regional sch. comm. v. groton-dunstable educators assn.,(2015).  section 42 provides three different levels of procedural and substantive due process requirements and protections for public school teachers being terminated from their employment.teachers with ""professional teacher status,"" which they are entitled to after three school years of consecutive service, are afforded the greatest degree of due process rights and protections.g. l. c. 71, § 41, as appearing in st. 1993, c. 71, § 43.  seepage 328downing v. lowell,, 783-784 (2001); groton-dunstable regional sch. comm. v. groton-dunstable educators assn., supra.  the statute provides that teachers with professional teacher status may not be terminated from employment except for ""inefficiency, incompetency, incapacity, conduct unbecoming a teacher, insubordination or failure on the part of the teacher to satisfy teacher performance standards developed pursuant to section thirty-eight"" of chapter 71.  g. l. c. 71, § 42, as appearing in st. 1993, c. 71, § 44.  such a teacher also has the statutory right to receive written notice of the intent to terminate employment with an explanation and documentation of the reasons sufficient to allow the teacher to respond.  finally, such a teacher also has the statutory right to seek review of his or her termination at an arbitral hearing at which he or she may present evidence and call witnesses.  the school district carries the burden of proof at any such hearing.  ibid.a lesser degree of due process protection is afforded to public school teachers who have not attained professional teacher status but who have been teaching in a school system for at least ninety calendar days but less than three consecutive school years.  such a teacher shall not be dismissed unless he or she has been ""furnished with written notice of intent to dismiss and with an explanation of the grounds for the dismissal in sufficient detail to permit the teacher to respond and documents relating to the grounds for dismissal.""  ibid.  such a teacher shall also have the right, if requested, to review the decision to terminate employment with the principal or superintendent and to ""present information pertaining to the basis of the decision and to the teacher's status.""  ibid.  the teacher may be represented by an attorney or other representative at such a meeting.  the statute does not provide the right, however, for such a teacher to review the decision to terminate employment by filing a petition to arbitrate.  ibid.lastly, a public school teacher who has not attained professional teacher status and who has held his or her teaching position for less than ninety calendar days has no statutory protections provided by g. l. c. 71, § 42.

[354]","on november 28, 2010, kimmy dubuque (kimmy)was hit by a speeding sport utility vehicle (suv) while walking into a cumberland farms, inc. (cumberland farms), convenience store in chicopee (chicopee store).  she died instantly.  the suv had traveled at high speed across an intersection, through the ""apex"" entrance into the chicopee store's parking lot, and crashed through the facade of the store.kimmy's husband, albert, as executor of her estate (albert or the plaintiff), brought this action pursuant to g. l. c. 229, § 2, alleging that her death had been caused by the negligence and gross negligence of cumberland farms.  specifically, albert claimed that cumberland farms, which had experienced hundreds of ""car strikes"" at its convenience stores, was on notice of the risks motor vehicles posed to customers at its stores, including the chicopee store.  albert claimed that cumberland farms couldpage 334have prevented kimmy's death by installing bollards or other protective barriers along the walkway and by closing off and erecting barriers at the apex entrance to the parking lot.  in its defense, cumberland farms argued that it could not be held liable because there had been no prior car strikes at the chicopee store itself, the accident was completely random and unforeseeable, and there were no reasonable measures that would have prevented the incursion of such a large vehicle traveling at high speed.after a nine-day trial, a jury found cumberland farms negligent and awarded $32,369,024.30 in compensatory damages to the plaintiff, as executor of kimmy's estate.  the jury also found that cumberland farms had acted with gross negligence, or had engaged in wilful, wanton, or reckless conduct, and awarded the plaintiff an additional ten dollars in punitive damages.the plaintiff waived the punitive damage award because it fell below the $5,000 statutory minimum.  see g. l. c. 229, § 2.  cumberland farms then filed motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, new trial, and remittitur.  the trial judge denied the first motion.  he then concluded that the $32,369,024.30 compensatory damages award was disproportionately high compared to the evidence, and the product of ""some degree"" of passion, partiality, or prejudice.  he therefore ordered a new trial on the issue of damages unless the plaintiff accepted a reduced compensatory damages award of $20 million.  the plaintiff accepted the reduced award, and an amended judgment dated january 9, 2017, entered.  the parties then filed the present cross appeals.cumberland farms now seeks a new trial on grounds that the judge improperly admitted an internal report regarding 485 prior car strikes at its other stores without first subjecting each of the prior accidents to a ""rigorous"" review to ensure that they were substantially similar to the dubuque accident.  in the alternative, cumberland farms submits that given what it contends was the entirely random and unforeseeable series of events at issue, it did not owe kimmy a duty of care as a matter of law.  cumberland farms further maintains that a new trial is required in light of the judge's finding that the jury acted, to some degree, out of passion, partiality, or prejudice.  the plaintiff, in turn, seeks reinstatement of the $32,369,024.30 compensatory damages award, claiming that the trial judge committed an abuse of discretion when he allowed the motion for remittitur.  for the reasons set forth below, we affirm the amended judgment.page 335background.  for the purpose of reviewing the evidence on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we review the evidence presented at trial ""in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,"" o'brien v. pearson,, 383 (2007), reserving other facts and issues for later discussion.  the jury could have found the following facts.1.  the accident.  on the morning of november 28, 2010, kimmy and albert dubuque went christmas shopping and stopped at the chicopee store, which was located on a corner at the four-way intersection of grove street, grove avenue, and front street (intersection), so that kimmy could buy a cup of coffee.  albert dropped kimmy off near the front of the store and drove away to park and await her return.  kimmy stepped onto the walkway and opened the front door of the store, whereupon she encountered amy gladu, a store employee.  gladu was in the process of taking out a bag of trash.  kimmy held the door open for gladu while she did this, and the two then started to enter the store.at roughly the same time, eighty-one year old edwin skowyra was driving his 2004 ford explorer suv down front street toward the chicopee store.  a short distance before the intersection, he brought the vehicle to a complete stop, likely at a crosswalk.the suv then began to move forward.  as it did so, skowyra lost control, and the suv accelerated rapidly.the suv raced straight down front street, across the intersection, and up a short ramp at the apex entrance to the chicopee store parking lot.  by that time, the suv was traveling at approximately seventy miles per hour and bouncing; its wheels came off the ground.  the suv passed just to the right of a tall cumberland farms sign and a set of fueling pumps, up onto the walkway, and crashed through the front door and facade of the store at the same time that kimmy was going inside behind gladu.  the suv, which was traveling approximately fifty-seven miles per hour upon impact with the facade of the store, did not stop until it was completelypage 336inside the store.  the vehicle struck kimmy and pushed her deep into the store, killing her.  gladu was also injured in the crash but survived.2.  the dubuques.  on november 28, 2010, kimmy was forty-three years old.  she had a loving and close relationship with her husband of sixteen years, albert, and their one child, jillian, who was then fourteen years old.  the three lived together in chicopee.  they enjoyed a special bond that dated to their shared experience as jillian underwent treatment for leukemia at the age of two.  kimmy ""was always there"" through jillian's hospitalization and medical treatments, and albert relied on kimmy heavily during this time.  even after jillian's leukemia went into remission, she grew older, and started high school, the three continued to be close.  they did many things together, including taking nightly walks, golfing, and going to the trailer they maintained at a campground most weekends.  as she had throughout most of her adult life, kimmy also continued to work full time as the director of finance at the springfield civic center.  as of november 28, 2010, her annual salary was approximately $79,000.  based on her work life expectancy, her then-present economic value to her family was $1.6 million.3.  cumberland farms.  cumberland farms is a third generation, family-owned company that started as a dairy farm in cumberland, rhode island, and grew into a multi-state chain of convenience stores.  along the way, cumberland farms also expanded into the sale of gasoline.  by november 28, 2010, it employed approximately 6,500 people and owned and operated nearly 600 convenience stores, many of which included gasoline stations.  cumberland farms had more than 40 million customer visits per year and generated roughly $17 billion in annual sales revenue.a.  chicopee store.  since 1974, one of those convenience stores and gasoline stations was located at the intersection in chicopee.  like many of cumberland farms's stores, the chicopee store satpage 337on a small, crowded lot of land.the store itself, which had a facade consisting of large glass windows, a short brick ""knee wall,"" and a single glass door, sat in the rear corner of the lot.  as at most of cumberland farms's stores, there were ""nose-in"" parking spaces along the front and side of the store, designed to provide quick, in-and-out access.  the parking spaces were separated from the store by a four-foot wide concrete walkway, elevated a few inches above the surface of the parking lot.  there were no devices or barriers along the walkway to protect pedestrians from motor vehicles.  finally, a set of fueling pumps and a tall sign were situated in front of the store, close to the intersection.grove street was the primary road that bisected the intersection in front of the chicopee store.  grove avenue and front street, meanwhile, approached from opposite sides and terminated at the intersection.  all three roads had a single travel lane in each direction, divided by solid double yellow lines, and speed limits of twenty-five miles per hour.  the intersection, which was controlled by traffic lights, was ""skewed"" or ""cockeyed,"" meaning that the roads did not converge at perfect ninety-degree angles.  this was significant for two reasons.  first, the corner lot occupied by the chicopee store came to a point, or ""apex,"" at the intersection as a result of the less-than-ninety-degree angle at which the two abutting roads, grove street and grove avenue, came together.  second, any vehicle traveling on front street towards the intersection would, because of the angle at which that road approached, be headed directly at the chicopee store.b.  apex entrance.  there were three vehicle entrances at the chicopee store property.  there was one entrance each along grove street and grove avenue, both distanced from the intersection.  consistent with recommended traffic engineering practices, both of those entrances forced motorists to slow to make a ""rational transition[]"" as they executed a ninety-degree turn to enter the parking lot.the same was not true of the third entrance, located at the apex, directly on the intersection, across from front street.  motorists could drive in through the apex entrance without turning or reducing speed.  over the years, people operating vehicles of all types had been observed doing just that, oftenpage 338entering the parking lot at high rates of speed.  one employee had complained to two separate chicopee store managers that the situation was dangerous, but no action was taken.as cumberland farms was aware, the use of apex entranceshad, for years, been discouraged by the massachusetts department of transportation (dot) and altogether banned by many municipalities based on the determination that they are dangerous.  in the late 1970s, the city of chicopee (city) enacted its own ordinance prohibiting the use of such entrances.  since the apex entrance at the chicopee store already existed, however, it was ""grandfathered"" and was not subject to the ordinance.  nonetheless, in 2009, both the dot and city approached cumberland farms and asked it to close that entrance.  cumberland farms, aware that the dot was planning to close the entrance itself as part of a future road project, declined to do so.  nor did it install guardrails or other barriers as an interim measure.  as of november 28, 2010, the dot project was in progress but had yet to reach the intersection, and the apex entrance remained open.c.  car strikes; bollards.  between 1990 and 2010, there had been hundreds of vehicles striking buildings at cumberland farms convenience stores in various locations.  in each, a driver, for one reason or another, lost control of a motor vehicle, causing it to strike the building.  in some instances these incidents involved customers and employees.  cumberland farms kept track of these incidents, which were referred to internally as ""car strikes.""most of the car strikes involved vehicles traveling at low rates of speed.  none had occurred at the chicopee store.over time, employees of cumberland farms had become increasingly aware of these car strikes, and took steps to document them.  in 1988, matthew peterson, who was responsible for tracking car strikes and pursuing claims to recover the cost of the resulting property damage, became concerned by the frequency with which they were occurring -- at the rate of approximately one per week.  peterson wrote a memorandum to his superior at cumberland farms warning that the car strikes were becomingpage 339costly and were eventually going to result in bodily injury.there was no response to his memorandum.  the car strikes continued.in the 1990s, a vehicle pulled into a cumberland farms store parking lot, failed to stop, and fatally crushed a man who was using a pay phone mounted to the side of the building.  in 2001, another customer was struck by an uncontrolled motor vehicle as he walked out of the front door of a store in south deerfield.  the driver was driving a pickup truck into a nose-in parking space along the walkway in front of that store when she accidentally stepped on the accelerator, propelling the truck forward.  the truck struck the man, pushing him through the brick knee-wall and plate glass window facade.one of the victim's legs was amputated as a result of the accident.  in both cases, claims were lodged against cumberland farms asserting that it could have prevented the harm by installing protective barriers in front of the pay phone and along the walkway, respectively.  in 2004, cumberland farms settled the south deerfield claim for an undisclosed sum.prompted by that settlement, thomas masiello, director of risk management for cumberland farms, advocated for the implementation of a widespread bollard program to protect customers, employees, and property from uncontrolled motor vehicles.  bollards are posts, consisting of steel tubes, which can be designed and manufactured in varying sizes and strengths, filled with concrete and sometimes reinforcing steel plates, one end of which is sunk several feet deep in the ground into a base of concrete or a combination of concrete and steel reinforcing rebar.  in furtherance of his effort, masiello asked peterson to provide him with data regarding the history of car strikes at cumberland farms stores.  peterson reported that there had been at least 268 car strikes between 1990 and 2004 (2004 internal report).  there were no statutes, regulations, or ordinances, however, that required the installation of bollards at stores.while masiellopage 340continued to advocate on an annual basis for a bollard program, his proposal failed to gain support within cumberland farms.the car strikes continued in various locations.  for example, in 2009, a car careened through an intersection in norridgewock, maine, and ran into the fueling pumps at the cumberland farms store there, setting them ablaze and causing bodily injury.the same year, a woman drove a car into the center of a cumberland farms store in hopkinton, causing over $90,000 in property damage.  then, in 2010, a car drove through the front of a cumberland farms store in cromwell, connecticut, injuring two employees.  the spouse of one of the employees sent an electronic mail message (e-mail) to masiello, requesting that barriers be installed at the store to prevent a reoccurrence.masiello, in turn, forwarded the e-mail to cumberland farms's chief executive officer, ari haseotes, who was still considering the longstanding recommendation for a bollard program.earlier in 2010, masiello asked peterson to update the historical car strike data.  according to the resulting report, which consisted of a one-page summary and a lengthy supporting spreadsheet, there had been 485 car strikes between january 1, 2000, and january 28, 2010 (2010 internal report).  a number of the car strikes were described in the report in brief terms (e.g., ""damage to building"").  however, a large majority were described, in one fashion or another, as having involved vehicles striking the front of a cumberland farms store, in many cases at or near the door.according to the 2010 internal report, the 485 car strikespage 341resulted in at least $1.63 million in property damage and the payment of approximately $2.2 million in personal injury claims.  the report was forwarded to and reviewed by haseotes as he continued to weigh the request for a bollard program.in the summer of 2010, haseotes approved a preliminary budget of $2 million for the installation of bollards at 200 cumberland farms stores during the next fiscal year.  the bollards, which were to be placed along the walkways in front of stores, were designed to protect people and property from low impact, low speed car strikes.  to qualify for the program, a store had to have had two or more car strikes, or be among the highest revenue generators.  the chicopee store satisfied neither criterion.  as of november 28, 2010, therefore, there was no plan to install bollards along the walkway in front of the chicopee store.as of november 28, 2010, cumberland farms had yet to install bollards on any significant basis at its stores.  to the extent that bollards had been installed at any stores,they were installed primarily to protect cumberland farms property, such as structural columns, trash dumpsters, and air and vacuum machines.  only occasionally were bollards installed along walkways in front of stores.to that end, the only bollards at the chicopee store as of november 28, 2010, had been installed to protect the store's sign.4.  expert witnesses.  at trial, the plaintiff presented the testimony of three expert witnesses, a retired massachusetts state trooper who specialized in accident reconstruction, a traffic engineer, and a mechanical engineer.  in response, cumberland farms presented the testimony of its own mechanical engineer.  viewing all of their testimony in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the jury would have been warranted in finding that, for a reasonable amount of money, protective barriers could have been designed and installed that would have prevented skowyra's suv frompage 342reaching kimmy as she entered the chicopee store.specifically, the plaintiff's mechanical engineer, who had extensive experience designing bollards and other types of barriers to protect against large vehicles traveling at high speed,opined that a system of bollards, a short radius guardrail, or a group of planters could have been designed and installed at the apex entrance that would have prevented a vehicle the size of skowyra's, traveling at seventy miles per hour, from encroaching upon the chicopee store property.he further opined that a system of bollards could have been designed and installed along the walkway that would have stopped such a vehicle traveling at fifty-seven miles per hour, the speed at which the suv was travelling when it hit the store.  the total cost to design and install both sets of barriers would not have exceeded $20,000.discussion.  1.  the 2010 internal report.  cumberland farms first argues that a new trial is required because it was unduly prejudiced by the admission of the 2010 internal report and the 485 prior car strikes identified in that report.admission of evidence of prior accidents may be ""viewed with disfavor because the other incidents 'may have been the consequence of idiosyncratic circumstances.'""  santos v. chrysler corp.,, 202 (1999) (santos), quoting from read v. mt. tompage 343ski area, inc.,, 902 (1994) (read).  however, ""where substantial identity in the circumstances appears, and the danger of unfairness, confusion or undue expenditure of time in the trial of collateral issues reasonably seems small to the trial judge, he has generally been left free to admit such evidence in his discretion.""  robitaille v. netoco community theatre of n. attleboro, inc.,, 268 (1940) (robitaille).  see denton v. park hotel, inc.,, 527 (1962) (trial judge's discretion to admit such evidence is ""very considerable"").  on appeal, a trial judge's ruling is accorded ""great deference"" and can be deemed an abuse of discretion only if we conclude that he ""made a clear error of judgment in weighing the factors relevant to the decision . . . such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives.""  l.l. v. commonwealth,, 185 n.27 (2014) (l.l.) (quotation omitted).  we do not reach such a conclusion here.before trial, cumberland farms filed a motion in limine to exclude all evidence of prior car strikes, including those identified in the 2010 internal report.  cumberland farms maintained that the incidents were not substantially identical to the dubuque accident, and that admitting such evidence would result in unfair prejudice, confusion, or undue expenditure of time.  after holding a hearing and taking the matter under advisement, the judge denied the motion and ruled:""i am satisfied that plaintiff has met [his] burden as set forth in robitaille.  the scope of the relevant risk at issue as plaintiff posits, is uncontrolled vehicles hitting at or near a cumberland farms store entrance and endangering pedestrians.  as in santos, the 'differences between the other incidents and the plaintiff's accident could be considered by the jury in terms of weight of the evidence.'  [430 mass.] at 203.  counsel may request a curative instruction limiting the scope of admissibility of such evidence at the time such evidence is proffered.""subsequently, when the plaintiff moved for the admission of the 2010 internal report, the judge confirmed that he had determined that the jury could find that the prior car strikes were ""substantially similar"" to the dubuque accident.  he also invited cumberland farms, for a second time, to request a limiting instructionpage 344and shared his own thoughts on what one might look like.  cumberland farms did not submit a proposed instruction, but did approve of the one outlined by the judge and requested that he provide it to the jury.  the judge, therefore, instructed the jury at that time as follows:""you may consider, if you wish, evidence pertaining to prior car strikes at cumberland farms stores as notice to cumberland farms of those car strikes and not as evidence of negligence and/or gross negligence on the part of cumberland farms in those prior car strikes.  you may only consider such evidence as proof of negligence or gross negligence in this case if you first find that the earlier car strikes were substantially similar to the incident at issue.""and as with all the evidence which [the plaintiff] presents, [the plaintiff] must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the other car strikes are substantially similar by a preponderance of the evidence.""later, when evidence of another car strike was admitted, the judge, at cumberland farms's request, provided the jury with the instruction for a second time.  cumberland farms also requested that the instruction, with some additional language, be included in the final charge.  the same instruction, therefore, was provided to the jury for a third time, albeit minus the requested additional language.a.  limiting instruction.  cumberland farms contends that the limiting instruction was erroneous and improperly served to transfer the judge's gatekeeping obligations to the jury.  the judge did not abdicate his gatekeeping function.  his role was to determine whether the jury could find substantial similarity between the car strikes identified in the 2010 internal report and the dubuque accident.  see santos, 430 mass. at 202.  he made that threshold determination.  it was for the jurors to make the ultimate finding.  the instruction did not suggest anything to the contrary.b.  substantial similarity.  cumberland farms further contends that, to the extent that the judge did undertake his gatekeeping obligations, he failed to apply a sufficiently strict test to assess substantial similarity.  specifically, the defendant contends that all prior car strikes from the 2010 internal report should have been excluded unless they were shown to have involved (1) a vehicle crashing into a cumberland farms store (2) in a residential andpage 345small business area, (3) in a low speed zone, (4) while traveling at or above legal highway speed, (5) and following a medical or other incapacitation of a driver (6) that caused loss of control (7) at a remote location on a public way.  the proposed test, however, would result in the exclusion of all car strikes that were not completely identical to the dubuque accident.such an exceedingly rigorous test was not required.  while some cases refer to a test of ""substantial identity,"" see, e.g., robitaille, 305 mass. at 267-268; read, 37 mass. app. ct. at 902, others refer to it as a test of ""substantial similarity.""  see, e.g., santos, 430 mass. at 202; commonwealth v. guinan,, 456 (2014).  there is no meaningful difference between the two.  santos, supra at 202 n.8.  the test, which is fact and case specific, is one of relevance.  see kromhout v. commonwealth,, 693 (1986); read, supra.  and, while the circumstances of the other accidents must be substantially similar, they need ""not replicate the exact circumstances of the plaintiff's accident.""  santos, supra at 203.  see flood v. southland,, 293 (1992), s.c.,, 72-73 n.12 (1993) (flood).  the relevant risk in this case, as the judge properly framed it, ""was uncontrolled vehicles hitting at or near a cumberland farms store entrance and endangering pedestrians due to a lack of adequate protective barriers.""  absolute identity of circumstance was not required, and the reasons for the uncontrolled car strikes need not be the same.  it is enough that the evidence showed that cumberland farms was aware of the risk of the uncontrolled car strikes at its stores; the evidence was relevant to both foreseeability and breach of duty.  ""the differences . . . could be considered by the jury in terms of the weight of the evidence.""  santos, supra.in particular, cumberland farms contends that the trial judge committed prejudicial error by declining to examine the ""individual driver behavior"" in each of the 485 car strikes to ensure substantial similarity with skowyra's behavior.  for purposes of assessing foreseeability, the assessment of risk is not dependent upon the reason why the driver lost control of his or her vehicle.  the 2010 internal report showed that drivers had lost control of their vehicles and struck the fronts of stores for a host of reasons, including brake failure, brake and accelerator pedal confusion, intoxication, inexperience, and inattention.  regardless, what was relevant was whether cumberland farms was aware of the risk of uncontrolled vehicles striking the fronts of its stores and endangeringpage 346customers and employees.  the judge did not abuse his discretion when he decided that uncontrolled car strikes, rather than the precise reason for the car strikes, were relevant to the jury's consideration of whether the risk was foreseeable and whether cumberland farms was aware of that risk.c.  detail.  cumberland farms further contends that it was not possible to determine whether all 485 car strikes were substantially similar to the dubuque accident because there was insufficient detail in the 2010 internal report.  there was, as noted above, sufficient detail to determine that a large majority of the 485 car strikes involved uncontrolled vehicles striking the front of a store, at or near the door.  accordingly, the judge did not abuse his discretion in concluding that the report was sufficiently detailed to go to the jury.d.  prejudice.  cumberland farms submits, in the alternative, that, even if the 2010 internal report was relevant, it was unduly prejudicial due to the sheer number of car strikes identified.  according to the defendant, 485 incidents exceeds, by an ""astounding"" amount, the number of prior accidents admitted in any other negligence case.even if we assume that the number is larger than that admitted in other cases, the concern is not sufficient to warrant the relief sought.  the facts spoke for themselves -- cumberland farms had experienced an average of one car strike per week for a sustained period of time at various stores.  cumberland farms was on notice of these occurrences and took steps to protect its property, such as the sign at the chicopee store.  the evidence was not presented in a way that overshadowed the trial.  the 485 car strikes were presented through a single document, without an undue expenditure of time.  likewise, there was no suggestion that all 485 car strikes involvedpage 347precisely the same circumstances as the dubuque accident, and cumberland farms was free to point out any differences to the jury.  the jurors were equipped to determine what weight, if any, to give the evidence in light of any such differences.  in that regard, the judge instructed that the jury were only to consider a prior car strike if they first determined that it was substantially similar.we presume the jury understood and followed that instruction.  see commonwealth v. donahue,, 718 (2000).2.  foreseeability.  cumberland farms next contends that the dubuque accident was random and unforeseeable as a matter of law, because skowyra unintentionally encroached upon the chicopee store property from the adjacent public ways, at ""highway-like"" speed.cumberland farms was ""not a guarantor of the safety of persons lawfully on its premises.""  luisi v. foodmaster supermkts., inc.,, 577 (2000).  cumberland farms was obligated to guard against reasonably foreseeable risks of harm, i.e., those risks that it knew or reasonably should have known about and against which it could have employed reasonable preventive measures.  see flood, 416 mass. at 72-73; whittaker v. saraceno,, 200 (1994) (whitaker).although cumberland farms describes the dubuque accident as anomalous, the evidence at trial would permit a reasonable juror to conclude that the accidentpage 348was not random.  the plaintiff's expert testified that the long, running approach to the apex entrance posed a threat precisely because it ""allows you to have a high velocity impact.""  other experts testified that the installation of guardrails or bollards at the apex entrance would have stemmed the impact.moreover, the defendant ""need not have foreseen the precise manner in which the injuries occurred.""  luz v. stop & shop, inc. of peabody,, 204 (1964).  foreseeability is determined from all of the circumstances.  flood, 416 mass. at 72.  as such, it ""is almost always a question for the jury.""  simmons v. monarch mach. tool co.,, 211 (1992).the issue of foreseeability can be resolved as a matter of law only where ""no rational view of the evidence would warrant a finding of [foreseeability].""  glick v. prince italian foods of saugus, inc.,, 902 (1987) (glick).  such is not the case here.cumberland farms relies on glick to urge us to reach a contrary result.  in glick, two patrons brought claims against the defendant after a driver lost control of his vehicle, causing it to leave the adjacent highway at a high rate of speed, travel sixty feet across the parking lot of the defendant's restaurant, jump over an eight inch high cement bumper stop, crash through the wall of the restaurant, and injure them as they dined inside.  id. at 901.  the restaurant did not have outdoor seating or an outsidepage 349service window, the driver was not intentionally on the property, and there was no evidence of prior car strikes at the restaurant.  this court concluded as a matter of law that the defendant could not be held liable because the risk of harm was not reasonably foreseeable.  id. at 902-903.  cumberland farms suggests that the two cases share certain facts, most notably, the unintentional course of travel of both the uncontrolled vehicles off the adjacent public ways at high rates of speed.  the case before us, however, is distinguishable in several material respects.cumberland farms operated a combined convenience store and a gasoline station in chicopee, which, by the very nature of the business, presented a higher level of risk from motor vehicle traffic than the restaurant in glick.  indeed, cumberland farms had experienced numerous car strikes at its stores,including uncontrolled vehicles unintentionally encroaching upon store property at high rates of speed.  it also was on notice that the apex entrance posed particular dangers, and, in fact, vehicles had entered the chicopee store property at dangerously high rates of speed through the apex entrance.  finally, the plaintiff presented sufficient evidence to support a finding that cumberland farms could have employed reasonable preventive measures to address those risks.  all told, therefore, we cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that no rational view of the evidence would warrant a finding of foreseeability.3.  duty of care.  separately, cumberland farms asks us to declare, as a matter of law, that it did not owe kimmy a duty of care.  cumberland farms ""was in possession of real estate open to the public for business purposes.  it owed a duty to a paying patron to use reasonable care to prevent injury to [her] by third persons whether their acts were accidental, negligent, or intentional.""  carey v. new yorker of worcester, inc.,, 452 (1969) (carey).  ""as to any invitee [the store] owed the duty of ordinary care and diligence to maintain its premises in a reasonably safe condition. . . .  what constitutes the required care and diligence is a question of fact.""  luz v. stop & shop, inc. of peabody, 348 mass. at 203.  given the evidence that was presented to the jury, we cannot say that cumberland farms had nopage 350duty as a matter of law.the question, more accurately, is whether we can conclude, as a matter of law, that cumberland farms did not breach that duty.  we do not so conclude.4.  remittitur.  in his cross appeal, the plaintiff challenges the remittitur reducing the verdict from $32 million dollars to $20 million dollars.  ""a judge acting on a motion for remittitur has broad discretion.""  clifton v. massachusetts bay transp. authy.,, 623 (2005) (clifton).  in exercising that broad discretion, a judge may remit so much of the damages as he or she ""adjudges is excessive, in order to bring the award within the range of verdicts supported by the evidence.""  ibid. (quotation omitted).""the assessment of damages is traditionally a factual undertaking appropriate for determination by a jury as the representative voice of the community.""  glavin v. eckman,, 320 (2008).  this is particularly true where the damages available ""are difficult to compute and depend upon the judgment of the fact-finding tribunal in appraising the deprivations and 'translating them into a compensatory sum.'""  maccuish v. volkswagenwerk a.g.,, 398 (1986) (maccuish), quoting from bartley v. phillips,, 40 (1944) (bartley).  in the end, a jury's ""award of damages must stand unless . . . to permit it to stand was an abuse of discretion on the part of the court below, amounting to an error of law.""  reckis v. johnson & johnson,, 299 (2015) (reckis), quoting from labonte v. hutchins & wheeler,, 824 (1997) (labonte).however, a judge may reduce a verdict where the damages awarded were ""greatly disproportionate to the injury proven,"" represent a ""miscarriage of justice,"" or were so large ""that it may be reasonably presumed that the jury, in assessing them, did not exercise a sound discretion, but were influenced by passion, partiality, prejudice or corruption.""  reckis, 471 mass. at 299 (quotations omitted).  all that said, however, it is even rarer for apage 351judge's decision on a remittitur to be set aside on appeal as an abuse of discretion.  see ibid. (such rulings are ""exceedingly rare"" and so seldom found as to be ""almost nonexistent"" [quotation omitted]).  this is not one of those exceedingly rare cases.a.  passion or prejudice.  upon a finding of negligence, cumberland farms was liable under the wrongful death statute for the ""fair monetary value"" of the loss of kimmy to her husband and daughter, including compensation ""for the loss of [her] reasonably expected net income, services, protection, care, assistance, society, companionship, comfort, guidance, counsel, and advice.""  g. l. c. 229, § 2, as appearing in st. 1973, c. 699, § 1.  the plaintiff maintains that the judge's underlying finding that the jury were infected by passion or prejudice was clearly erroneous, thereby rendering the remittitur an abuse of discretion.  the underlying facts are these.during closing argument, the plaintiff suggested one formula the jury could use to translate the losses into a compensatory sum: taking kimmy's present economic value to her family ($1.6 million) and multiplying it by five, thereby netting $8 million.  the jury, however, were required only to indicate the amount of their award in a lump sum on the verdict slip.  it is not possible to determine how much of the $32,369,024.30 award was attributable to any particular loss.  nor is it evident what formula the jury used.when the jury declared that they had reached a verdict, the foreperson sent the judge a note, asking if a statement could be read in open court with the verdict.  after conferring with counsel, the judge brought the jury into the court room and answered that question in the negative.  at his direction, the clerk then proceeded to secure the envelope containing the verdict slip and announce the verdict.  the judge then dismissed the parties and met with the jurors to thank them for their service, whereupon he learned that the statement they had sought to share was on a piece of paper in the envelope with the verdict slip.  he immediately retrieved the envelope and found the statement.  he then brought the parties and jury back into the court room, confirmed what had transpired, and ordered that the statement, which he deemed to have no bearing upon issues of liability or damages, be impounded and shared with no one, including the parties.  after subsequent motions were filed, however, the statement was eventually disclosed.  it read, ""we hope cumberland farms willpage 352acknowledge this as an opportunity to honor the life of kimmy dubuque by investing time and money in the safety of its guests and employees.""following the verdict, cumberland farms filed a motion for remittitur pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 59(a),  365 mass. 827  (1975), arguing that the $32,369,024.30 compensatory damages award had no basis in the evidence and, as evidenced by the jury's statement, was driven by bias or passion.  after holding a hearing and taking the matter under advisement, the judge issued a detailed written decision and concluded that the jury had acted reasonably in finding the defendant negligent, but that the compensatory damages award was excessive.  he found that the award far exceeded what the plaintiff had requested and was disproportionately high compared to the actual evidence of compensatory damages, especially given the absence of any claim that kimmy had endured conscious pain and suffering.  he also found that the jury had, ""to some degree,"" acted out of passion, partiality, or prejudice.  the judge therefore reduced the verdict to $20 million and gave the plaintiff thirty days to accept it or proceed to a new trial on compensatory damages.  ultimately, the plaintiff accepted the reduced award.as noted above, the plaintiff takes issue with the judge's findings that the $32,369,024.30 award was, to some degree, the product of passion, partiality, or prejudice.  the judge was first concerned that the jury had contravened his instructions when they awarded the plaintiff ten dollars in punitive damages.  early in the final charge, the judge had read the text of g. l. c. 229, § 2, to the jury, including the requirement that punitive damages must be ""in an amount of not less than [$5,000].""  the judge, however, did not return to or highlight that requirement when he elaborated on the issue of punitive damages later in the charge.  nor was there any notation on the special verdict form.  in this long and complicated case, with extensive argument and lengthy instructions, the record does not support the finding that the jury ignored the judge's instructions.the judge was also concerned that the jury had rendered an ""inconsistent"" verdict.  according to the verdict slip, ten jurors had found that cumberland farms was negligent, while eleven had found both that its negligence was a substantial contributing factor in kimmy's death and that it had been grossly negligent.  this did not represent an inconsistent or improper verdict.  thepage 353same jurors were not required to vote ""yes"" on every question, so long as at least ten did.  jurors were also free when voting on later questions to do so in the context of the outcome of the vote on earlier questions.the judge was further concerned that, in his view, the jurors ignored his direction that they could not submit a statement to be read in open court, by leaving it in the envelope with the verdict slip.  as noted above, however, he issued his ruling in open court and then immediately directed the clerk to retrieve the envelope and announce the verdict.  there is nothing in the record to suggest that the foreperson had the opportunity, or should have had the presence of mind, to remove the statement from the envelope.  as with the judge's other concerns regarding the verdict slip, this ruling lacked a firm foundation in the record.of course, there was also the note itself.  the substance of the statement was consistent with the jury's verdict on negligence and gross negligence, and does not suggest that the jury were influenced by partiality, prejudice, or corruption.  the judge's stated concerns, viewed individually or collectively, do not support a finding that the jury were influenced by ""passion, partiality, prejudice, or corruption.""  reckis, 471 mass. at 299 (quotation omitted).b.  excessiveness.  nonetheless, in reviewing a ruling on a motion for remittitur, we do not substitute our judgment for that of the judge who heard the evidence and saw the witnesses.  see baudanza v. comcast of mass. i, inc.,, 630 (2009).  the judge also based his remittitur on a second ground, the excessiveness of the verdict.  the plaintiff maintains that the judge erred as a matter of law when he found that the jury's award was greatly disproportionate to the injury proven.  specifically, the plaintiff contends that the judge erred by failing to consider other appellate decisions in wrongful death cases where compensatory damage awards were upheld in amounts that suggest the $32,369,024.30 award was proportional to the evidence.  we decline to engage in the ""dangerous game"" of comparing an award in one case against an award in another.  griffin v. general motors corp.,, 371 (1980) (quotation omitted).  reckis, 471 mass. at 303 n.47.  maccuish, 22 mass. app. ct. at 399.  as the judge noted, his decision was guided by the evidence in this case, not by awards issued in other cases on differentpage 354facts.on this basis, the remittitur may be affirmed.  the judge found that there was ""no evidentiary foundation upon which to conclude that the $32,369,024.30 award represents fair and reasonable compensation to [the plaintiff].  the award is greatly disproportionate to the injury proven. . . .""we cannot conclude that the judge abused his considerable discretion in so finding.5.  new trial.  cumberland farms submits that, in light of the judge's finding that the jury were influenced to some degree by passion, partiality, or prejudice, it is entitled to a new trial on all issues.  as we have already concluded, however, that finding was, to a considerable degree, without support in the record.  still further, to the extent that there was any support for his finding that the jury acted to some degree out of passion, the judge also found that any such error ""concern[ed] the jury's calculation of damages, not their finding on liability or the evidentiary basis for that finding,"" and that there was ""ample"" evidence to support their finding that cumberland farms was negligent and grossly negligent.  having made such a finding, with which we can find no error, it was within his authority to limit relief to the issue of damages.  see simmons v. fish,, 568 (1912); service publications, inc. v. goverman,, 576 (1986).  see also poly v. moylan,, 150 (1996) (ruling on new trial motion must stand absent error of law or abuse of discretion).page 355conclusion.  the amended judgment dated

1659,commonwealth  vs.  courage k. asase.,"practice, criminal, sentence, execution of sentence, probation.a boston municipal court judge erred in denying the commonwealth's motion to revise and revoke a criminal defendant's sentence (three months in a house of correction, suspended for six months, nunc pro tunc to the date of the defendant's conviction, which was more than six months prior to sentencing, and retroactive discharge of the defendant from probation), where the sentence was illegal, in that it did not constitute probation, incarceration, or a fine, and therefore did not fall within the range of permissible punishments for the defendant's offense (assault and battery on a pregnant woman) under the relevant statutes. [357-360]","after jury trial in the district court, the defendant was convicted of assault and battery on a pregnant person.  due to continuances for various reasons, the defendant was not sentenced for over six months after his conviction.  the judge ultimately sentenced the defendant to three months in the house of correction, suspended for six months (during which time the defendant would be on probation), and ordered the sentence imposed nunc pro tunc to the date of the defendant's conviction.  the result was that the defendant was discharged from probation without ever having been placed on probation.  the commonwealth filed a timely motion to revise and revoke the defendant's sentence, which was denied.  this appeal followed.  for the reasonspage 357set forth below, we conclude that the nunc pro tunc probationary sentence was not a lawful sentence.  we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.background.  in september of 2015, a complaint issued against the defendant for assault and battery on a pregnant person (his wife), and intimidation of a witness.  during the pendency of the proceedings, the defendant was free on $500 bail and the condition that he not abuse his wife.  the defendant's wife did not testify at trial, though her statements were admitted through a 911 recording introduced by the commonwealth.  after a two-day jury trial, on april 13, 2016, the defendant was convicted of assault and battery on a pregnant person, and acquitted of intimidation of a witness.  the commonwealth moved for sentencing, and requested that the defendant be sentenced to a three-year term of probation, with conditions including that he complete a certified batterer's intervention program (cbip).  the defendant requested that his conviction be filed for three years, to avoid potential immigration consequences.the judge asked the parties to prepare sentencing memoranda, which were submitted, and the parties reconvened on july 27, 2016.  at that time, the judge requested a further memorandum from the commonwealth specifically addressing the defendant's proposed disposition.  in its response, the commonwealth reasserted its recommendation and objected to placing the defendant's conviction on file, noting that such a disposition could not be imposed without the commonwealth's consent.the judge ultimately set a sentencing date of november 1, 2016, and on that date sentenced the defendant to three months in the house of correction, suspended for six months, nunc pro tunc to april 13, 2016.  in the same order, the judge retroactively discharged the defendant from probation, effective october 13, 2016.the commonwealth filed a motion to revise and revoke the sentence that was dated december 23, 2016, and the judge denied the motion in a memorandum dated january 10, 2017.the commonwealth then appealed from the order denying its motion to this court.page 358discussion.  the commonwealth argues that the nunc pro tunc provision of the defendant's sentence transformed it into ""an illusory sentence,"" and rendered it illegal.""an illegal sentence is one that is not permitted by law for the offense committed.""  commonwealth v. mcguinness,, 475 (1995).  in reviewing a sentence for illegality, ""[w]e begin with the proposition that 'a judge has considerable latitude within the framework of the applicable statute to determine the appropriate individualized sentence.'""  commonwealth v. shea,, 197 (1999), quoting from commonwealth v. goodwin,, 92 (1993).we turn then to the statutes at issue here.  pursuant to g. l. c. 265, § 13a(b)(ii), assault and battery on a pregnant person must be punished by imprisonment or fine, or by both imprisonment and fine.  section 1a of g. l. 279, amended by st. 1975, c. 459, § 1, allows the court to ""direct that the execution of the sentence, or any part thereof, be suspended, and that [the defendant] be placed on probation for such time and on such terms and conditions as it shall fix.""  the probation statute, g. l. c. 276, § 87, further provides that a district court ""may place on probationany person before it charged with an offense or a crime for such time and upon such conditions as it deems proper . . . in any case after a finding or verdict of guilty"" (emphasis added).generally, ""a statute must be interpreted according to the intent of the legislature ascertained from all its words construed by the ordinary and approved usage of the language, considered in connection with the cause of its enactment, the mischief or imperfection to be remedied and the main object to be accomplished, to the end that the purpose of its framers may bepage 359effectuated.""  mcneil v. commissioner of correction,, 821-822 (1994), quoting from board of educ. v. assessor of worcester,, 513 (1975).here, the plain language of the probation statute authorizes a court only to place a defendant on probation ""in the care of its probation officer.""  this requirement is in furtherance of the purpose of the statute.  ""the principal goals of probation are rehabilitation of the defendant and protection of the public,"" with others including ""punishment, deterrence, and retribution.""  commonwealth v. lapointe,, 459 (2001).  ""the purpose of probation rather than immediate execution of a term of imprisonment 'in large part is to enable the [convicted] person to get on his feet, to become law abiding and to lead a useful and upright life under the fostering influence of the probation officer.'""  commonwealth v. wilcox,, 64 (2006), quoting from mariano v. judge of dist. ct. of cent. berkshire,, 93 (1922).""probation obliges a defendant, under the oversight of a probation officer, to comply with the general conditions of probation -- including the obligation to obey all laws, to report to a probation officer, and to notify the officer of a change of address -- as well as any special conditions of probation tailored to the defendant.""  commonwealth v. powers,, 188 (2008) (probation not equivalent to ""mere bond requiring a defendant to keep the peace"").  ""if a defendant violates one or more conditions of probation, a judge may revoke his probation and sentence him to a term of imprisonment for his underlying conviction, or return the defendant to probation, with new or revised conditions.""  commonwealth v. goodwin,, 15 (2010).probation must be ""couple[d]. . . with a supervisory element to ensure that the probationer abides by the probationary terms.""  commonwealth v. taylor,, 626 (1999).  that court supervision is an essential element of probation is not inconsistent with the common use of administrative probation supervision.""administrative supervision has long been recognized as a form of probation supervision and is used when the court intends no direct probation officer intervention beyond the collection of monies and the enforcement of any other specific court order.""page 360commonwealth v. rotonda,, 219 n.12 (2001).  a defendant administratively supervised is nonetheless ""on probation and [is] subject to some less formal type of supervision.""  id.in the case at bar, the nunc pro tunc disposition purported to subject the defendant to probation, which began on the date of his conviction, but encompassed only a term during which the case was continued and he was free on bail with a condition not to abuse the victim.  during this term, the defendant faced the possibility of having his bail revoked for failure to abide by the conditions of release, but he did not face the possibility of revocation of probation, reprobation, imprisonment for his underlying conviction, or other punishment consistent with violation of a lawful probationary sentence.  even where subject to conditions, ""[c]ontinuing [a] case . . . is not the equivalent of probation.""  taylor, 428 mass. at 626 (continuance conditioned on defendant abiding by restraining order and submitting to substance abuse evaluation and counselling not equivalent to probation).  ""probation is a creature of statute . . . with deep roots in the commonwealth.""  wilcox, 446 mass. at 64.  ""artful nomenclature will not turn a statute authorizing probation into authorization for a continuance ruling.  absent this judicial alchemy, g. l. c. 276, § 87, provides no such authority.""  taylor, 428 mass. at 626.  thus, the nunc pro tunc sentence here did not constitute a lawful probationary sentence pursuant to the probation statute.because the defendant's sentence did not constitute a probation, incarceration, or fine, it was not within the range of permissible punishments for the defendant's offense under the relevant statutes, and cannot stand.conclusion.  the order denying the motion to revise and revoke an illegal sentence is reversed.  we remand this case for resentencing.so ordered.",criminal,Myong J.

[364-366]","in this case we consider the legal effect of a series of postdivorce agreements between former spouses which reduced court-ordered alimony, where those agreements were reached without court approval.  after a trial on a complaint for contempt, a probate and family court judge found that the former husband had ""detrimentally relied"" on the postdivorce agreements, and the judge gave effect to those agreements by ""modifying"" the alimony obligation retroactively (but not prospectively) such that the husband was relieved from paying alimonypage 362that had gone unpaid.  the judge also found the husband ""not guilty"" of civil contempt as to the nonpayment of alimony.  we affirm the judgment of no contempt.  however, because the judge's order does not apply the correct legal standard and thus does not provide sufficient findings to support the retroactive modification of alimony, we reverse and remand as to that issue.background.the husband and the wife were married in 1983 and divorced in 2010.  the parties entered into a divorce agreement on april 14, 2010, which set alimony at $650 per week.  the agreement specifically provided that ""matters concerning alimony"" would merge into the divorce judgment, and would be ""modifiable by the [c]ourt in the event of a material change in circumstances.""  the judgment of divorce entered april 26, 2010, and incorporated the divorce agreement with respect to alimony.  between august, 2011, and august, 2015, the husband paid alimony at a rate that was less than the rate set in the divorce agreement.  the husband reduced the amount paid nine separate times, beginning at $2,000 per month in august of 2011, and reducing to, at the end, $800 per month by september of 2014.the judge found that the husband and the wife agreed to these reduced rates.  no complaint for modification was filed with the court in connection with any of the reductions.  in august, 2015, after receiving a letter from the wife's lawyer, the husband resumed paying alimony equal to $650 per week, and thereafter continued to make those payments.  in total, over a roughly four-year period from 2011 to 2015, the husband paid $87,400 less alimony than the amounts called for by the divorce agreement.on march 10, 2016, the wife filed a complaint for contempt, the resolution of which leads to this appeal.  as part of that complaint the wife sought the $87,400 arrearage.  the husband answered that the wife had agreed to the alimony reductions, and that as a result he had made payments to cover costs for their emancipated children that he otherwise would not have made.  he argued that these facts gave rise to defenses of estoppel and laches.  after trial, the judge found the husband ""not guilty"" of civil contempt; she also entered an order ""retroactively modif[ying]"" the husband's alimony obligation so that it matched the amounts he actually paid between 2011 and 2015.  the judge found:page 363""that the parties made agreements with one another at numerous dates between june, 2011[,] and december, 2015[,] for defendant to pay and plaintiff to receive reduced amounts of alimony.  plaintiff testified that she agreed to those changes and further testified that the parties discussed each change either on the telephone or through [electronic mail].  in reliance upon the reductions in alimony, defendant assumed additional financial responsibilities with reference to the parties' children, albeit emancipated children.  defendant paid graduate school tuition for the parties' daughter; he paid monies toward the daughter's wedding; he gave both the daughter and one son money toward a down-payment on their first home; [and] he assisted one son in the payment of liabilities.""the wife appeals.discussion.  1.  contempt.  we first address the charge of contempt.  to prove civil contempt a plaintiff must show two elements:  there must be (1) clear disobedience of (2) a clear and unequivocal command.  see birchall, petitioner,, 852 (2009).  the contempt must be proved by clear and convincing evidence, and the court is to consider ""the totality of the circumstances.""  wooters v. wooters,, 844 (2009).  here, the judge found the husband not in contempt, citing the agreements between the husband and the wife that specifically contemplated that the husband would pay the reduced alimony that he actually paid.we review the judge's ruling that the husband was not in contempt for abuse of discretion, see l.f. v. l.j.,, 821 (2008), and here the ruling must be affirmed.  the wife's position is that because the divorce agreement and judgment was clear as to the husband's alimony obligations and also clear that those obligations could only be modified by court order, a contempt finding must follow essentially as a matter of law, because the husband admittedly did not pay the amount required or obtain modification by the court.  that position cannot be accepted, however, as it would require a finding of contempt based only upon violation of a ""clear and unequivocal command""; the contention ignores the additional requirement that the plaintiff show ""clear and undoubted disobedience.""the case law demonstrates that not every violation of a clear order will constitute contempt, and thus that the requirement topage 364prove ""clear disobedience"" has teeth.  for example, a person cannot be found in contempt of an order to pay money that he or she is unable to pay.  see birchall, petitioner, 454 mass. at 852.  and in wooters, 74 mass. app. ct. at 844, this court ruled that a supporting spouse had failed to pay the alimony required by a court order, but nevertheless ruled that there was no contempt:  ""in our view, the husband's disagreement or misunderstanding of the issue does not constitute clear and undoubted disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.""  while the decision in wooters could be found to rest on either prong of the contempt standard, it plainly stands for the proposition that the violation of an order to pay alimony does not necessarily require a finding of contempt.the husband's actions must be judged in the totality of the circumstances, and here the judge found (1) that the wife had agreed, in advance, to the reductions in alimony, and (2) that in reliance thereon, the husband had made the payments agreed upon and also had changed his behavior, to his detriment, by assuming ""additional financial responsibilities"" with respect to the parties' emancipated children.  it was within the judge's discretion to conclude there was no ""clear and undoubted disobedience"" on these facts.2.  the retroactive alimony modification.  the judge also ordered that ""[t]he defendant's alimony obligation is retroactively modified to the amounts paid through june 14, 2016.""  this modification was based on the same findings that supported the decision that the husband was not in contempt.as noted above, however, the two issues are distinct; a party may not be in contempt, yet still owe alimony under the existing court order.  see wooters, 74 mass. app. ct. at 841-844.  see also poras v. pauling,, 541-543 (2007).  the issue here is whether the judge's retroactive modification is properly supportedpage 365by the judge's findings.the judge's analysis and findings in this case were not sufficient to justify the retroactive modification of alimony.  the relevant analytical framework begins with the supreme judicial court's decision in pierce v. pierce,, 305 (2009), in which the court confirmed that a probate and family court judge has the authority to reduce or eliminate an alimony obligation, even as to alimony payable in arrears.  the court in pierce was confronted with a request to retroactively modify alimony because the supporting spouse had retired, and in that context the court held that retroactive modification was within the judge's discretion, but that the judge must first make findings ""reflecting her consideration of all the factors mandated by g. l. c. 208, § 34.""  id. at 306.  by citing § 34, the pierce court invoked the established framework for setting alimony, which includes a number of considerations such as the length and history of the marriage, the ages of the parties, and the parties' respective financial situations, needs, and earning capabilities.see id. at 295.additionally, prior to the decision in pierce, the case law had also established that an alimony order could only be modified upon a showing of a ""material change of circumstances.""  schuler v. schuler,, 368 (1981).  see binder v. binder,, 754 (1979); kelley v. kelley,, 739-740 (2005).  in general, courts considering modification under this test have looked to the § 34 factors when evaluating the relevant ""circumstances.""  see, e.g., griffith v. griffith,, 945 (1987); kelley, supra at 739 & n.6.because the judge in this case did not address the § 34 factors, the judge's ruling cannot be squared with the pierce case, and the retroactive modification portion of the judgment must be reversed and the matter remanded for additional consideration andpage 366findings.  on remand, the judge should consider and evaluate the factors enumerated in § 34, including whether there has been a ""material change in circumstances"" with respect to those factors since the divorce judgment entered.  in this connection the appropriate circumstances for consideration may include postdivorce conduct of the parties such as are present here, where a former spouse made certain statements and the other spouse detrimentally changed position in reliance thereon.those facts, however, should be considered in the broader context of all the relevant § 34 factors, and any other material postdivorce changes to same.in so ruling, we do not mean to suggest, or to foreclose, any particular outcome after further consideration.we have considered whether the equitable defenses of estoppel and laches, raised by the husband, can provide an independent basis for avoiding a claim for alimony owed in arrears, or whether an analysis of the § 34 factors will always be required.  in this context we believe that those equitable defenses are not independently available.  the case law indicates that laches is not a defense to such claims.  see brash v. brash,, 104-105 (1990) (laches not a defense to an action for the division of property under § 34).  see also bullock v. zeiders,, 636-637 (1981).  as to estoppel, we think the better rule is that any facts which might give rise to an estoppel should be considered in the context of the § 34 factors.  accordingly, even where all the elements of estoppel are shown, the judge must still evaluate the remaining § 34 factors, so that the relevant context is known before determining whether a defendant should be relieved from an unpaid alimony obligation.the judgment finding the husband not guilty of civil contempt is affirmed.  that portion of the judgment retroactively modifyingpage 367the husband's alimony obligations is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.so ordered.",civil,Theresa A.

person shot at a house party at 92 wales street in dorchester.  the shooting occurred a few minutes before the 911 call was placed.  many of the partygoers left the house quickly in response to the shooting.  upon arrival, officers learned from people still inside the first-floor apartment that the victim, rashaan o'neil, was deceased in the basement.  92 wales street is approximately 200 yards from the intersection of wales street and talbot avenue, a main through street in dorchester.at 4:10 a.m., six minutes after the report of the shooting at 92 wales street, boston police were dispatched to respond to a ""shotspotter"" device activationat 276 talbot avenue, at the intersection of talbot avenue and aspinwall road, about one-half mile from 92 wales street.  officer michael peters responded to the scene and found a large area of broken glass in the street at the intersection.  on whitfield street, near its intersection with talbot avenue, about 320 feet from the talbot-aspinwall intersection, officer peters saw a dark-colored four-door jaguar and a kia optima that each had damage consistent with having been in a recent accident.  the rear of the jaguar was only a few feet in from talbot avenue.  the left rear corner of the kia was about onepage 370foot in front of the jaguar's left front corner.  the kia had damage to its rear bumper.  the jaguar had damage to its passenger-side tail light, and to the front driver's side, causing the top of the left front wheel to tilt sharply outward and downward.  from the wheel damage it appeared that the jaguar was inoperable.  both vehicles were protruding at odd angles into the travel lane of whitfield street.  the front of the jaguar was sticking out into the travel lane with its left rear tire next to the curb.  the rear of the kia was sticking out into the travel lane with its left front tire touching the curb.when officer peters first arrived at the scene there was no one in the vicinity of the jaguar and the kia.  after making his initial observations of the vehicles, officer peters walked back to talbot avenue to block traffic.  a short time later, he returned to the talbot-whitfield intersection where the vehicles were located and a man approached him on whitfield street.  the man asked officer peters if he could retrieve his cellular telephone from the jaguar.  the officer responded ""no"" and informed the man that he had to move back from the accident scene.  the man complied and left the scene.  officer peters did not see the man again that night.  at the motion hearing, officer peters identified the defendant as the man who had approached him.while the two scenes were being secured, additional information was relayed to units on scene regarding a potential second gunshot victim, located at carney hospital.  officers dispatched to the hospital observed a tan-colored toyota camry parked outside with a shattered passenger-side window consistent with gunshot damage, and apparent blood on the front seat.  the responding officers located the second victim, zuwena ham, who provided a brief statement during which she admitted that she was inside the basement at 92 wales street at the time of the fatal shooting, standing directly next to o'neil when he was shot.  ham reported that the shooting at the talbot-aspinwall intersection occurred directly after she left the party at 92 wales street in the camry.  there were six occupants in the camry.  when the camry paused to make a left turn from talbot avenue onto aspinwall road, one or more persons in a four-door car fired gunshots at the camry.  ham was shot in the hand.  the driver of the camry, fedelyne maurice, who was also at the party, drove ham to the hospital.  maurice described the shooter's vehicle as a four-door vehicle that was black or possibly dark-colored.upon obtaining information from officers at the two scenes and the hospital, the investigating officers suspected that the 92 walespage 371street shooting, the shooting at the talbot-aspinwall intersection, and the accident at the talbot-whitfield intersection were related.  they treated an area along talbot avenue, including both of these intersections, as an extended crime scene.  officers closed off this entire strip of talbot avenue, putting ""boston police"" tape around the accident scene involving the jaguar and the kia.  a subsequent line search conducted by officers revealed two bullet fragments at the talbot-aspinwall intersection and a shell casing at the intersection of talbot avenue and colonial avenue, about 175 feet from the jaguar.  there appeared to be a tire skid mark leading from the middle of talbot avenue to the jaguar.  sergeant detective paul mclaughlin ordered that the jaguar and kia be towed from the scene to the boston police b-3 station in mattapan.  the vehicles were towed at about 8:12 a.m. on december 25.  a few photographs were taken at the accident scene prior to the vehicles being towed.at about 10:30 a.m. on december 25, the defendant went to the b-3 police station inquiring about the jaguar, identifying himself as the owner.  detective james sheehan spoke with the defendant and told him that the jaguar could not be released at that time since it was being held for an investigation.  the defendant gave detective sheehan his telephone number to call when the investigation was done.  between about 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. on december 26, investigators from the crime scene services unit went to the b-3 station to examine the jaguar and the kia.  they did not search or go into the interior of the cars.  both vehicles remained locked.  only exterior photographs of the jaguar and kia were taken.  paint chips were taken from damaged areas of the exteriors of the vehicles that appeared to be accident impact points.  after the examination was complete, the jaguar was moved from the b-3 police station to a private towing yard.  detective sheehan telephoned the defendant and left a message that the jaguar could now be released to him.on the afternoon of december 26, after the vehicles were examined by the crime scene services unit, detectives obtained and viewed a video recording from a camera at the intersection of talbot avenue and bernard street, between the talbot-wales intersection and the talbot-aspinwall intersection.  the time on the recording leading up to 4:10 a.m. showed a car consistent with a gray jaguar making several turns in the area around wales street and talbot avenue.  the video also showed a car consistent with the tan camry driving on talbot avenue toward aspinwall road.  the car that looked like the jaguar approached at a highpage 372speed behind the camry from the direction of wales street.  at or just before 4:10 a.m., the two cars on the video were continuing southeast toward aspinwall road and went out of the camera's view before reaching aspinwall road.  after viewing the video, sergeant detective paul mclaughlin completed an affidavit in support of a search warrant for the jaguar.  the detectives had the jaguar moved from the private tow yard to the b-2 police station in roxbury.  a superior court judge issued a search warrant on december 26.  officers searched the jaguar on december 27 under the authority of the warrant.  items obtained from the jaguar in the warrant search included two shell casings, clothing items, beverage bottles, fingerprints, a piece of plastic molding, photographs of the exterior and interior of the car, personal papers, and the jaguar's event data recorder and supplemental restraint system control module.discussion.  1.  motion to suppress.  the defendant argues that the jaguar was seized shortly after 4:10 a.m. when he was denied access to his vehicle to retrieve his cellular telephone.  the defendant claims that at that time, the police lacked probable cause to seize his car without a warrant.  as such, the defendant asserts that the evidence found in the initial search of the exterior of the jaguar and the search pursuant to the warrant must be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful seizure and search of the vehicle that happened before the search warrant was issued.  while we agree with the defendant that at the time when officer peters denied him access to the jaguar, the police had seized the vehicle by asserting control over and interfering with his property rights, see commonwealth v. connolly,, 819-823 (2009), we disagree that there was a lack of probable cause to justify the warrantless seizure.""a warrantless search or seizure is presumptively unreasonable unless it falls under a recognized exception to the warrant requirement.""  commonwealth v. a juvenile (no. 2),, 162 (1991).  a warrantless seizure must be based on probable cause.  see commonwealth v. hason,, 174 (1982).  ""probable cause exists where 'the facts and circumstances within . . . [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that' an offense has been or is being committed.""  brinegar v. united states, 338 u.s. 160, 175-176 (1949), quoting from carroll v. united states, 267 u.s. 132, 162 (1925).page 373here, the police were initially dispatched to the talbot-aspinwall intersection at 4:10 a.m. in response to a shotspotter activation.  upon arrival, officer peters saw a large area of broken glass in the street at that intersection.  approximately 320 feet from the intersection, he observed the jaguar and the kia.  the jaguar was just inside the corner and pointing away from talbot avenue towards whitfield street, with the kia about one foot in front.  the appearance of the vehicles indicated that the jaguar and the kia had been in a recent collision.  the kia had rear-end damage, and the jaguar had both rear and front-end damage that caused the left front wheel to sharply bend.  both vehicles were protruding at odd angles into the travel lane on whitfield street.the physical appearance of the jaguar, and its proximity to the location of the shotspotter activation and broken glass, as well as the temporal proximity between the activation and recent motor vehicle accident, occurring in or around 4:00 a.m. on christmas morning, when few other vehicles were likely on the road, provided a sufficient nexus between the incriminating evidence in plain view and the accident scene.  this afforded the police with probable cause to secure the scene and prevent public access to the restricted area while they continued to search the vicinity for evidence.by 8:12 a.m., when the vehicle was towed and impounded, the officers had gathered additional evidence which gave them further probable cause to believe that the accident between the jaguar and the kia was connected to the two shootings and that a search of the jaguar would produce more related evidence.  the shooting at the wales street party occurred six minutes before and one-half mile away from the shooting at the talbot-aspinwall intersection.  at least two of the women who were shot at in the camry had just left the party at 92 wales street.  ham, the woman who was struck in the hand by one of the bullets, was standing next to o'neil in the basement when he was fatally shot.  the driver of the camry described the shooter's vehicle as a four-doorpage 374vehicle that was black or possibly dark-colored.  the jaguar, located about 320 feet from the talbot-aspinwall intersection where the spotshotter was activated, matched the description of the motor vehicle involved in the nonfatal shooting.  further searches in the vicinity revealed a tire skid mark that led from the center of talbot avenue toward the jaguar, two bullet fragments, and a discarded shell casing about 175 feet from the jaguar.this additional evidence, and reasonable inferences, supported a belief that the jaguar had been rapidly traveling down talbot avenue prior to hitting the kia.  the motion judge properly determined that the proximity of the jaguar, in time and location, to the two shootings showed a possible link that was enough to justify a search of the vehicle pursuant to the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  see commonwealth v. gentile,, 573-575 (2002).  when an automobile is stopped on a public way and probable cause exists to search it, the inherent mobility of the motor vehicle provides the exigency necessary to justify a warrantless search.  commonwealth v. motta,, 124 (1997).  ""the inherent mobility of motor vehicles . . . and the reduced expectation of privacy associated with them . . . justify application of the vehicular exception '[e]ven in cases where an automobile [is] not immediately mobile.'""  commonwealth v. nicholson,, 607 n.7 (2003), quoting from united states v. mccoy, 977 f.2d 706, 710 (1st cir. 1992).the photographs and removal of paint chips from the jaguar at the police station were proper as ""the facts constituting probable cause to make the search continued to exist"" after the vehicle had been towed to the b-3 station.  commonwealth v. rand,, 561 (1973).  see id. at 560 (""the physical appearance of the car, its proximity to the scene of the hit and run, and the damage to its front end which was consistent with the type of damage expected to the hit-and-run vehicle provided sufficient nexus between the incriminating evidence in plain view and the hit-and-run accident to constitute probable cause to search the automobile for further evidence of the hit and run"").  accordingly, we are of the opinion that the officers had probable cause to believe that there would be evidence relating to the shootings at 92 wales street and the talbot-aspinwall intersection in or on the jaguar, so as to satisfy the automobile exception.  the officers subsequently developed further probable cause and searched the interior of the vehicle pursuant to a valid warrant.  the motion topage 375suppress was properly denied.2.  sentencing.  we likewise discern no merit in the defendant's challenge to his sentences.  this court reviews sentences already appealed to the appellate division of the superior court for ""errors of law or constitutional violations.""  commonwealth v. grimshaw,, 513 (1992).  ""a sentencing judge has great discretion within the statutorily prescribed range 'to fashion an appropriate[,] individualized sentence.'""  commonwealth v. cole,, 302 (2014), quoting from commonwealth v. mills,, 399 (2002).  ""[a] sentencing judge may not undertake to punish the defendant for any conduct other than that for which the defendant stands convicted in the particular case.""  commonwealth v. leblanc,, 221 (1976).  a judge may consider a variety of factors, including ""the defendant's behavior, character, background, and, perhaps most important, 'the nature of the offense and the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime.'""  commonwealth v. jones,, 572 (2008), quoting from commonwealth v. derouin,, 970 (1992).the jury found the defendant not guilty of the murder of o'neil, but guilty of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shooting ham, assault by means of a dangerous weapon, and unlawful possession of a firearm.  the trial judge's sentences fell well within the ranges permitted by statute.  see g. l. c. 265, §§ 15a(b), 15b(b); g. l. c. 269, § 10(a).  the judge's comments during sentencing show that she considered the nature of the offenses and the circumstances surrounding the defendant's crimes in fashioning an appropriate sentence, not that she intended to punish the defendant for the murder of which he was acquitted.  we discern no error and are confident that the sentencing judge relied solely on legally acceptable criteria in imposing sentence in this case.judgments affirmed.",criminal,Charles J.

""[t]there are two layers of intent required to prove civil harassment under c. 258e:  the acts of harassment must be wilful and '[m]alicious,' the latter defined as 'characterized by cruelty, hostility or revenge,' and they must be committed with 'the intent to cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property.'""  o'brien v. borowski,, 420 (2012), quoting from g. l. c. 258e, § 1.discussion.  on appeal, the plaintiff asserts that there was evidence of more than three acts of harassment raised and proved before the judge.  upon review of the record, including the complaint, the plaintiff's affidavit in support of the complaint, and the transcripts of the november 16 and november 22 hearings, the plaintiff arguably alleged the existence of five incidents.  specifically, he presented evidence that the defendant had one of his employees fly a drone over the plaintiff's property on at least three occasions; that on one such occasion the drone flew ""in front of"" or in the ""line of sight"" of a contractor operating heavy machinery; and that, on at least two occasions, persons entered the property to ""video the site"" at the direction of the defendant.  as to the drone in the ""line of sight"" incident, there is no indication in the record as to the proximity of the drone to any worker or machinery.  this evidence fell short of justifying the order.initially, the parties dispute whether the alleged harassment was ""aimed at a specific person"" as required by the plain language of g. l. c. 258e, § 1, inserted by st. 2010, c. 23, defining ""[h]arassment,"" in relevant part, as ""[three] or more acts of willful and malicious conduct aimed at a specific person.""  the defendant contends that the conduct was, at most, aimed at property or a worker thereon.  the plaintiff counters that we can infer from the circumstances that the defendant's directives were intended to target the plaintiff.  see demayo v. quinn,, 117 (2015).  in view of the long-standing and ongoing personal and legal quarrel between the parties, the alleged efforts by the defendant to impede the plaintiff's development of the property, and the timing and scope of the conduct at issue, we will assume without deciding that the plaintiff's inferencepage 379is warranted in the instant case.  that notwithstanding, the sparse evidence proffered by the plaintiff does not support a finding that the acts were wilful and malicious or that their ""'entire course . . . ' caused 'fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property.'""  seney v. morhy,, 63 (2014), quoting from o'brien, supra at 426 n.8.  thus, as we discuss below, reversal of the order denying the motion to vacate is required.there is no evidence in the record, and we cannot infer, that the defendant's actions were actually intended to cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property as those terms have been defined in our case law.  see gassman, 90 mass. app. ct. at 9.  see also o'brien, 461 mass. at 430.  the plaintiff maintains that the incident involving the drone flying in the ""line of sight"" of an operator of heavy machinery, viewed in context of the history of litigation between the parties, was sufficient to meet the statutory requirements delineated above.  we disagree.  we are unpersuaded that the mere existence of litigation permits the inference that the defendant acted maliciously within the meaning of c. 258e, let alone that he intended to cause fear, intimidation, abuse, or damage to property, in regard to that incident or the others.moreover, flying drones over or trespassing onto the property to videotape the worksite, viewed separately or as a whole, does not constitute harassment within the meaning of c. 258e.  a line of precedent clarifies that this category of conduct, however nettlesome, does not justify the issuance of a c. 258e order.  see, e.g., seney, supra at 63-64; van liew v. stansfield,, 38-39 (2016); gassman, 90 mass. app. ct. at 8-9; c.e.r. v. p.c.,, 126 (2017).  contrast a.t. v. c.r.,, 533-537 (2015) (sufficient evidence of a pattern of harassment where the defendant made an inappropriate sexual comment to the plaintiff, threatened to make her life a ""living hell"" if she told anyone about it, discussed his sexualpage 380fantasy about her in front of their school class, and threatened to punch her in the breasts); v.j. v. n.j.,, 23-28 (2017) (sufficient evidence of at least three separate incidents of harassment where the defendant approached the plaintiff from behind and grabbed her across her chest in a ""bear hug"" as if attempting to ""abduct"" her, verbally assaulted her by calling her names and threatening her job, and refused to leave absent removal by police).while the defendant's actions may have been disruptive or ""abusive"" in an idiomatic sense, it falls well short of satisfying the two layers of intent mandated by our jurisprudence.see o'brien, 461 mass. at 420; c.e.r., 91 mass. app. ct. at 131-132 (""the defendants' conduct -- while boorish and no doubt upsetting and logistically and financially problematic for the plaintiff -- did not constitute 'harassment' within the meaning of c. 258e"").  see also gassman, 90 mass. app. ct. at 8 (""the inclination to issue an order for the parties to stay away from one another, concluding that such an order cannot do any harm, is understandable.  nonetheless, harassment prevention orders issued pursuant to g. l. c. 258e carry significant collateral consequences for a defendant"").  in short, there was insufficient evidence to support the issuance of the c. 258e order.  see seney, 467 mass. at 63-64.conclusion.  accordingly, the order entered february 14, 2017, denying the motion to vacate the c. 258e order is reversed.so ordered.",civil,None,reverse

[384-385]at the trial of a petition pursuant to g. l. c. 123a, § 12(b), to commit the defendant as a sexually dangerous person, the superior court judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the results of a penile plethysmograph test conducted by the defendant's retained expert, where such test results were neither expressly made admissible by statute nor an essential part of the qualified examiners' evaluation under the statute, and accordingly they required assessment by the judge of their independent admissibility [385-386]; and where the defendant failed to establish the reliability of the test as used by the expert, in that the judge did not err in finding that the general acceptance of the test was limited to its use in the treatment rather than diagnosis of sex offenders, in that the record amply supported the judge's conclusion that the defendant failed to establish the reliability of the test using alternate methods (i.e., the test lacked a standard set of stimuli or agreed-upon standards and the test was vulnerable to manipulation), and in that the defendant offered no evidence suggesting the test's value in proving the negative proposition that the absence of deviant response on the test correlated with an absence of sexual recividivsm or of a relevant diagnosis. [386-389]","following a superior court jury trial on the commonwealth's petition pursuant to g. l. c. 123a, § 12(b), the defendant, lucas ortiz, was found to be a sexually dangerous person (sdp) as defined by g. l. c. 123a, § 1, and was ordered committed to the massachusetts treatment center.  on appeal, thepage 382defendant claims that the trial judge improperly excluded the results of a penile

within his discretion in finding that the defendant failed to show that the absence of deviant arousal on the ppg as conducted by the examining expert is a reliable basis for diagnosis or predictions of future sexual dangerousness, we affirm.background.  at the time of trial, the defendant was thirty-nine years old.  in 1992, when the defendant was seventeen years old, he was a member of a boy scout troop.  during this time, he committed sexual offenses against four younger boy scouts who were between the ages of eleven and thirteen years old.  during each of the offenses, the defendant told the child that he had a son who was taken by kidnappers and that his son's release would be facilitated by the child having sexual intercourse with the defendant.  in one of the offenses, the defendant threatened the boy with a knife.  in 1993, the defendant committed an additional sexual offense against a twelve year old boy using the ruse of conducting a physical exam of the child as a condition to becoming a member of a gang.as a result of these offenses, the defendant was convicted of multiple counts of rape of a child and indecent assault and battery on a child, and one count of assault by means of a dangerous weapon.  he was incarcerated for two years, and in 1995 he was released on probation.  as a condition of his probation, the defendant was ordered to have no unsupervised contact with individuals under the age of eighteen.within six months of his release from incarceration, the defendant befriended a fifteen year old boy.  while alone in a car with the boy, the defendant demanded that the boy perform oral sex on him, and threatened him at knifepoint.the defendant was found to have violated his probation on the earlier offenses, and ultimately was convicted of indecent assault and battery, assault and battery, and assault by means of a dangerous weapon.  the defendant continued to be incarcerated through 2012, at which time the commonwealth filed the instant petition in anticipation of his release from custody.page 383pursuant to g. l. c. 123a, § 13(a), the defendant was examined by two qualified examiners.  each of the examiners prepared reports opining that the defendant was sexually dangerous pursuant to the statute and likely to reoffend sexually.  the qualified examiners each diagnosed the defendant with pedophilia, as well as other sexual and personality disorders relevant to his likelihood of reoffending.the defendant was also examined by two experts retained by him.  a psychologist specializing in neuropsychology examined the defendant and opined that he suffered from no diagnosable mental illness.  a second psychologist, dr. joseph plaud, opined that the defendant could not be diagnosed with a sexually-based mental disorder or personality disorder.dr. plaud's opinion relied in part on his examination of the defendant using a ppg.  he reported that when examined, the defendant displayed sexual arousal to adult consensual sexual scenarios, and did not display deviant arousal to children.prior to trial, the commonwealth filed a motion to exclude from evidence the results of the ppg test conducted by dr. plaud, arguing that the test was not reliable and that, regardless, the commonwealth had not received timely notice of the evidence.the trial judge conducted a daubert-lanigan hearing midtrial.at the hearing, the defendant presented only the testimony of dr. plaud.  dr. plaud testified that the ppg is a device designed to measure an individual's pattern of arousal in response to different sexual stimuli.  the device acts by using a mercury and rubber band to measure changes in the tumescence of the penis.  when dr. plaud conducts testing, the device is applied by the individual being tested, without his supervision.the stimuli used in the exam are not standardized, and dr. plaud testified that he had developed his own set.  although many treatment programs use solely auditory stimuli, dr. plaud uses both auditory and visual stimuli.  dr. plaud conceded that the test was subject to manipulation by intentional failure to pay attention to the stimulus, but indicated that he had devised certain measures to avoid this, such as requiring a subject to respond to dots appearing on the screen at random intervals.  dr. plaud indicatedpage 384that medications could affect test results as well.dr. plaud agreed that false positives and false negatives are an issue with the ppg, and had previously written in an article that the ppg has a false positive error rate of about thirty-five percent.  about one-third of sexual offenders show no arousal pattern in response to the exam, and ""the vast majority of rapists"" show no deviant arousal according to the exam.  although dr. plaud testified that studies have correlated deviant arousal as measured by the ppg with increased levels of recidivism, he was not aware of any studies demonstrating that lack of deviant sexual arousal was correlated with the absence of reoffense.dr. plaud testified that there are ""thousands and thousands and thousands"" of studies using the ppg.  during the hearing, however, the defendant did not submit any scholarly articles in evidence.  neither the machine itself nor photographs of it were submitted to the court during the hearing, nor were the stimuli dr. plaud used with the defendant.  dr. plaud testified that he administered the ppg to the defendant using fifteen stimulus images.  he was not aware of whether the defendant took any medication that would affect the test results.after the hearing, the judge excluded the ppg evidence, issuing a written memorandum after the conclusion of the trial.  the defendant was permitted to call dr. plaud to testify without discussing the ppg, and references to the ppg examination were redacted from his written report.the defendant now argues that, in the circumstances of this case, the daubert-lanigan standards are inapplicable in considering the admissibility of the ppg evidence, and that, even if such standards applied, the ppg evidence was improperly excluded.discussion.  1.  standard of review.

state v. gallegos, 220 p.3d 136, 145 (utah 2009) (merely finding that, at trial on charges of enticing a minor, defendant's pedophilia or lack thereof was relevant, without deciding scientific validity of ppg test).a lack of general acceptance does not end our inquiry into reliability.  the judge conducted a more generalized reliability inquiry to determine whether the test has been shown ""reliable or valid through other means.""  ready, petitioner,, 174 (2005).  we find ample support in the record for the judge's conclusion that the defendant did not establish the reliability of the ppg using alternate methods.at the outset, the ppg's lack of a standard set of stimuli or agreed-upon standards for the testing creates, as the judge found, a ""major problem.""  for a test such as this, the stimuli used are by definition intrinsic to the result produced.  with no standardized guidelines for either the content or even the mechanism of stimulus (audio or visual), the reliability of the procedure appears inherently dubious.  see ready, 63 mass. app. ct. at 176-177 (variance in stimuli used in abel assessment for sexual interest test studies eroded validity of the studies).  indeed, the test has a significant error rate, according to dr. plaud, with false positives above thirty-three percent, and potential false negatives amongst ""the vast majority of rapists.""  see id. at 178 (judge found test's error rate of twenty-one to thirty-two percent unacceptable).of similar concern is the test's vulnerability to manipulation by the subject, who may opt to direct his thoughts or attention elsewhere than intended by the examiner.  although dr. plaud testified that he takes measures to avoid certain types of testpage 389manipulation, the defendant did not present any evidence suggesting that these measures have been studied, that they have been determined to be effective, or that they are generally accepted as effective by others in the clinical community.finally, as the judge noted, the defendant did not offer any evidence suggesting the ppg's value in proving a negative proposition:  that an absence of deviant response on the ppg is correlated with an absence of sexual recidivism.  he similarly offered no evidence on the correlation between absence of deviant response and absence of a relevant diagnosis.based on our review of the record before the judge, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the ppg examination results; it has not been established that use of the ppg exam to show the likelihood of sexual reoffense is generally accepted in the clinical community or that a review of the daubert-lanigan factors favors admission of evidence based on such an exam.judgment affirmed.",civil,Robert C.

appeals of saugus,, 362-363 (1972), where the plaintiff timely filed a notice of the appeal with the town clerk but did not include a copy of the complaint.  in garfield v. board of appeals of rockport,, 39 (1969), the plaintiffs delivered notice that they had filed an appeal and a copy of the complaint to the town clerk at her home at 6:35 p.m. on the last day of the appeal period, after the town offices had closed.  the court held that delivery to the clerk at her home satisfied the notice requirement.  ibid.finally, in the circumstances closest to those in the present case, notice was deemed adequate in konover, supra.  in that case, counsel for the plaintiff had prepared two sets of papers for service at town hall -- one for service on the board and the other for delivery to the town clerk.  id. at 320-321.  both were placed together in a sealed envelope marked ""summonses to the auburn planning board in the town of auburn.""  id. at 320.  the process server, unaware that the envelope contained two sets of papers, left the sealed envelope with the secretary to the town planner.  ibid.  days later, but within the appeals period, the town planner opened the envelope and walked across the hall to the town clerk's office where he told the clerk and an assistant town clerk that he had received the plaintiff's complaint.  id. at 321.  he showed the assistant town clerk the front page of the complaint -- ""to see if she received what i had received"" -- which she had not.  ibid.  after that, the town planner placed all of the documents he had received into a file in the board's office, and no formal notice of the appeal was ever filed with the town clerk.  id. at 322.  in concluding that the requirements of § 17 had been met, the court observed that the ""key element"" in cases ""relaxing the rigors of strict compliance with the zoning appeal statute"" is that within the twenty-day statutory appeal period ""the clerk is actually notified that an appeal -- i.e., a complaint -- has in fact been timely filed,"" id. at 324-325, and that ""it is the state of the clerk's knowledge, not the physical location of the papers, thatpage 394controls.""ibid.as we have observed, in the present case it is established that the clerk knew sometime before may 4, 2016, that the plaintiffs had filed a complaint in the land court appealing the april 24, 2016, decision of the board.  since it is the state of the clerk's knowledge that controls, the requirements of g. l. c. 40a, § 17, were satisfied, and the order allowing the defendant's summary judgment motion was error.judgment reversed.it is undisputed that the plaintiffs failed to give timely ""[n]otice of the action with a copy of the complaint"" to the town clerk as required by g. l. c. 40a, § 17.  nonetheless, they were able to depose the town clerk, the assistant town clerk and the town planner in an effort to establish that the town clerk had actual knowledge of the filing of their complaint.  i believe this inquiry into the ""actual knowledge"" of the clerk removes the burden from where it properly should be placed, squarely on the shoulders of the plaintiffs.  where a party has failed in its statutory notice obligation, local officials should not be drawn into litigation.i acknowledge that dismissal of an appeal is a severe sanction for failure to give timely notice to the town clerk, particularly where it appears that the plaintiffs timely filed a complaint in court to challenge the decision of the local zoning board of appeals.  given that the requirement of g. l. c. 40a, § 17, is a jurisdictional requisite to judicial review, however, see garfield v. board of appeals of rockport,, 39 (1969), this requirement must be enforced even where it leads to harshpage 395results.see bjornlund v. zoning bd. of appeals of marshfield,, 757 (1967); o'blenes v. zoning bd. of appeals of lynn,, 558-559 (2001); costello v. board of appeals of lexington,, 442 (1975); bingham v. city council of fitchburg,, 566-567 (2001).the hickeys argue that their failure to serve the town clerk with notice of their appeal should be excused because the assistant town clerk was told by the town planner that he had received the hickeys' complaint.  in doing so, they rely primarily on konover mgmt corp. v. planning board of auburn,(1992) (konover).under the circumstances recited in konover, this court held that the plaintiff had adequately complied with g. l. c. 40a, § 17.  in so doing, we found that the ""key element"" in cases ""relaxing the rigors of strict compliance with the zoning appeal statute"" is that within the appeals period ""the clerk is actually notified that an appeal -- i.e., a complaint, has in fact been timely filed.""  id. at 324-325.  referring to garfield, supra, the konover court wrote, ""[t]he decision makes it clear that it is the state of the clerk's knowledge, not the physical location of the papers, that controls.""  konover, supra at 325.  in garfield, however, the court did not discuss the state of the clerk's personal knowledge as a basis for its decision.  instead, the court relied on the statutory language --page 396emphasizing that, in contrast to g. l. c. 40a's provisions for filing the board's decision ""in the office of the city or town clerk,"" the language relevant to judicial appeals required only that notice be given ""to . . . (the) city or town clerk,"" and did not require filing in the clerk's ""office.""  garfield, supra at 39.there is, however, another ""key element"" that is apparent from konover and the cases cited therein -- which is that, before the notice requirement had been ""relaxed,"" there had been an attempt by the plaintiff to provide the clerk with written notice of the appeal by some reasonably effective (albeit imperfect) means.  see konover, supra at 321 (counsel sent out notice packet for service on town clerk).  see also, mclaughlin v. rockland zoning board of appeals,, 679 (1967) (complaint was delivered to town clerk without a notice of filing); garfield, 356 mass. at 39 (notice and copy of complaint were delivered to clerk at home, after close of business); carr v. board of appeals of saugus,, 361 (1972) (notice of filing was delivered to town clerk without complaint).moreover, in all of these cases, the clerk's ""actual knowledge"" of the appeal has been linked in some way to the attempt by the plaintiff to serve her with notice.see konover, supra at 321 (town planner received notice intended for clerk and informed clerk that appeal had been filed).  see also, mclaughlin, supra at 679; carr, supra at 361; garfield, supra at 39.in other words, in my view, konover does not stand for the proposition that a clerk's actual knowledge of a pending appeal is necessarily dispositive of the jurisdictional question, regardless of the source from which that knowledge might flow.such an exception, in all cases where the clerk has learned of an appeal bypage 397some happenstance independent of the plaintiff's efforts at perfecting the appeal, could negate entirely the statutory requirement that timely notice be provided to the clerk.  moreover, such an exception would have the effect of requiring town clerks (as well as other town officials) to submit to litigation discovery in every instance where the plaintiff has failed to give the formal notice required by the statute.while konover and garfield ""expanded the manner in which the deadline could be met,"" see bingham, supra at 571, i do not believe this expansion is broad enough to encompass this situation where there has been no attempt by the plaintiff to provide the written notice to the clerk required by the statute.written notice is contemplated by the statute's reference to ""notice of the action with a copy of the complaint.""  g. l. c. 40a, § 17.  see county of norfolk v. zoning board of appeals of walpole,, 930 (1983) (telephone notice that an appeal will be taken is nugatory because it puts nothing in the record by which interested third parties would be forewarned that the zoning status of the land is still in question).  by relying on an oral representation to satisfy the notice requirement to the town clerk, the majority further extends the exceptions to the rule. see mclaughlin, supra (copy of complaint filed with clerk); garfield, supra (notice of appeal and copy of complaint delivered to clerk); carr, supra (notice of appeal filed with clerk); konover, supra (copy of complaint shown to clerk).for these reasons, i would hold that a plaintiff seeking judicialpage 398zoning review is not entitled to the benefit of the town clerk's personal knowledge for purposes of satisfying g. l. c. 40a, § 17, unless that knowledge can reasonably be connected to a timely attempt to provide formal, written notice to the clerk by some reasonably effective means.  such a rule is consistent with konover, where the court emphasized the details of the plaintiffs' counsel's attempted service on the clerk's office, and found that his failure to do so was a ""'relatively innocuous' misstep that was not 'so repugnant to the procedural scheme, so destructive of its purposes, as to call for dismissal.""konover, supra at 327, quoting from schulte v. director of the div. of employment sec.,, 79 (1975).here, because the plaintiffs served only the board and  made no attempt to provide separate notice to the town clerk, as required by the statute, i believe the appeal was properly dismissed by the land court.  see pasqualino v. board of appeals of wareham,, 990 (1982).  i would affirm.",civil,Gary A.

[401-402]at the trial of a criminal complaint charging open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, in violation of g. l. c. 272, § 16, evidence that a witness who saw the defendant wearing a sock-like object over his genitals with his buttocks exposed and otherwise completely naked felt ""shocked"" and ""just a little disgusted"" was sufficient, although a close question, to establish that the witness's reaction was objectively reasonable, and that the witness was in fact shocked or alarmed by the defendant's exposure. [402-403]at the trial of a criminal complaint charging open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, in violation of g. l. c. 272, § 16, there was no error in the admission of a witness's testimony as to her observations of children in the area where she saw the defendant wearing a sock-like object over his genitals with his buttocks exposed and otherwise completely naked, given that the commonwealth had the right to present the witness's account of the circumstances in which she made her observations. [403-404]at the trial of a criminal complaint charging open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior, in violation of g. l. c. 272, § 16, the omission of an instruction on an essential element of the crime, i.e., the objective component of open and gross lewdness - announced for the first time in a supreme judicial court decision approximately three months after the conclusion of the trial - created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice; accordingly, the defendant was entitled to a new trial. [404-407]","as pertinent here, the statute punishing ""open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,"" g. l. c. 272, § 16, has remained unchanged for more than 230 years.  see commonwealth v. quinn,, 495 & n.7 (2003), citing st. 1784, c. 40, § 3.  however, during that time, the definition of the crime has ""evolved through our decisional law.""  commonwealth v. maguire,, 158 (2017).  the maguire decision represents the most recent ""judicial construction"" of the statute.  id. at 161, quoting from commonwealth v. ora,, 128 (2008).  in maguire, the court announced that one of the five elements of the offense (element four) requires the commonwealth to prove an ""objective component,"" namely, that the defendant's conduct not only caused one or more persons to be shocked or alarmed, but in addition, ""that 'shock' or 'alarm' was an objectively reasonable reaction in the circumstances of the conduct.""  maguire, supra at 161.this requirement does not appear in any previously reported massachusetts appellate decision.  not surprisingly, the jury in this case were not instructed in accordance with maguire, which was decided approximately three months after the conclusion of the defendant's trial.  we conclude that the absence of such an instruction created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and accordingly reverse the defendant's conviction of open and gross lewdness.background.  taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, commonwealth v. latimore,,page 401676-677 (1979), the jury could have found the following facts.on august 9, 2015, a twenty-seven year old female witness, n.m., was out for a boat ride on the charles river with her father and some friends.  the boat was tied up in front of the hatch shell on the esplanade, which is owned by the department of conservation and recreation, patrolled by the state police, and open to the public.  n.m. noticed two children, between the ages of five and seven, who were riding scooters.  they stopped suddenly and turned their heads toward something.  when she followed their gaze to see what had caught their attention, she saw an individual, later identified as the defendant, walking in a ""casual strut"" down the walkway on the esplanade.  he walked the way models walk down the runway, to ""let everybody see the outfit.""  the defendant was wearing a black sock-like object over his genitals, held in place by three strings in the shape of a ""t.""  n.m. described it as a ""banana hammock.""  the defendant's buttocks were exposed and he was otherwise completely naked.when n.m. saw the defendant, she felt ""shocked"" and ""just a little disgusted.""  she explained that she ""wouldn't expose that to anybody,"" and further described what she had seen as ""just a little unnerving.""  she testified that her reaction was based, in part, on the fact that there were children in the area who also saw the defendant.  she took a photograph of the defendant, which was admitted into evidence.  n.m. then decided to flag down a state police trooper passing by to report what she had seen.  as the trooper, david twomey, approached the defendant, he quickly turned away and put on his pants.  the defendant appeared nervous, as ""his eyebrows were twitching and he was stuttering.""  he told twomey that he was sunbathing.discussion.  1.  sufficiency of the evidence.  the defendant argues on appeal that the commonwealth's evidence was not sufficient to prove that his behavior was objectively and subjectively shocking or alarming as required by maguire.initially, we must determine whether the interpretation of the open and grosspage 402lewdness statute announced in maguire is applicable to the case before us.  ""where a decision does not announce new common-law rules or rights but rather construes a statute, no analysis of retroactive or prospective effect is required because at issue is the meaning of the statute since its enactment.""  mcintire, petitioner,, 261 (2010).  see id. at 262 n.7.  maguire is applicable in the instant case because the court, through the process of judicial construction, explained that the open and gross lewdness statute contains an objective component.the question for us thus becomes ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt"" (emphasis omitted).  latimore, 378 mass. at 677.  ""the inferences drawn from [the] evidence need only be reasonable and possible, not necessary or inescapable.""  commonwealth v. morgan,, 349 (2007) (quotation omitted).  see commonwealth v. bush,, 30 (1998).a.  objective component of ""shock"" or ""alarm.""  the fourth element of the crime of open and gross lewdness, as defined anew in maguire, requires the commonwealth to ""demonstrate that 'shock' or 'alarm' was an objectively reasonable reaction in the circumstances of the conduct.""  maguire, 476 mass. at 161.  whether a person's reaction is reasonable based on the circumstances is typically a question to be determined by the fact finder.  see ibid.  see also trenz v. norwell,, 275 (2007) (""reasonableness is a question of fact for the [fact finder] whose decision is based on consideration of all the relevant circumstances"" [quotation omitted]).although we regard this as a close question, reasonable minds could differ as to whether n.m.'s reaction to the defendant's deliberate exposure of his buttocks in a public area was objectively reasonable.thus, the commonwealth should have the opportunitypage 403to present its case to a properly instructed jury, at a new trial.b.  subjective component of ""shock"" or ""alarm.""  the fifth element of proof requires the commonwealth to demonstrate that at least one person was in fact shocked or alarmed by the defendant's exposure.  see quinn, 439 mass. at 501; commonwealth v. botev,, 287-288 (2011).  ""where an 'observer suffered significant negative emotions as a result of the exposure,' the observer's reaction 'could justifiably be deemed alarm or shock,' . . . [sufficient] to convict a defendant of open and gross lewdness.""  commonwealth v. pereira,, 347 (2012), quoting from commonwealth v. kessler,, 775 (2004).  ""[t]he fact finder may consider not only the words used by the witness, but also other indicia of the witness's emotional state"" in determining whether the observer suffered significant negative emotions as a result of the defendant's actions.  pereira, supra.  one such indicium is ""whether the witness immediately reported the incident.""  commonwealth v. militello,, 334 (2006).here, n.m. testified that she was ""shocked"" and ""just a little disgusted"" by the defendant's exposure.  she found it ""[a] little nerve racking"" both because she had never seen anything similar before and because there were children around.  indeed, she took a photograph of what she had seen and flagged down twomey.  while n.m. testified that her reaction was based in part on her concern over the impact of the defendant's behavior on the children who were on the esplanade, she also testified that she experienced ""a little shock[]"" herself.  for this reason, there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to find that the commonwealth had proved the fifth element of the offense.2.  testimony and closing argument.  the defendant contends that it was error to allow n.m. to testify as to her observations of the children on the esplanade.  because the defendant did not object to this testimony, we review to determine if there was error, and if so, whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. renderos,, 425 (2003).  although ""[v]icarious concern for other people,"" without more, is not sufficient to demonstrate an individual's shock orpage 404alarm, see maguire, 476 mass. at 160, the commonwealth had the right to present n.m.'s account of the circumstances in which she made her observations.  ""[t]he prosecution with its burden of persuasion needs evidentiary depth to tell a continuous story.""  old chief v. united states, 519 u.s. 172, 190 (1997).  see commonwealth v. whitehead,, 657 (1980).  there was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.3.  jury instructions.  the defendant maintains that the judge omitted an instruction on an essential element of the crime, namely the ""objective component"" of open and gross lewdness, described for the first time in maguire, supra, as ""the focus of the fourth element.""  476 mass. at 159.in this case, the judge instructed the jury that the crime of open and gross lewdness consisted of five elements, as follows:""first, that the defendant exposed his genitals or buttocks to one or more persons; that the defendant did so intentionally; that -- third, that the defendant did so openly, that is, either he intended public exposure or he recklessly disregarded a substantial risk of public exposure to others who might be offended by such conduct; fourth, that the defendant's act was done in such a way as to produce alarm or shock and, fifth that one or more persons were -- were, in fact, alarmed or shocked.""following the decision in maguire, the district court model jury instruction was revised.  element four of the five-element instruction now reads as follows:  ""fourth:  that the defendant's act was done in such a way as would alarm or shock a reasonablepage 405person.""due to the defendant's failure to object to the jury instructions given at trial, our review is limited to determining whether any error in the instructions gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth  v. azar,, 685 (2002).  see also commonwealth v. johnston,, 704 (2014) (applying substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice standard where, although defendant failed to object to jury instructions, he was entitled to ""benefit of changes in decisional law . . . announced after trial and pending his direct review"").  in applying the substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice standard, ""[w]e consider the strength of the commonwealth's case, the nature of the error, the significance of the error in the context of the trial, and the possibility that the absence of an objection was the result of a reasonable tactical decision.""  azar, supra at 687.an initial question, therefore, is whether the pre-maguire model instruction effectively communicated to the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty, it was not sufficient for the commonwealth to prove that his conduct produced shock or alarm in the mind of n.m., but that, as the post-maguire model instruction states, the commonwealth also must prove that ""the defendant's act was done in such a way as would alarm or shock a reasonable person.""  instruction 7.400 of the model jury instructions for use in the district court (may, 2017), fourth element.  nowhere in the judge's instructions is there any reference to the distinction between the subjective and the objective components of the crime.  the jury were not informed that although the victim's experience of shock or alarm may satisfy the fifth element of the offense, the fourth element requires the jury to answer the independent question whether the victim's reaction was objectively reasonable.  finally, it should be noted that after the jury began their deliberations, they asked the court for ""a copy of the statute in question including the five conditions to be met.""  after consulting with counsel, the judge reinstructed the jury using the pre-maguire model instruction followed by an explanation of the intent element and a reference to the fourth and fifth elements that did not convey the distinction between the subjective and the objective components.  for these reasons, we conclude that the instructions in this case were deficient for failing to communicate to the jury that in order to convict the defendant ofpage 406open and gross lewdness they must find that the defendant's conduct produced shock or alarm in two independent respects, namely that n.m. experienced that reaction and that a reasonable person in her position also would have experienced shock or alarm.furthermore, the commonwealth's case was arguably weak as it related to the reasonableness of the victim's shock or alarm.  the evidence indicates that n.m., from her vantage point near a boat on a dock on the charles river located near the hatch shell, observed the defendant, from the side, as he walked along the esplanade wearing only a banana thong.  because his genitals were covered, the judge correctly instructed the jury that the only basis for finding that n.m. suffered shock or alarm at the appearance of the defendant, from the side, was the exposure of his buttocks.  even granting that n.m. was shocked or alarmed as a result of this experience, the jury were not asked and thus did not determine whether a reasonable person in n.m.'s position would have experienced shock or alarm based on the observation of the defendant's buttocks from n.m.'s distant vantage point.the defendant's failure to object to the jury instruction also cannot be characterized as a reasonable tactical decision.  the judge recited the district court model jury instruction to the jury, and no reported appellate decision prior to maguire put the defendant on notice that proof that some particular person experienced shock or alarm as a result of witnessing the defendant's intentional act of exposing his buttocks in public is a fact separate and independent from whether a reasonable person in the victim's position would experience shock or alarm.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. fitta,, 396 (1984) 

(conviction for open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior requires that ""defendant's act [is] committed in such a way as to produce alarm or shock"" [quotation omitted]).this, coupled with the commonwealth'spage 407arguably weak case as to the objective component of the open and gross lewdness statute, leads us to conclude that the defendant's failure to object to the jury instructions cannot be considered a reasonable tactical decision.under these circumstances, we conclude that there was a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. stoltz,, 644 (2009), quoting from commonwealth v. hall,, 730 (2000) (""[w]here 'error pertains to the definition given to the jury of the crime charged, the possibility of a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is inherent'"").  for this reason, the

1666,gail f. sullivan  vs.  robert m. lawlis & another.,"real property, partition.  land court, jurisdiction.  jurisdiction, land court.  partnership, what constitutes.  practice, civil, motion to dismiss.in the circumstances of a petition filed by the plaintiff in the land court to partition property in which she and the defendants held ownership interests, the judge erred in granting the defendants' motion to dismiss the petition for want of subject matter jurisdiction, where, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and drawing all inferences in her favor, genuine issues of material fact precluded a conclusion that the property was held by the parties in a partnership as a matter of law, such that dissolution of the partnership would be subject to the jurisdiction of the superior court rather than the land court. [412-416]","the parties to this action together own property located at 172-174 shrewsbury street in worcester (property).  the plaintiff, gail f. sullivan, holds her 2/9 interest as the result of a property division incident to her divorce from her former husband, who purchased the property with the defendant philip p. palmieri in 1986.  as the parties' relations deteriorated, sullivan filed a petition in the land court, seeking to partition the property.  in response, the defendants challenged the jurisdiction of the land court, claiming that the property is ineligible for partition because the relationship among the parties is in substance and actuality as partners in a partnership, and jurisdiction over dissolution of a partnership is in the superior court rather than the land court.  a judge of the land court agreed with the defendants, dismissing the plaintiff's petition for want of subject matterpage 410jurisdiction.  we conclude that the petition should not have been dismissed and remand the matter for further proceedings.background.  we summarize the evidence in the record before us.by deed dated february 5, 1986, louis c. dinatale and palmieri acquired title to the property.  dinatale and palmieri financed their purchase in part by a mortgage note made jointly and severally by them to guaranty bank and trust company, secured by a mortgage on the property.the deed did not specify whether the two men acquired their interests as joint tenants, tenants in common, or otherwise.  however, the two obtained a policy of title insurance from chicago title insurance company insuring their interests as tenants in common.  dinatale and palmieri subsequently conveyed a 5/9 interest in the property to the father of the defendant robert m. lawlis by deed dated june 9, 1995, and duly recorded.lawlis's father acquired his interest in the property as part of a ""like-kind exchange"" under the internal revenue code, 26 u.s.c. § 1031 (1994) (as in effect when lawlis, dinatale, and palmieri signed the like-kind agreement).  in the agreement for that conveyance, dinatale and palmieri represented that they were the owners of the property ""in fee simple and in common.""  sullivan acquired an undivided 2/9 interest in the property by deed dated january 13, 2006, and duly recorded, as the result of a property division incident to her divorce from dinatale.  the deed recites that it was supported by consideration of less than $100.  like the 1986 deed pursuant to which dinatale and palmieri first acquired their interests in the property, the 2006 deed to sullivan includes no statement describing or defining the nature of the estate conveyed.there is no written partnership agreement among the parties, nor is there a business name certificate filed in the name of a partnership.  however, the record reflects that the property is a commercial building, leased to commercial tenants.  rents frompage 411the building are deposited into one of various bank accounts in various names; the record includes conflicting information about whether all of the accounts are joint or whether palmieri is the sole authorized signatory on one or more of them.according to the judge's memorandum of decision, various leases of the property refer to the landlord in different ways, sometimes as ""palmieri, dinatale & lawliss"" [sic], sometimes as louis dinatale and philip palmieri, and other times as palmieri and the lawlis trust.palmieri manages the property, collecting rents, paying utilities and other expenses of the property, hiring contractors to maintain the property, and taking other actions as necessary to manage the property.  as funds are available in the bank account, palmieri makes periodic distributions to himself, lawlis, and sullivan, in proportion to their respective interests in the property.the question whether the parties have formed a partnership has arisen in prior court proceedings, if somewhat obliquely.  in a civil dispute brought in the worcester division of the district court department by lawlis, dinatale, and palmieri against a tenant of the property, the tenant moved to vacate an agreement for judgment signed only by palmieri on the ground that palmieri was without authority to bind the other two plaintiffs.  in that action, a district court judge denied the tenant's motion; the defendants assert that the order of denial signifies agreement with palmieri's argument that, as a partner, he was authorized to bind the others.for her part, sullivan has referred to ""the partnership"" in certain correspondence with palmieri and lawlis, and referred to herpage 412former husband and palmieri as ""partners"" in filings made in the probate and family court incident to her divorce from dinatale.  in his memorandum of decision, the motion judge observed that ""[n]o partnership tax returns or schedule k-1's have ever been filed.  the defendants contend that no such returns or schedules are required for a partnership with this few partners so long as the income and expenses are properly reflected on schedule e's, but have not cited any authority supporting that contention.""discussion.  partition is historically an equitable remedy rooted in common law that has since been reformed and modified by statute.  see o'brien v. mahoney, 179 mass. 200, 203 (1901).  it is a division between two or more persons of property, effected by the setting apart of their interests so that they can enjoy and possess the property in severalty, or by a sale of the whole and the awarding to each their share of the proceeds.  see g. l. c. 241, §§ 1, 4, 31; delta materials corp. v. bagdon,, 337-338 (1992).  properties owned in trust are not subject to partition, see rolland v. hamilton,, 60 (1943), nor are those held in partnership, see webber v. rosenberg,, 769 (1945).  for cotenants, however, partition is a matter of absolute right; it is not dependent on the consent of any of the cotenants or the discretion of the court.  see crocker v. cotting, 170 mass. 68, 70 (1898); o'brien v. mahoney, supra at 203-204.  in massachusetts, partition is governed by g. l. c. 241, and ""[a]ny person, except a tenant by the entirety, owning a present undivided legal estate in land"" may petition for the partition of such interest.  g. l. c. 241, § 1.  a petition for partitionpage 413may be filed either in the probate and family court or the land court.  g. l. c. 241, § 2.in the present case, the deed under which the parties acquired their title to the property did not specify how they would hold their title.  in the absence of language in a deed specifying otherwise, a conveyance of land to two or more persons creates ""an estate in common and not in joint tenancy.""  see g. l. c. 184, § 7.  however, the form of property ownership may be other than as provided under the deed itself, based on evidence of a contrary intent of the parties.  in particular, title to property acquired with partnership funds for partnership purposes is presumed to be partnership property, even though the deed conveys title in the names of one or more individuals.  see diranian v. diranian,, 609 (2002), citing g. l. c. 108a, § 8(2).  see also fall river whaling co. v. borden, 10 cush. 458, 461 (1852) (""[l]and, whatever the aspect of the legal title, may nevertheless be proved in equity to be part of the joint stock of a copartnership, and as such, liable to all the equitable conditions of partnership property"").  that partnership property may be held in the names of one or more of the partners, rather than in the name of the partnership, is expressly contemplated by g. l. c. 108a, § 10.""to determine whether or not a partnership exists, the legislature has enacted a set of rules that may be applied to the circumstances.  g. l. c. 108a, § 7.  in addition, other factors may be considered on the issue of the existence or nonexistence of a partnership.  see shain inv. co. v. cohen,, 9 (1982).  those factors include, among others, (1) an agreement by the parties manifesting their intention to associate in a partnership (2) a sharing by the parties of profits and losses, and (3) participation by the parties in the control or management of the enterprise.""  fenton v. bryan,, 690-691 (1992).notably, pursuant to g. l. c. 108a, § 7(2), ""[j]oint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property,page 414common property, or part ownership does not of itself establish a partnership, whether such co-owners do or do not share any profits made by the use of the property.""  the existence of a partnership is a question of the intent of the parties; whether a partnership arises ""depends upon their intent to associate as such,"" shain inv. co. v. cohen, supra at 7, and whether the parties acted in ways ""as would be normally expected of partners,"" boyer v. bowles,, 137 (1941).conflicting evidence concerning the existence of a partnership must be resolved by a finder of fact.  see fenton v. bryan, supra at 691.  cases in which the intent, motive, or state of mind of the parties is at the heart of the case are typically inappropriate for summary judgment.  see noyes v. quincy mut. fire ins. co.,, 726-727 (1979).  a person's intent is a question of fact ""to be determined from his declarations, conduct and motive, and all the attending circumstances.""  galotti v. united states trust co.,, 501 (1957), quoting from casey v. gallagher,, 749 (1951).  ""frequently, the pleadings, affidavits, and other submitted materials render necessary a further exploration of the significant facts and a decision onpage 415these 'state of mind' issues by a trier of fact who has heard and evaluated all relevant evidence.""  quincy mut. fire ins. co. v. abernathy,, 86 (1984).  however, even in a case where state of mind is an issue, it is incumbent on the party opposing summary judgment to file sufficient materials to raise a jury question in order to avoid entry of summary judgment.  see asian am. civic assn. v. chinese consol. benevolent assn. of new england, inc.,, 148 (1997) (language of deed and other documents, and statutory and common-law principles of conveyancing compelled conclusion that deed did not confer right to occupy space in building).the evidence in the record of the present case leaves us with considerable doubt whether the parties are in a partnership.  to be sure, there are numerous indicia consistent with the existence of a partnership, including the shared ownership and operation of the property and the sharing of profits therefrom.  however, the presence of such factors does not by itself establish the existence of a partnership.  see g. l. c. 108a, § 7(2), (3).  and there are a variety of indicia calling into question whether a partnership existed, including the manner in which the parties held themselves out to others, including tenants and taxing authorities, and the policy of title insurance palmieri and dinatale obtained when they first acquired the property, insuring their interests as tenants in common.  in particular, the like-kind exchange by which lawlis's father acquired his interest in the property is incompatible with a conclusion that the property was owned by a partnership rather than by palmieri and dinatale as cotenants; under the internal revenue code in effect at the time, partnership property was ineligible for a like-kind exchange.  see 26 u.s.c. § 1031(a)(2)(d) (1994).  viewing the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and drawing all inferences in her favor, see bulwer v. mount auburn hosp.,, 680 (2016), we conclude that genuine issues of material fact preclude a conclusion that the property is held by the parties in partnership as a matter of law.we also observe that there appear to be few advantages from the perspective of judicial economy in resolving the question on summary judgment.  as described in the introduction, the question whether the property is held in partnership or in common arose in the context of the question of the land court's jurisdiction over the plaintiff's petition.  but massachusetts courts have long discouraged dismissal in circumstances where the question of jurisdiction arises from distinctions among the various departmentspage 416of the trial court.  ""[w]hen a court of limited jurisdiction is confronted with a case over which its jurisdiction is doubtful or lacking, the court should not dismiss the case out of hand; rather, 'the proper procedure is for the judge to ask the [chief justice of the trial court] to transfer the case, or the judge, or both, to the appropriate department of the trial court.'""  arno v. commonwealth,, 446 (2010), quoting from konstantopoulos v. whately,, 129 (1981).in the present case, further proceedings will be required to resolve the parties' respective rights and remedies (whether in dissolution of a partnership if one exists, or partition of the property if it is held in common).  the parties also have asserted various claims over which the land court is without jurisdiction.it is likely that much of the evidence presented on the question of the existence or nonexistence of a partnership will overlap evidence presented on the parties' other claims.  we note as well that if the parties are found to hold title to the property as tenants in common rather than as partners, the superior court is without jurisdiction over the partition to which the plaintiff would then be entitled.  accordingly, we vacate the judgment and, consistent with the guidance furnished in konstantopoulos v. whately, supra, we remand this case to the land court with instructions to the judge to ask the chief justice of the trial court ""to transfer the case, or the judge, or both, to the appropriate department of the trial court,"" with authority in any event to adjudicate all claims of the parties, whether incident to partition of the property or dissolution of a partnership.so ordered.",civil,Keith C.

[420-424]","in this case, we address the timeliness of a notice of appeal from a final judgment that was corrected twice:  first, sua sponte to fix a clerical error in the calculation of prejudgment interest, and second, on a motion pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 60(a),  365 mass. 828  (1974), to correct an additional error in that same calculation.  because neither the sua sponte correction of a clerical error nor the filing (as here) of a rule 60(a) motion beyond ten days from entry of the original judgment has the effect of restarting the time for appeal from that judgment under mass.r.a.p. 4(a), as amended,  464 mass. 1601  (2013), we dismiss defendant paul f. flaherty, jr.'s appeal from the original judgment as untimely.background.  we briefly set forth the undisputed facts as agreed by the parties in their cross motions for summary judgment, leaving some procedural details for our discussion below.  this dispute stems from the failure of the defendants, as trustees of the patricia franchi flaherty 1999 revocable trust (trust), to pay plaintiff michael franchi (michael) on a promissory note (note) pursuant to which michael loaned $750,000 to his sister patricia franchi flaherty (patricia).under the terms of the note, michael and patricia agreed that michael's sole recourse for payment would be from patricia's ownership and beneficial interests in certain assets, which she had previously transferred to the trust.  patricia died before the initial payment became due, and the trust did not make payments to michael.  the present action, which michael and the other plaintiffs commenced in superior court,followed.after a period of discovery, michael moved for partial summary judgment on count 2 of the second amended complaint, asserting that the court should reach and apply trust assets topage 420satisfy a $750,000 debt owed to him by patricia.in their opposition, the defendants conceded liability under the note; they disputed only the amount due to michael and whether michael had complied with the notice provisions.the motion judge allowed michael's motion and ordered the trust to pay the principal balance of the note together with interest,remarking that the defendants did not appear to dispute that michael's claim was a direct contractual claim against the trust (as opposed to a claim against patricia's estate).  pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 54(b),  365 mass. 820  (1974), michael moved for entry of final judgment on his claim.  the unopposed motion was allowed.  the clerk of the superior court entered a final judgment on michael's claim on december 22, 2014 (original judgment).  defendant paul f. flaherty, jr., now appeals.discussion.  rule 4(a) of the massachusetts rules of appellate procedure requires an appellant in a civil case to file a notice of appeal ""within thirty days of the date of the entry of the judgment appealed from.""  mass.r.a.p. 4(a), first par.  here, the defendant purports to appeal from the original judgment, which entered aspage 421a final judgment on december 22, 2014.specifically, on january 11, 2017 -- more than 750 days after the original judgment entered, and nearly two years after the thirty-day deadline for appeal from the original judgment had lapsed on january 21, 2015 -- the defendant filed a notice of appeal from the original judgment.  accordingly, unless an exception applies, the defendant's appeal is not timely.rule 4(a) provides that certain postjudgment motions will alter the time period for the filing of a notice of appeal, such that the thirty-day period will not commence until the entry of the order disposing of the postjudgment motion.  relevant to the present case, rule 4(a) was amended in 2013 to provide as follows:""if a timely motion under the massachusetts rules of civil procedure is filed in the lower court by any party . . . to alter or amend a judgment under rule 59 or. . . the time for appeal for all parties shall run from the entry of the order . . . granting or denying any . . . such motion"" (emphasis added).mass.r.a.p. 4(a), second par.  a notice of appeal filed before the disposition of these postjudgment motions ""shall have no effect""; ""[a] new notice of appeal must be filed within the prescribed time measured from the entry of the order disposing of the [postjudgment] motion.""  ibid.1.  sua sponte correction of clerical error.  the defendant first maintains that the time for appeal was restarted when, on december 30, 2014, the court sua sponte corrected an arithmetic error in the original judgment regarding the amount of interest owed to michael.  the trial court has the power to correct clerical mistakes (such as arithmetic errors)pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 60(a), which provides:page 422""clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders.  during the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with leave of the appellate court.""the trial court's exercise of this power does not restart the appellate clock.  rule 4(a) of the rules of appellate procedure, second par., provides only that certain postjudgment motions restart the time to appeal; nothing in rule 4(a) suggests that the time for appeal is restarted based on the sua sponte action by the trial court.  to the contrary, it is well settled that where (as here) the trial court uses its inherent power to correct a clerical mistake such that the amended judgment does not alter the substantive rights affected by the original judgment, the time for appeal generally runs from the original judgment.see jones v. boykan,, 217 n.7 (2009) (""[t]he correction of a clerical error does not extend the time for taking an appeal from a final judgment""); farkas v. rumore, 101 f.3d 20, 22 (2d cir. 1996) (per curiam), citing federal trade commn. v. minneapolis-honeywell regulator co., 344 u.s. 206 (1952) (""where a judgment is reentered [based on a sua sponte correction of an administrative mistake by the trial court], and the subsequent judgment does not alter the substantive rights affected by the first judgment, the time for appeal runs from the first judgment"").accordingly, the sua sponte amendment of the original judgment did not alter the time to file the notice of appeal from the original judgment.2.  rule 60(a) motion to correct a clerical error.  the defendant next argues that the time for appeal was restarted when michael served on the defendants a motion pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 60(a) to correct an additional clerical error in the amended judgment.  specifically, on january 5, 2015 -- less than ten days afterpage 423entry of the amended judgment, but more than ten days after entry of the original judgment -- michael served a rule 60(a) motion to correct another clerical error in the calculation of prejudgment interest in the amended judgment.the defendant maintains that this motion, pursuant to rule 60(a), is one of the enumerated postjudgment motions that restart the time to file the notice of appeal.  in particular, the defendant contends that it was a motion ""to alter or amend a judgment under rule 59 or"" (emphasis added).  mass.r.a.p. 4(a), second par.  the defendant's argument overlooks that the rule 60(a) motion was not ""served within ten days after entry"" of the original judgment from which the defendant purports to appeal.  for this reason alone, the argument fails.nevertheless, the defendant maintains that the time for appeal was extended because michael's rule 60(a) motion was served within ten days of the entry of the amended judgment.  the flaw in the defendant's contention is that the defendant does not appeal from the clerical correction reflected in the amended judgment.  instead, he purports to challenge the merits of the allowance of michael's motion for summary judgment in the original judgment; the defendant's notice of appeal from that judgment was not filed until more than 750 days after the judgment entered.  michael's rule 60(a) motion (which was not served within ten days of the entry of the original judgment) does not ""produce a lazarus-like effect; it cannot resurrect [the defendant's] expired right to contest the merits of the underlying [original] judgment, nor bring the judgment itself before us for review.""  rodriguez-antuna v. chase manhattan bank corp., 871 f.2d 1, 2 (1st cir. 1989).  see 11 wright, miller, & kane, federal practice &page 424procedure § 2871, at 586 (3d ed. 2012) (timely appeal from correction of clerical error, after time for appeal of underlying judgment has run, ""would be limited to [the] disposition of the rule 60[a] motion and would not bring up for review the underlying judgment"").because the trial court's sua sponte correction in the amended judgment does not alter the finality of the original judgment or restart the time for appeal, and because michael's rule 60(a) motion was not served within ten days of the original judgment,the defendant's appeal from the original judgment is untimely.conclusion.  the appeal from the december 22, 2014, judgment, and from so much of the amended judgment entered december 28, 2016, as awarded damages in the sum of $750,000 is dismissed with prejudice.  in all other respects, the amended judgment is affirmed.so ordered.",civil,Kathe M.

administrative action.  department of environmental protection.this court concluded that, in the circumstances of a civil action seeking judicial review of an agency's adjudicatory decision under g. l. c. 30a, § 14, in which the superior court judge granted the plaintiff's motion for leave to present additional evidence (i.e., to reopen the agency hearing to take discovery) and ordered the case remanded under § 14(6), the order remanding the case, although interlocutory, was final as to the agency, and thus the agency's appeal was proper [429-431]; further, this court concluded that in such circumstances in which the agency had rejected the plaintiff's request to consider certain evidence, the judge erred in acting under § 14(6) to effectively overturn the agency's ruling, and such a remand could have been sought under § 14(7) and granted if warranted under the standards of review set forth therein [431-436]; finally, this court stated that even if the remand order under § 14(6) had been proper, the judge's declining to retain jurisdiction still would have been error [436].","this appeal presents the question whether a court conducting judicial review under g. l. c. 30a, §

426reviewed, along with the remainder of the agency's decision, under § 14(7).  here, a superior court judge issued such an order and corresponding judgment, and the agency appealed.  we conclude that the appeal is properly before us and that the judge erred in acting under § 14(6); the challenge to the agency's rulings should instead have been resolved under § 14(7).  we also conclude that instead of entering a judgment, the judge should have retained jurisdiction.  we therefore vacate the order and judgment and remand to the superior court for further proceedings.background.  the plaintiff commercial wharf east condominium association (cweca) is an association of owners of condominiums located at the landward end of boston's commercial wharf, but seaward of the historic low water mark, in an area constituting ""commonwealth tidelands"" under g. l. c. 91, § 1.  the defendant department of environmental protection (department) is charged with administering c. 91, the waterways act, which ""generally is viewed as an encapsulation of the commonwealth's public trust authority and obligations"" regarding tidelands.  arno v. commonwealth,, 454 (2010), quoting from fafard v. conservation commn. of barnstable,, 200 n.11 (2000).1.  determination of applicability.  in 2011, an abutting property owner filed with the department a ""request for a determination of applicability,"" seeking a ruling that a portion of cweca's property was being used for nonwater-dependent purposes (parking and vehicular access) and that such uses, not being authorized by statute, were impermissible unless cweca obtained a license under c. 91.  in 2012, the department's waterways regulation program issued a positive determination of applicability, concluding that the property at issue was subject to c. 91 and that its current nonwater-dependent uses were unauthorized.2.  administrative appeal.  a.  motion for summary decision.  cweca filed an administrative appeal of the determination andpage 427requested an adjudicatory hearing.  cweca filed a prehearing statement that listed no disputes of fact, but only legal issues, as requiring resolution.  cweca identified the issues as whether its current use of the area in question was authorized either by statute, by an existing c. 91 license, or by correspondence in the 1970s between one of cweca's predecessors in interest and the state department of public works (dpw), which had administered c. 91 until 1975.  see st. 1975, c. 706, §§ 123, 312.after a prehearing conference, the hearing officer determined that ""[t]he issues appear to be amenable to resolution by motion for summary decision.""in december, 2012, cweca filed such a motion, seeking to overturn the positive determination of applicability.  the department's waterways regulation program and the abutter opposed the motion, and the abutter asked that the positive determination be upheld.in 2013, the hearing officer issued a recommended decision concluding that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that as a matter of law the positive determination should be upheld.  see 310 code mass. regs. § 1.01(11)(f) (2004) (""summary decision, when appropriate, may be made against the moving party"").  of particular note, the hearing officer ruled that a 1964 statute relied upon by cwecahad not extinguished public trust rights in the commercial wharf area, as any legislation doing so must be explicit; that absent such legislation, the department's c. 91 licensing process provided the mechanism for protecting public trust rights in tidelands; and that correspondence of the type cited by cweca could not satisfy c. 91.b.  motion to reopen proceeding and take discovery.  while the recommended decision was awaiting final action by a deputy commissioner of the department (the commissioner having recused himself), cweca filed a ""motion to reopen proceeding and take discovery.""  the motion argued that the recommended decision had revealed disputes of fact as to whether the dpw had authorized the property uses in question ""through license orpage 428correspondence"" in the 1970s.  cweca sought to take discovery from the department and others to explore the existence of such documents.in november, 2014, the hearing officer denied cweca's motion, on three grounds.first, the hearing officer ruled that the motion was procedurally improper, because the recommended decision had ordered the parties not to move to reargue any part of that decision now that it was before the deputy commissioner for final action.second, although a department regulation allowed for a motion to reopen a hearing to submit ""new evidence,"" the hearing officer ruled that cweca had failed to show that ""the evidence to be introduced was not reasonably available for presentation at the hearing,"" 310 code mass. regs. § 1.01(14)(e) (2004), nor had cweca previously asserted that any material facts were in dispute.third, the hearing officer ruled that the evidence that cweca hoped to discover was legally immaterial.  to the extent that cweca hoped to discover a c. 91 license from the 1970s authorizing the disputed uses, not only had cweca failed to find any evidence of such a license in the department's publicly-accessible licensing files, but, by law, any c. 91 license not recorded by the licensee at the registry of deeds within a specified time after issuance (formerly one year, now sixty days) would be void.  see g. l. c. 91, § 18.  to the extent that cweca hoped to discover correspondence approving the disputed uses, the existence of such correspondence was ""purely speculative,"" and in any event such correspondence could not authorize a particular use of tidelands.  only an explicit statute or a c. 91 license could do so.c.  final department action.  at the same time as the hearing officer denied cweca's motion to reopen, the department's deputy commissioner adopted the recommended decision as the department's final decision.  cweca's motion for reconsideration was denied.3.  superior court proceedings.  cweca then filed in the superior court a complaint for judicial review, under g. l. c. 30a, § 14, of the department's decision.  after the department filed thepage 429record of administrative proceedings, see § 14(4), cweca filed what it styled a ""motion for leave to present additional evidence,"" seeking to reopen the department hearing to ""take discovery that was wrongfully denied cweca.""  as authority for the court to issue such an order, cweca cited g. l. c. 30a, § 14(6), which required it to show ""that the additional evidence is material to the issues in the case, and that there was good reason for failure to present it in the proceeding before the agency.""  see note 1, supra.over the department's opposition, the judge granted cweca's motion.  the judge ruled that a 1972 statute, when read together with the 1964 statute relied upon by cweca,""might"" have implicitly dispensed with the need for cweca's predecessor in interest to obtain a c. 91 license for the disputed uses.  the judge thus implicitly rejected -- on a basis that cweca had not argued to the department -- the final decision's conclusion that, because no statute explicitly authorized those disputed uses, c. 91 required cweca to obtain a license.the judge further ruled that evidence on implementation of the 1964 and 1972 statutes was ""material,"" and that the department's denial of cweca's request for discovery -- which the department had based in part on its conclusion that the materials cweca sought were not material -- constituted ""good reason"" for cweca's failure to present such evidence to the department.  the judge thus implicitly concluded that the department's reasons for denying cweca's request were not good reasons.  the judge did not mention any deference due to the department's view of the various statutes bearing on materiality or to the department's procedural rulings.  he ordered the case remanded to the department for cweca to conduct discovery.a judgment of remand then entered.  the department moved for reconsideration and to vacate the judgment, arguing that the remand order was erroneous and that, even if the judge declined to overturn it, he should in any event vacate the judgment and retain jurisdiction over the case, as § 14(6) assertedly required.  the judge denied the motion, and this appeal followed.discussion.  1.  appellate jurisdiction.  at the outset we consider and reject cweca's argument that the order remanding the case, being interlocutory in character, was not appealable by thepage 430department.  we conclude that although the order was interlocutory,the department's appeal ""fall[s] within the so called cliff house exception"" and is therefore proper.  wrentham v. west wrentham village, llc,, 515 (2008) (west wrentham village), citing cliff house nursing home, inc. v. rate setting commn.,(1979).""typically a judge's remand order to an agency is not subject to appeal.  however, the cliff house exception to this rule allows an 'administrative agency [to] appeal[] a [judge's] remand order that is final as to the agency.'  thus, where a remand order is final as to the agency to which the matter is remanded by a judge, the cliff house exception allows that agency to seek immediate appellate review because the agency 'cannot logically appeal from its own decision on remand.'""west wrentham village, 451 mass. at 515-516 (citations omitted).under cliff house, remand orders under § 14(7) have been held final as to, and thus appealable by, the agency, even though they did not compel a particular result on the merits,but merely required taking additional evidence, see j.c. hillary's v. massachusetts commn. against discrimination,, 206-207 & n.4 (1989), or related solely to what the reviewing superior court viewed as an agency procedural or evidentiary error.  see kelly v. civil serv. commn., 76 n.4 (1998) (remand to reconsider without reliance on erroneously admitted evidence); lincoln v. personnel adminstrator of the dept. of personnel admin.,, 210-211 (2000) (remand to follow different procedure); chief justice for admin. & mgmt. of the trial court v. massachusetts commn. against discrimination,page 431, 730 n.5, 734 (2003) (remand for additional findings).  these supreme judicial court decisions, all cited in west wrentham village, 451 mass. at 515, show that it is not a prerequisite to the application of cliff house that a remand order compel a particular result on the merits.here, the remand order was final as to the department, and thus immediately appealable, because it rejected two department rulings in a manner that the department might otherwise never be able to appeal.  the remand order effectively overruled the department's conclusions that cweca's discovery request was procedurally improper and sought information that was substantively immaterial.  had the department proceeded in accordance with the remand order, there was no assurance that the matter would ever have returned to the superior court or led to a judgment from which the department could appeal.  the only sure way for the department to obtain review of the remand order was to appeal from it directly, as cliff house permits.2.  propriety of action under § 14(6).  we now come to the question whether, when an agency has rejected a party's request to consider certain evidence, a judge acting under § 14(6) may allow the party's motion to remand to the agency to consider that same evidence, where doing so would effectively overturn the agency's ruling.  we hold that § 14(6) may not be used in this manner; instead, such a remand may be sought under § 14(7), and granted if warranted under the standards of review set forthpage 432therein.  section 14(6) is not an alternative means of obtaining review of an agency ruling or decision.  rather, it is a mechanism for supplementing the original agency record, in narrow circumstances, before the court completes its review of the agency's decision under § 14(7).section 14(7) authorizes the reviewing court to, among other things, ""remand the matter for further proceedings before the agency"" if a party's substantial rights have been prejudiced because the agency's decision either violates constitutional provisions, exceeds the agency's statutory authority or jurisdiction, is based upon an error of law or unlawful procedure, is unsupported by substantial evidence, or is arbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.  importantly,""[t]he court shall make the foregoing determinations upon consideration of the entire record, or such portions of the record as may be cited by the parties.  the court shall give due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.""g. l. c. 30a, § 14(7).  thus, where an agency denies a party's request to consider (or permit discovery to obtain) certain evidence, based on the agency's view that the request is procedurally improper or that the evidence is legally immaterial, that party remains free to challenge the agency ruling on any of the § 14(7) grounds just mentioned.here, for example, cweca's complaint for judicial review challenged the department's discovery ruling on multiple grounds, including that it violated cweca's procedural rights, and was premised on legal errors in the department's interpretation of the c. 91 scheme it is charged with enforcing and of other statutes relevant to the public trust in tidelands.  cweca's § 14(6) motion added a claim that the discovery ruling was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.  as cweca's own motion conceded, all of these claims were reviewable under § 14(7).but the two subsections are not interchangeable alternatives.  section 14(6) is, in a sense, a narrow exception to the rule that ""an issue not raised before the [agency] is deemed waived"" on judicial review under § 14(7).  vaspourakan, ltd. v. alcoholic bevs. control commn.,, 354 (1987).  if the party challenging the agency decision has failed to present material evidencepage 433to the agency, but can show ""good reason"" for that failure, then § 14(6) allows a remand so that the agency can take the additional evidence, and supplement its findings or decision if necessary, before the court undertakes its review of the final agency decision.  if, on the other hand, the party has attempted to present the evidence, but was prevented from doing so by an agency ruling, the party's remedy is not to seek a remand under § 14(6), but to challenge the agency ruling under § 14(7).importantly, § 14(7) relief may be granted only after review of ""the entire record"" (or those portions cited by the parties), and only after giving ""due weight to the experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge of the agency, as well as to the discretionary authority conferred upon it.""  such judicial deference is required -- but apparently was not afforded -- in each of the three areas implicated by the department's ruling here.first, where (as here) the agency's challenged evidentiary ruling is based on its interpretation of the statutes it administers, the reviewing court must be mindful that ""[w]hile the 'duty of statutory interpretation is for the courts . . . an administrative agency's interpretation of a statute within its charge is accorded weight and deference. . . .  where the [agency's] statutory interpretation is reasonable . . . the court should not supplant [its] judgment' (citations omitted)."" peterborough oil co. v. department of envtl. protection,, 449 (2016), quoting from dowling v. registrar of motor vehicles,, 525 (1997).second, ""regulation of the administrative discovery process lies within the sound exercise of the hearing officer's discretion, just as regulation of the discovery process in judicial proceedings lies within the sound exercise of judicial discretion.""  augis corp. v. massachusetts commn. against discrimination,, 404405 (2009). third, where (as here) the evidentiary or discovery ruling is bound up with matters of agency procedure, ""agencies have broad discretion over procedural matters before them.""  zachs v. department of pub. util.,, 227 (1989).  a reviewing court should ""defer to an agency's procedural rulings,"" reviewing them only for error of law or abuse of discretion, ""page 434"" (emphasis added).  brockton power co. v. energy facilities siting bd.,, 219 (2014).a party challenging an agency evidentiary or discovery ruling cannot evade these deferential § 14(7) standards of review, and thereby disrupt the proper balance of authority between agencies and courts, by bringing its challenge under § 14(6).  it is true that § 14(6) requires a showing ""to the satisfaction of the court"" that the proposed additional evidence is material and that there was good reason for the failure to present it to the agency, and that § 14(6) allows the court, if satisfied, to order the additional evidence taken before the agency ""upon such conditions as the court deems proper.""  but this does not imply that a party may elect, by proceeding under § 14(6) rather than § 14(7), to have the agency's ruling reviewed solely for whether it comports with the court's own views on the agency's governing statutes and internal procedures.  to the contrary, it implies that § 14(6) is addressed only to those situations where, for ""good reason,"" the agency has not already been presented with and ruled upon the evidentiary question.  where there is no relevant agency ruling for the court to review under deferential § 14(7) standards, the court's own views necessarily assume heightened importance.moreover, where the agency has already ruled on the evidentiary issue, it would make little sense to permit the challenging party to use § 14(6) to bifurcate the judicial review process, by bringing claims of erroneous exclusion of evidence through a motion under § 14(6), while challenging the agency's other claimed errors through the well-established process for judicial review under § 14(7).  see superior court standing order 1-96.  all claims of agency error should be reviewed together, based ""upon consideration of the entire record"" or the portions cited by the parties.g. l. c. 30a, § 14(7).  such plenary consideration tends to maintain the required focus both on the substantivepage 435review standards of § 14(7) and on whether ""the substantial rights of any party may have been prejudiced"" by any agency error that occurred.  ibid.  piecemeal review, examining some issues under § 14(6) and others under § 14(7), would lead to an inefficient use of judicial and agency resources, as well as delay and disruption.established standards of appellate review support this conclusion.  an appellate court reviewing a superior court's ruling under § 14(7) ""is conducting an analysis of the same agency record, and there is no reason why the view of the superior court should be given any special weight. both in the superior court and in [the appellate] court the scope of review is defined by g. l. c. 30a, § 14.""  southern worcester county. regional vocational sch. dist. v. labor relations commn.,, 903 (1979) (citations omitted).  see heineken u.s.a., inc. v. alcoholic bevs. control commn.,, 568 n.3 (2004).  a judge's action under § 14(6), in contrast, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  massachusetts assn. of minority law enforcement officers v. abban,, 266 (2001); commonwealth v. roxbury charter high pub. sch.,, 53 (2007).  it would make little sense for a judge's decision either upholding or rejecting a party's challenge to an agency evidentiary ruling to be subject to differing standards of appellate review depending on whether the judge had ruled under § 14(6) or § 14(7).  again, the more logical conclusion is that § 14(6) simply does not authorize such challenges.thus we think it no coincidence that, in all but one of the reported decisions concerning motions under § 14(6), there is no indication that the agency had already ruled on whether to accept the additional evidence proffered to the reviewing court.evenpage 436the single exception we have identifiedtends to support our conclusion:  a challenge to such an agency ruling should be made and resolved under § 14(7).3.  retention of jurisdiction under § 14(6).  finally, even if the remand order under § 14(6) had been proper, the judge's declining to retain jurisdiction would still be error.  ""the procedure for remand delineated in [§ 14(6)] apparently contemplates the retention of jurisdiction.""  white v. director of the div. of employment security,, 639 n.4 (1985).  the text of § 14(6) leaves little room for any other view.superior court standing order 1-96, third par., issued to facilitate the orderly resolution of claims for judicial review under § 14 and similar statutes, has long provided that if the court allows a § 14(6) motion, ""all further proceedings shall be stayed until the administrative agency has complied with the provisions of [§ 14(6)].""  a court ordering a § 14(6) remand should, rather than entering a judgment,retain jurisdiction and stay its proceedings during the remand.conclusion.  it was error to rely on § 14(6) to overturn the department's evidentiary and procedural rulings and remand to the department for the taking of further evidence.  such relief was available, if at all, only under § 14(7).   accordingly, the order andpage 437judgment under § 14(6) are vacated, and the case is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings.so ordered.",civil,None,affirm

[443-444]at the trial of a criminal complaint charging the defendant with intimidation of a witness, the judge properly denied the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty, made at the close of the commonwealth's case, where, at that time, a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant authored certain threatening text messages; further, the judge did not err in denying the defendant's motion for a required finding, made at the close of all evidence, where the commonwealth's case had not deteriorated after it closed its case. [444-446]","following a jury trial in the district court, the defendant, matthew g. alden, jr., was convicted of intimidating a witness by sending her threatening text messages in violation of g. l. c. 268, § 13b.  on appeal, the defendant claims (1) evidence regarding the text messages was improperly admitted, (2) the judge incorrectly instructed the jury regarding the commonwealth's burden of proof, and (3) the evidence was not sufficient to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  we affirm.background.  we summarize the facts the jury could have found, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth.  see commonwealth v. latimore,, 676-677 (1979).  the victim in the case, e.b., was the defendant's former girl friend.  at the time of trial, she had known the defendant for at least five years.  in january, 2015, there was a criminal case pending against the defendant, in which e.b. was a potential witness.  on january 19, 2015, e.b. reported to the police that she was receiving threatening text messages from someone she believed to be the defendant.  the messages were received from the telephone number e.b. had used to communicate with the defendant by text messages and telephone calls every few days for over one year.the messages threatened that, if e.b. ""went to court[, she would] be sorry[,] and that [the defendant] would have people come after [her] if [she] went to court.""  more specifically, ""[o]ne of [the messages] told [e.b.] to keep her hoe ass mouth shut.  [another] implied that she should kill herself and she should do it tonight.""  an additional text message stated that e.b. should ""leave their personal stuff out of the courtroom and that if she opened her mouth it'd be the worst thing she tried to do -- . . . or the biggest mistake she ever made.""  e.b. believed the text messages referred to her role as a witness in the criminal case then pending against the defendant.the defendant testified that at the time the threatening messages were received by e.b., he and his new girl friend had been living with his aunt for ""[a] couple of months.""  the defendant and his mother testified that the cellular telephone (cell phone) associated with the number from which the threatening messagespage 440were received was not owned by the defendant.  according to the defendant, his aunt had purchased the cell phone, but it was shared with the defendant and at least six other people who lived at his aunt's residence.the cell phone was not password protected and remained at the aunt's house for use by its residents.  the defendant denied sending the threatening text messages to e.b.  he testified that, at the time the text messages were sent, he was at the mall and did not have the cell phone with him.  finally, the defendant testified that his new girl friend did not like e.b.discussion.  1.  evidentiary issues.  a.  authentication of text messages.  ""[b]efore admitting an electronic communication in evidence, a judge must determine whether sufficient evidence exists 'for a reasonable jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant authored' the communication.""  commonwealth v. oppenheim,, 366 (2014), quoting from commonwealth v. purdy,, 447 (2011).  ""[i]rrespective of whether the communication is introduced through testimony or a physical item of evidence,"" proponents seeking to introduce such electronic communications into evidence must first establish authenticity.  commonwealth v. connolly,, 587 (2017).here, the defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence of the text messages because they were not ""properly authenticated"" -- that is, because the evidence was not sufficient to authenticate them as having been authored by him.  the judge deferred ruling until trial, but ultimately concluded that the commonwealth had established by a preponderance of the evidence that the text messages were authentic.  we discern no error in that decision.""a judge making a determination concerning the authenticity of a communication sought to be introduced in evidence may look to 'confirming circumstances' that would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that this evidence is what its proponent claims it to be.""  purdy, supra at 448-449, citing commonwealth v. hartford,, 488 (1963).  here, there was evidence that, for over one year, e.b. had contacted the defendant multiple times each week using the telephone number from which the threatening messages originated.  when she called that number, the defendant answered.  when she sent a text message to thatpage 441number to arrange a meeting with the defendant, he appeared.  from this pattern of conduct, the judge could reasonably infer a direct connection between the defendant and the telephone number from which the threatening messages were sent.  see commonwealth v. amaral,, 672 (2011) (""fatal to the defendant were the actions he took in conformity with the information contained in [the messages]""). the content of the text messages reinforced their link to the defendant.  it is undisputed that at the time she received the text messages, e.b. was a witness in a pending case against the defendant.  in this context, where there was evidence that the text messages directed her to ""keep her hoe ass mouth shut"" and ""leave their personal stuff out of the courtroom"" or ""people [would] come after [her] if [she] went to court,"" it was reasonable to infer that the defendant was responsible for sending the messages.the defendant's reliance on commonwealth v. williams,(2010), and commonwealth v. salyer,(2013), is misplaced.  in those cases, electronic communications sent on the social networking web site myspace were not properly authenticated.  in salyer, the commonwealth failed to introduce admissible evidence establishing any connection between the offending pages and message on myspace and the defendant.  salyer, supra at 355-356.  in williams, where the messages were alleged to have been sent by the defendant's brother, the supreme judicial court emphasized that there was no evidence regarding any limitation on access to a myspace account, and no circumstances beyond the messages' content that linked them to the defendant's brother.  williams, supra at 868-869.  the supreme judicial court explained that ""[a]nalogizing a my[s]pace web page to a telephone call, a witness's testimony that he or she has received an incoming call from a person claiming to be 'a,' without more, is insufficient evidence to admit the call as a conversation with 'a.'""  id. at 869.  here, by contrast, there was more.  in addition to the content of the text messages, e.b.'s prior relationship with the defendant and her use of the telephone number to communicate with him over a significant period of time provided the necessary link.  simply put, these confirming circumstances sufficiently connected the defendant to the threats.  see purdy, 459 mass. at 450-451.b.  best evidence rule.  the defendant claims that the best evidence rule precluded testimony regarding the content of the text messages.  because the defendant never raised this argumentpage 442at trial, we review any error for a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. leary,, 336 (2017).  ""the best evidence rule provides that, where the contents of a document are to be proved, the party must either produce the original or show a sufficient excuse for its nonproduction.""  commonwealth v. ocasio,, 6 (2001).  there is an exception, however, regarding statements of parties.  ""the proponent may prove the content of a written statement of the party against whom the evidence is offered without producing or accounting for the original.""  mass. g. evid. § 1007 (2018).  here, once the judge made a preliminary determination that the evidence was sufficient to authenticate that the text messages were sent by the defendant, this exception applied.  accordingly, the best evidence rule did not.  there was no error, much less a substantial risk that justice miscarried.c.  cross-examination of the defendant.  at the close of cross-examination of the defendant, the prosecutor posed to the defendant a series of ten questions, each asking whether the defendant had sent a particular text message.  each question incorporated the exact language of the text message.in each instance, the defendant denied sending the text message.  on appeal, the defendant claims that this line of cross-examination improperly relied on facts not in evidence.  we are not persuaded.generally, ""[a] prosecutor may not conduct cross-examination 'in bad faith or without foundation.'""  commonwealth v. christian,, 561 (2000), quoting from commonwealth v. white,, 285 (1975).  here, although some of the questions included text messages not previously described by e.b., the commonwealth had a ""reasonable belief that the facts implied by the questions could be established by admissible evidence.""  commonwealth v. peck,, 39 (2014).  the jury had already heard the general nature of the threatening text messages through the testimony of e.b. and a police witness.  moreover, ""screen shot[s]"" of the text messages had been preserved and made available to the defendant.  although the screen shots themselves were never offered in evidence, the prosecutor was aware, prior to the defendant's testimony, that the judge had found ""by a preponderance of the evidence that those text messages are authentic, even though theypage 443weren't presented in the form of photographs or business records.""  therefore, the prosecutor had a good faith belief that the threats implied by the questions could be established by admissible evidence.  accordingly, the judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the cross-examination.  see commonwealth v. durand,, 662 (2016).2.  instruction.  in addition to the general instruction that the commonwealth had the burden of proving each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge gave a supplemental instruction that, before they could consider the content of the text messages, the jury must be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the messages had been sent by the defendant.the defendant claims that the supplemental instruction was reversible error because it confused the jury regarding the commonwealth's burden of proof.  we disagree.""we review objections to jury instructions to determine if there was any error, and, if so, whether the error affected the substantial rights of the objecting party.""  beverly v. bass river golf mgmt.,, 603 (2018) (quotation omitted).  because the commonwealth sought to introduce evidence of the contents of text messages, an instruction on a preliminary determination of authorship was appropriate, and the instruction given was an accurate statement of the law.  see purdy, 459 mass. at 447-450; oppenheim, 86 mass. app. ct. at 363-369.  the judge also properly instructed the jury on the elements of the crime, including that the commonwealth had the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the defendant who directly or indirectlypage 444threatened the victim.three times the judge emphasized that the commonwealth's burden was to prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""trial judges have 'considerable discretion in framing jury instructions, both in determining the precise phraseology used and the appropriate degree of elaboration.'""  commonwealth v. kelly,, 688 (2015) (quotation omitted).  we acknowledge that in this case there was a fine line between the (1) preliminary determination of the authenticity of the text messages and (2) proof of the defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the threats.  nevertheless, authenticity and identity are different legal concepts, and the judge did not err in explaining the distinction.  while, in the context of this case, it would have been preferable to instruct the jury more directly that authorship of the threatening text messages was an element of the offense that had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge acted within his discretion in framing the instructions as he did.  moreover, the judge gave a curative instruction after the defendant objected.considering these instructions as a whole, see commonwealth v. allen,, 168 (2016), we are confident that the defendant's substantive rights were not adversely affected by the supplemental jury instruction.3.  sufficiency.  ""where, as here, a defendant moves for required findings at the close of the commonwealth's case and at the close of all the evidence, '[w]e [first] consider the state of the evidence at the close of the commonwealth's case to determine whether the defendant's motion should have been granted at that time,'"" commonwealth v. morgan,, 349 (2007), quoting from commonwealth v. sheline,, 283 (1984), that is, ""whether the commonwealth [had] presented sufficient evidence of the defendant's guilt to submit the case to the jury,"" commonwealth v. dustin,, 1003 (2016) (quotation omitted).  the evidence is sufficient if, ""viewing the evidencepage 445in a light most favorable to the commonwealth, 'rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt' (emphasis original).""  commonwealth v. cohen (no. 1),, 120 (2010), quoting from latimore, 378 mass. at 677.to establish a violation of g. l. c. 268, § 13b, ""the commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant wilfully engaged in intimidating conduct, that is, acts or words that would instill fear in a reasonable person, and did so with the intent to impede or influence a potential witness's testimony"" against the defendant.  commonwealth v. rivera,, 535 (2010).  the defendant does not dispute the threatening nature of the messages or that they were intended to impede or influence e.b., a potential witness in a criminal case pending against him.  as to the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant's only claim is that no rational juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he authored the text messages.  we disagree.we have previously discussed the circumstantial evidence linking the defendant to the threatening messages.  first, the jury heard that there had been a long-standing pattern of communication between the defendant and e.b. using the telephone number from which the threats originated.  second, the jury could rationally conclude that the threats to ""leave their personal stuff out of the courtroom"" or ""people [would] come after [her] if [she] went to court"" were intended by the defendant to intimidate e.b., so that she would not testify in the case then pending against him.  viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, this evidence was sufficient to prove the defendant's identity beyond a reasonable doubt.""we also consider the state of the evidence at the close of all the evidence, to determine whether the commonwealth's position as to proof deteriorated after it closed its case.""  sheline, supra.  however, ""[d]eterioration does not occur merely because the defendant contradicted the commonwealth's evidence . . . 'unless the contrary evidence is so overwhelming that no rational jury could conclude that the defendant was guilty.'""  commonwealth v. ross,, 381 (2017) (citation omitted).  we do not view the uncorroborated testimony of the defendant and his mother as overwhelming contrary evidence.  ""as the jury were free to disbelieve the defendant's account, there was nothing compelling in this evidence which caused the prosecution's case to deteriorate.""  commonwealth v. walker,, 343-page 446344 (1987).  accordingly, we discern no error in the judge's denial of either of the defendant's motions for a required finding of not guilty.judgment affirmed.",criminal,Michael L.

[451-455]a juvenile court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the mother's motion for a new trial following a proceeding to dispense with her parental rights regarding an adoption, where there was no merit to the mother's claim that her several appointed counsel were ineffective for declining to pursue requests regarding a paternity action in which they did not represent the mother or that better work would have yielded material results on the mother's claims regarding the father's fitness; where the record supported the judge's findings, by clear and convincing evidence, that the mother was unfit due to unaddressed mental health and alcohol abuse issues and that termination of her parental rights was in the best interest of the child; and where there was no merit to the mother's claim that the trial had been infected with structural error.

petition.  following a trial in the juvenile court, the judge found the mother to be unfit and terminated her parental rights.  the mother appeals, claiming that she was denied due process when she

of alcohol when she struck a woman and her seven year old child; the woman was seriously injured, and the child was killed.  the mother was held without bail on criminal charges arising out of the incident.as no one could be located to take immediate custody of raissa, the department filed a petition for care and protection in the juvenile court.  ultimately, raissa was placed with her father, who obtained permanent custody, and the mother's parental rights were terminated.the mother remained in custody on the criminal matter during the pendency of the juvenile court proceedings.in november, 2013, the judge appointed an attorney to represent the mother.  in march of 2014, that attorney moved to withdraw at the request of the mother and indicated that an irretrievablepage 449breakdown in communication had occurred.  the mother requested that another attorney be appointed to represent her.  over the course of the following year, three additional attorneys were successively appointed to represent the mother.  she effectively discharged each of them by requesting each to withdraw from her case.in february, 2015, the judge appointed a fifth attorney to represent the mother.  at a may, 2015, pretrial hearing, the mother refused to enter the court room.  in july, 2015, within weeks of the scheduled trial, the fifth attorney moved to withdraw at the direction of the mother.  at a hearing on july 1, 2015, the mother initially refused to enter the court room.  the attorney cited the mother's refusal to attend court proceedings and her insistence on speaking in spanish, rather than in english (although they had always communicated in english in the past without any difficulty), as additional grounds for withdrawal.  the mother was eventually persuaded to come into the court room on that day,and the judge asked her about her ability to communicate in english.  speaking in english, the mother stated that her first language was spanish; however, she agreed that she could speak and understand english well.  the judge then advised the mother that he was going to appoint a sixth attorney for her, that she had to communicate in english with the new attorney, and that he was going to schedule a new trial date that would give the new attorney sufficient time to prepare.at the same hearing, the judge heard the mother's complaints about her attorneys.  the mother complained that her current attorney would not provide her with copies of certain documents.  the judge explained that issues of confidentiality prevented the attorney from doing so.  he told the mother that he would not continue the case again and that, if she could not cooperate with the new attorney, she would have to represent herself at trial.  hepage 450discouraged self-representation in favor of reliance on competent counsel with expertise in the field.  he emphasized the important stakes involved, namely the ability of the mother to have custody of her child, and the importance of finality, particularly for raissa.on september 30, 2015, the mother's sixth attorney moved to withdraw, citing an irretrievable breakdown in communications with his client.  the attorney indicated that the mother had written a letter instructing him to withdraw and then had refused to meet with him when he attempted to visit with her to discuss the matter.  the judge allowed the attorney to withdraw.  he also ordered a court clinic evaluation (evaluation) of the mother's competency to represent herself, in the event that she intended to do so.  in the event that the mother was still seeking successor counsel or at least standby counsel, the judge appointed a seventh attorney to represent the mother.the trial was rescheduled for january 21, 2016.  a month before the trial date, however, the seventh attorney also moved to withdraw, indicating that the mother had discharged him.on january 21, 2016, the mother appeared for the court hearing, representing herself (with her seventh attorney present as standby counsel) and speaking through a spanish language interpreter.  the mother complained that the seventh attorney had not worked on the case as she had requested.  she asked the judge to appoint another attorney, to give her the assistance of a spanish language interpreter, and to allow her to complete the evaluation.  the judge arranged for the evaluation,continued the trial, and appointed an eighth attorney to represent the mother, emphasizing that the trial must take place on the next scheduled date.on march 30, 2016, the next scheduled trial date, the eighth attorney moved to withdraw at the mother's request.  the attorney cited an irretrievable breakdown in communication as well aspage 451ethical issues with continued representation.  the judge allowed the attorney to withdraw.the judge then considered the mother's request for a spanish language interpreter.  after finding that the mother did not need the services of an interpreter due to her exhibited proficiency in english, both in her communications with the judge and her attorneys, the judge then excused the interpreter, who had been present in the court room.  the judge asked the mother whether there was any reason that the trial should not go forward as planned.  after the mother failed to answer the judge's repeated questions, he noted that the mother was ""sitting there and is not responding in any way.""  finding that the mother had engaged in dilatory tactics to delay trial, the judge ordered the trial to proceed.  he appointed a new attorney to act as standby counsel to assist the mother in representing herself at trial.  after a recess called to allow the mother to confer, standby counsel reported that the mother spoke only in spanish, and that they could not communicate.trial commenced.  the first witness was the family preservation program director at the massachusetts correctional institution in framingham (mci-framingham), where the mother was being held.  she testified that her conversations with the mother had been in english and that she had observed the mother communicating with other mci-framingham staff members in english.  the department called additional witnesses and submitted documents in evidence.  when given the opportunity to cross-examine each witness, the mother spoke only in spanish.  after the department rested, the judge asked the mother whether she wanted to testify or present witnesses, but she responded only in spanish.  the mother did submit documents with the assistance of standby counsel.  the trial concluded and the judge later issued a notice of decision determining that the mother was unfit and terminating her parental rights.  the father was determined to be fit, and permanent custody of raissa was awarded to him.discussion.  1.  waiver of right to counsel.""an indigent parent in a g. l. c. 210, § 3, proceeding has a constitutional right

commonwealth v. means,, 89-92 (2009).  see also commonwealth v. babb,, 735 (1994) (defendant's refusal to proceed with appointed counsel without good cause constitutes abandonment).waiver by conduct

""the acts leading to waiver by conduct need not be violent, but they must be highly disruptive of orderly or safe proceedings.""  means, 454 mass. at 91.  repeated changes in counsel delay proceedings because of the need for each new attorney to become familiar with the client and the case; consequently, they interfere with orderly proceedings.  see appleby, 389 mass. at 366-368 (motion for new counsel employed as delay tactic); commonwealth v. clemens,, 237 (2010) (""most common problem accompanying a request for a change of counsel is the need for a continuance of the trial"").when faced with this situation, it is within the trial judge's broad discretion to take reasonable measures to keep the proceedings moving forward, even if the result is to leave the defendant, or in this case the parent, without counsel.  when taking such action, ""[t]he judge must weigh the constitutional protections of a [parent] against the interest of orderly trial administration.""  commonwealth v. kenney,, 150 (2002).  see commonwealth v. pena,, 192-195 (2012) (judge did not violate probationer's right to counsel when he required him to proceed pro se with standby counsel in interest of judicial efficiency, where probationer ""refused"" services of succession of court-appointed counsel and probationer thereafter was ""purposefully . . . trying to delay"" proceedings).in cases involving the termination or curtailment of a parent's rights, there is an additional, competing consideration, beyond the mother's right to counsel -- the rights of the child.

[461-463]this court concluded that an irrevocable spendthrift trust established on behalf of a disabled husband upon divorce from his wife under the terms of a separation agreement incorporated in the judgment of divorce nisi was self-settled, where the legal and equitable rights of the beneficiary husband in the settlement of his and the wife's rights and obligations upon dissolution of the marriage was the impetus behind the creation of the trust, and thus he was properly considered to be the settlor [463-466]; further, this court concluded that despite the intentions of the husband and wife as parties to the separation agreement to have created a valid spendthrift trust that would protect the trust's assets from the husband's creditors, they could not except the trust from g. l. c. 203e, § 505(a)(2), with regard to a creditor's effort to reach the trust to satisfy any judgment against the husband [466-467]; nor did any statute or common-law principle confer a special status on the husband, considering his cognitive impairments that caused him to be placed under guardianship, in terms of self-settled spendthrift trusts that are approved by a judge in the course of approving a separation agreement.

stone worked as an artist and then as a mental health counselor, making a modest salary.  during the marriage, the family was supported primarily, if not exclusively,page 460by stone's income from her employment and her assets.mcinerney, by his guardian, and stone executed a separation agreement, which was incorporated into the judgment of divorce nisi.  the separation agreement was later amended by stipulation and approved by a judge of the probate and family court.  the amended separation agreement (asa), dated january 26, 2007, settled mcinerney's and stone's rights and obligations to one another upon dissolution of their marriage.in pertinent part, the asa provided that stone would transfer approximately thirty-five percent of the funds in her keybank accounts to a spendthrift trust to be created for mcinerney.in addition, the asa contained provisions regarding the marital home, a vacation home in maine, the purchase of a home in plymouth for mcinerney, and other assets, including assets inherited by stone.  the asa provided that the division of assets would survive entry of the judgment of divorce nisi and would have independent legal significance.  by approving the asa and incorporating it into the judgment of divorce nisi, the probate and family court judge found that the terms were fair and reasonable.b.  creation of the brian k. mcinerney irrevocable trust.  the brian k. mcinerney irrevocable trust (trust) was created on march 23, 2007, and, though irrevocable, the trustees were given complete discretion to distribute as much of the income andpage 461principal of the assets in the trust as they felt were necessary to meet the reasonable needs of mcinerney.  the terms of the trust identified stone as the settlor, mcinerney as the beneficiary, and their children, elise and dru, as the remainder beneficiaries.  the trustees at that time were mcinerney's sister and guardian (jean e. mcinerney),and bank of america as the corporate trustee.  the trust provides that the ""interest of any beneficiary created herein, either as to income or principal, shall not be alienated, anticipated or in any other manner assigned by such beneficiary and shall not be subject to legal process, bankruptcy proceedings, or the interference or control of creditors.""pursuant to the asa, on may 7, 2007, stone transferred $3,538,402.34 of stocks and bonds to the trust.  she also transferred the plymouth home valued at $538,400 into the trust.  in addition, mcinerney transferred assets standing in his own name, totaling more than $120,000, into the trust.c.  the motor vehicle accident at issue.  on april 30, 2014, plaintiffs shonna calhoun and her minor child, timothy pink, jr., were involved in a motor vehicle accident with mcinerney.  it is alleged that mcinerney was traveling seventy-six miles per hour in a thirty-five miles per hour zone, crossed the yellow line to pass a vehicle, and collided head on with a vehicle being driven by calhoun.  the crash caused serious injuries to calhoun and her minor child, and mcinerney died from his injuries.the plaintiffscommenced this action in superior court seeking damages for mcinerney's negligence and a judgment declaring that the assets of the trust are available to them to satisfy any damages award.  the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment solely on the issue whether the trust's assets are available to the plaintiffs.  a judge (motion judge) determined that only the assets that mcinerney contributed to the trust are reachable.  the motion judge found that the assets contributed by stone are not reachable because stone was the sole owner of the assets until they entered the trust and mcinerney never had any prior legal or equitable interest in them.  a separate and final judgment entered on the declaratory judgment claim.  see mass.r.civ.p. 54(b),  365 mass. 820  (1974).  the plaintiffs appeal.2. discussion. a.  spendthrift trusts.  when faced with the question whether creditors may reach the assets of spendthrift trusts, ourpage 462cases distinguish between spendthrift trusts that are created by third parties, such as parents, and spendthrift trusts that are self-settled by an individual who is both settlor and beneficiary.  it has long been the law in this commonwealth that a trust created by a third-party settlor may protect a beneficiary's interest in the trust from creditors through spendthrift provisions.  see broadway natl. bank v. adams,, 173-174 (1882); pacific natl. bank v. windram, 133 mass. 175, 176 (1882).  even in the face of public policy arguments favoring access, a third-party settlor's intent to deny creditors of a beneficiary recovery against trust assets has been enforced.  pemberton v. pemberton,, 20 (1980).  the theory behind the enforcement of these spendthrift trusts is that the settlor of a trust is the absolute owner of his property and, in giving a gift, has ""the entire right to dispose of it, either by an absolute gift . . . or by a gift with such restrictions or limitations, not repugnant to law, as he [sees] fit to impose.""  adams, supra at 173.self-settled trusts, where the beneficiary is also the settlor, however, cannot be used to protect one's assets from creditors.  ""the established policy of this commonwealth long has been that a settlor cannot place property in trust for his own benefit and keep it beyond the reach of creditors.""  ware v. gulda,, 70 (1954), quoting from merchants natl. bank v. morrissey,, 605 (1953).  ""to permit a man . . . to attach to a valuable interest in property retained by himself the quality of inalienability and of exemption from his debts, seems to us to be going further than a sound public policy will justify.""  windram, 133 mass. at 176-177.  thus, ""[w]hen a person creates for his own benefit a trust for support or a discretionary trust, his creditors can reach the maximum amount which the trustee, under the terms of the trust, could pay to him or apply for his benefit.""  state st. bank & trust co. v. reiser,, 636 (1979).  ""this is so even if the trust contains spendthrift provisions.""  ibid.  see ware, supra.  this concept also has been codified in the massachusetts uniform trust code.  general laws c. 203e, § 505(a)(2), inserted by st. 2012, c. 140, § 56, provides that notwithstanding the presence of a spendthrift provision, ""[w]ith respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor'spage 463benefit.""see restatement (second) of trusts § 156(2) (1959) (""where a person creates for his own benefit a trust for support or a discretionary trust, his transferee or creditors can reach the maximum amount which the trustee under the terms of the trust could pay to him or apply for his benefit"").  see also restatement (third) of trusts § 58 (2003).in cohen v. commissioner of the div. of med. assistance,, 414 (1996), cert. denied sub nom. kokoska v. bullen, 519 u.s. 1057 (1997), the supreme judicial court described self-settled spendthrift trusts as created ""for the purpose of having your cake and eating it too.""  ""under such a trust, a grantor puts his assets in a trust of which he is the beneficiary, giving his trustee discretion to pay out monies to gratify his needs but limiting that discretion so that the trustee may not pay the grantor's debts.""  ibid.  the court noted that this jurisdiction and others have long followed the restatement principle for self-settled trusts.  ibid.on appeal, keybank and jean ""do not quibble with this well-established principle"" applicable to self-settled trusts, and even agree that the motion judge correctly applied g. l. c. 203e, § 505(a)(2), in concluding that the funds contributed to the trust by mcinerney from his own accounts are available to the plaintiffs.  keybank and jean contend only that the rule does not apply to the trust assets supplied by stone.  thus, determination of whether the trust is self-settled or settled by stone is at the heart of this dispute.b.  self-settled.  in order for creditors to reach trust assets where a person created a trust for support or a discretionary trust for his own benefit, it is not necessary that the beneficiary shall have himself conveyed the property held in trust.  restatement (third) of trusts § 58 comment f (2003).  it is enough that the beneficiary provide consideration.  ibid.  ""a trust is established by the person who provides the consideration for the trust even though in formpage 464it is created by someone else.""  romo v. kirschner, 181 ariz. 239, 241-242 (ct. app. 1995), quoting from forsyth v. rowe, 226 conn. 818, 826 (1993).  ""[i]t is the beneficiary's entitlement to the settlement proceeds, not whether they were literally paid into his hands, that indicates whether the beneficiary funded the trust.""  id. at 242.whether the trust was self-settled by mcinerney for the purpose of the plaintiffs' claims regarding the trust property requires us to look beyond the labels adopted in the trust instrument and the asa.  cf. in re village green realty trust, 113 b.r. 105, 114 (bankr. d. mass. 1990), quoting from in re dolton lodge trust no. 35188, 22 b.r. 918, 925 (bankr. n.d. ill. 1982) (in determining whether trust is eligible for bankruptcy even though labeled nominee trust, focus is not on label but ""on what the debtor actually is and the purpose it has been created to carry out"").  thus, the terms identifying the settlor as stone or the accounts held by stone as her individual assets rather than as marital assets were not binding on the motion judge or on the plaintiffs for determining whether the plaintiffs may reach the trust.  it would be anomalous indeed if a settlor could avoid the well-settled principle that one cannot avoid creditors through a self-settled trust by the simple expedient of identifying another person in the trust instrument as the settlor.  rather, in determining whether the trust was self-settled, we look to the facts surrounding the creation of the trust.here, the proper focus is on the reason stone funded the trust.  the motion judge's focus on the source of the funds was misplaced because it ignored the fact that assets previously held in stone's name were transferred to the trust in settlement of her obligations to mcinerney upon dissolution of the marriage, not as a gift.  an agreement that settles the rights of divorcing spouses with regard to property, maintenance, and support is based on valuable consideration.  see handrahan v. moore,, 303 (1955).  mcinerney's agreement to settle his rights and obligations pursuant to the dissolution of the marriage was the consideration for the creation of the trust.  stone was not gifting her money to mcinerney; she was satisfying her obligations arising from the dissolution of the marriage.  accordingly, mcinerney had a legal right to the monies that funded the trust.  that he agreed through his guardian to have the funds deposited into the trust does not alter the fact that these funds represented the agreed-upon equitable division due him incident to the divorce.page 456even though there are no massachusetts cases directly on point, our reasoning finds support in the case law.  in cohen, 423 mass. at 422-423, a beneficiary of a trust argued that, for the purpose of qualifying for medicaid, she was not the settlor of a trust but, rather, her conservator established the trust with proceeds of a medical malpractice settlement and pursuant to a decree of the probate and family court.  in rejecting that argument, the court cited cases from other jurisdictions where trusts were considered self-funded by beneficiaries even though they were created by conservators and guardians of the beneficiaries, sometimes with court approval, and funded with settlement proceeds from the beneficiaries' personal injury actions and workers' compensation claims.  see id. at 422, and cases cited.  the court reasoned that ""[a] conservator, like a guardian, has only the care and management of the ward's estate, and title to it . . . never vests in him but remains in the ward.""  id. at 423, quoting from minnehan v. minnehan,, 670 (1958).in in re tosi, 383 b.r. 1, 4 (bankr. d. mass. 2008), the debtor's portion of his father's estate was placed into a discretionary trust.  the debtor argued that the trust was not self-settled because the trust property passed directly from the executors to the trustees of the trust.  id. at 13.  the court rejected the argument because the monies that funded the trust ""were monies that [the debtor] was legally entitled to receive and did receive from the settlement of his father's estate.  in other words, there can be no dispute that the monies that funded [the trust] were attributable to the [d]ebtor's share of his father's estate.""  ibid.we see no meaningful distinction between the facts considered in cohen, those considered in in re tosi, and the facts here.  mcinerney's legal and equitable rights in the settlement of the parties' rights and obligations upon dissolution of the marriage was the impetus behind the creation of the trust and, therefore, he properly is considered the settlor.  compare miller v. ibarra, 746 f. supp. 19, 30 (d. colo. 1990) (trust created by courts for incompetent person pursuant to state statute not self-settled).  that the monies that funded the trust came from stone's individual accounts is not controlling where she contributed the funds in satisfaction of her obligations related to the dissolution of the marriage.we reject the premise adopted by the motion judge that because certain accounts that funded the trust were in stone's name during the marriage and may have derived from trusts of which she was the sole beneficiary, they could not be considered to bepage 466part of the marital estate.""inherited assets, including an interest in trust property established by one spouse's parents,"" or, as in this case, a grandparent, ""may comprise part of a marital estate for purposes of possible division under g. l. c. 208, § 34.""  ruml v. ruml,, 511 (2000).  while the parties chose to define in the asa certain bank accounts held solely by stone as stone's assets,there is nothing in the record to suggest that accounts held in stone's name were not available to satisfy stone's obligations to mcinerney at the time of the divorce.  to the contrary, the parties mutually agreed that mcinerney was entitled to thirty-five percent of the funds in these accounts to be paid into the trust.  accordingly, the parties, when they executed the asa, and the probate and family court judge when he approved it, determined that the assets were properly divided between the parties.the suggestion that the trust could not have been self-settled because mcinerney's name was not on the accounts during the marriage, particularly in these circumstances, is unavailing.c.  intention of the parties.  it appears to have been the intent of the parties to the asa to create a valid spendthrift trust thatpage 467would protect the trust's assets from mcinerney's creditors.as between the parties, the terms of the asa are enforceable.  the role of the probate and family court judge in approving the asa was to ensure it was free of fraud and coercion, and fair and reasonable in the circumstances.  see dominick v. dominick,, 91 (1984).  while the asa set forth the terms of the trust, including the spendthrift provision, there was no evidence that the probate and family court judge was asked to decide whether the trust instrument would in fact protect mcinerney's portion of the marital estate from creditors.mcinerney and stone were free to settle the rights and obligations between them in an enforceable contract.  however, by the terms agreed upon in the asa, they were not free to except the trust from g. l. c. 203e, § 505(a)(2), with regard to a creditor's effort to reach the trust to satisfy any judgment against mcinerney.  if, as it would appear, their intent was to keep mcinerney's funds out of the hands of his creditors, they could not do so by transferring his share of the marital estate into a spendthrift trust over which the trustees had discretion to pay to him both the principal and the interest of the trust during his lifetime.  cf. guerriero v. commissioner of the div. of med. assistance,, 633, 635 (2001).  here, the proper application of g. l. c. 203e, § 505(a)(2), allows the plaintiffs to access the trust in the circumstances presented.finally, we have considered whether mcinerney's cognitive impairments, which caused him to be placed under guardianship, give him a special status in terms of self-settled spendthrift trusts that are approved by a judge in the course of approving a separation agreement.  the parties have pointed us to no

1672,commonwealth  vs.  roberto alvarado.,"controlled substances.  practice, criminal, required finding.at the trial of a criminal complaint charging the defendant with distribution of a class b substance and committing a drug violation near a park, the judge did not err in denying the defendant's motion for required findings of not guilty, where, even though the defendant's conviction of distribution was based entirely on circumstantial evidence, that evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, was sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [471-472] maldonado, j., dissenting.","we are called upon to address whether there was sufficient circumstantial evidence presented in this case to justify the judge's denial of the defendant's motion for required findings of not guilty.  concluding that the evidence was sufficient, we affirm the defendant's convictions.background.  a jury convicted the defendant of distribution of a class b substance (g. l. c. 94c, § 32a[a]) and committing a drug violation near a park (g. l. c. 94c, § 32j).  at the close of evidence, the defendant moved for required findings of not guilty, which the judge denied.the jury would have been warranted in finding the following facts.  at approximately 1:45 p.m. on april 15, 2016, members of the lawrence police department's narcotics unit were patrolling in the area of a park, in response to recent complaints about drug activity in the area, when a car with maine license plates stopped alongside the park and the defendant got in the car.  based on theirpage 470training and experience, the officerswere aware that many people come to lawrence from new hampshire or maine to buy narcotics, generally in areas close to the highway, such as the park in question.  once the defendant entered the car, it traveled approximately 150 yards, turning once, before it stopped and the defendant got out.  nothing in the way the parties acted during that brief drive directly indicated a drug transaction had taken place; no hand-to-hand exchange or similar action was observed.  concluding that he had reasonable suspicion to believe a drug transaction had just taken place, the officer who was following the car conducted a motor vehicle stop.  the car did not immediately stop.upon stopping, the driver of the vehicle was observed moving around in the vehicle with a clenched hand, such that the officer asked him to step out of the car for safety purposes.  that officer discovered two ""twists"" of what was determined to be cocaineclenched in the driver's hand.upon recovering the cocaine, that officer radioed another officer who was following the defendant and instructed him to arrest the defendant.  the officer did so, and in a subsequent search of the defendant discovered fifty-six dollars in cash.  both the driver of the vehicle and the defendant were in view of police officers from the time the defendant entered the vehicle until the time each was arrested.in addition to the testimony of the two officers, the jury also heard from a state police trooper who offered expert testimony regarding drug transactions.  he opined that ""the most common scenario"" of a street-level drug transaction is that a person arrives from out of town, makes a telephone call to place an order, and is instructed to go to a certain location.  once there, either the drug dealer or a ""runner"" for that dealer will meet the buyer and ""the delivery is usually concluded inside of the car, either while the car is moving or while it remains parked.""  the expert further testified that a ""ride to nowhere,"" such as the brief ride the defendant was observed taking in the car, ""very rarely [has] an explanation other than that it was a drug deal.""  finally, the expert noted that a small amount of cocaine in lawrence, such as was found in each of the twists held by the driver, is ""as a general rule, [worth] betweenpage 471[twenty] and [thirty]"" dollars.discussion.  on appeal, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove his distribution charge, and therefore, his motion for required findings of not guilty should have been allowed.  in evaluating sufficiency, we must determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, ""'rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt' (emphasis in original).""  commonwealth v. latimore,, 677 (1979), quoting from jackson v. virginia, 443 u.s. 307, 318-319 (1979).  ""circumstantial evidence is competent to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,"" and in a sufficiency inquiry, we consider both direct evidence and ""reasonable and possible"" inferences from that evidence, so long as they are ""not too remote in the ordinary course of events, or forbidden by any rule of law.""  commonwealth v. cotto,, 591-592 (2007) (citations omitted).  ""while the inferences drawn must be reasonable, they 'need not be necessary or inescapable.'""  commonwealth v. merry,, 661 (2009), quoting from commonwealth v. grandison,, 140-141 (2001).although the defendant's conviction of distribution was based entirely on circumstantial evidence, we conclude that the evidence before the jury, viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, was sufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  under g. l. c. 94c, § 32a(a), the commonwealth bore the burden of proving that the defendant knowingly or intentionally distributed cocaine.  several pieces of evidence pointed to a drug transaction, including:  the out-of-state license plate, the park's proximity to the highway, the ""ride to nowhere,"" the brevity of the interaction between the defendant and the vehicle's driver, the vehicle's driver not immediately stopping the vehicle and moving conspicuously upon stopping, the money recovered from the defendant's person, the lawrence police department's awareness of recent complaints of drug activity in the area of that park, and the recovery of cocaine from the driver.  it is true that there are scenarios that could explain the defendant's behavior in a way that would not support his conviction.  the commonwealth, however, ""need not exclude every hypothesis,"" and the evidence presented was sufficient to allow the case to reach the jury.  commonwealth v. soto,, 112 (1998).  ""the inference that the defendant sold the drugs 'need not be necessarypage 472or inescapable so long as it is reasonable and possible.'""  ibid., quoting from commonwealth v. cohen,, 380 (1992).we conclude that, in this case, the commonwealth presented ""evidence from which a finder [could without speculation] infer the essential facts"" to support the defendant's conviction.  soto, supra, quoting from commonwealth v. robinson,, 262 (1997).  a hand-to-hand transaction need not be viewed by police in every distribution case, and the lack of evidence recovered from the defendant other than the fifty-six dollars in cash is not fatal to the commonwealth's case.  see soto, supra.  it is not our place to ""attempt to penetrate the jury's thought process,"" commonwealth v. santos,, 777 (2009), and since there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to reach their verdict, we will not disturb the judge's decision to leave the choice in the jury's hands.judgments affirmed.because i conclude that the evidence of fifty-six dollars found in the defendant's possession and two ""twists"" of cocaine, valued between forty and sixty dollars, discovered in the hands of the driver of the car the defendant was seen entering and leaving, fails to substantiate, without more, that the defendant distributed drugs, even with the additional expert testimony regarding the usual modus operandi of narcotic exchanges in south lawrence common park, i respectfully dissent.one early april afternoon in south lawrence common park, police, while stationed in an unmarked cruiser, observed the defendant enter the passenger's side of a car displaying maine license plates.  the car drove about 150 yards; it then stopped and the defendant got out.  neither the defendant nor the operator were known to police, and the police did not overhear any conversations or observe any hand movements or exchanges between the defendant and the operator before the defendant and the car's operator parted company.the car began to drive away, but the police activated their cruiser's lights and siren, signaling the car's operator to stop thepage 473vehicle.  the car continued for a short distance before stopping.  as the officer approached the stopped vehicle, he observed the operator moving about in the car's interior, and so, for his safety, the officer ordered the operator to step out.  the operator exited the vehicle with clenched fists containing two ""twists"" of cocaine.meanwhile, the defendant was walking away on foot.  however, he was stopped five minutes later by a second officer, who learned from the first about the cocaine in the hands of the car's operator.  the second officer searched the defendant and found fifty-six dollars in unspecified denominations on the defendant's person.  there was no testimony that the bills were separated in any particular way.the remainder of the commonwealth's proof came from the testimony of a police expert, who testified to the general manner in which narcotics are bought and sold in lawrence.  the expert opined that out-of-state buyers ""most common[ly]"" do business in lawrence by arranging to meet a seller of drugs or his ""runner,"" to engage in an exchange during a short ""ride to nowhere.""  the expert also testified that each cocaine twist sells for between twenty and thirty dollars.the commonwealth asserts, and the majority agrees, that the expert testimony regarding the usual pattern of narcotics sales in lawrence, coupled with the discovery of the two twists of cocaine in the operator's possession and fifty-six dollars on the defendant's person is sufficient to support a rational juror in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant sold drugs to the car's operator.  i disagree.in cases such as this, where, in the absence of direct observations of a narcotics exchange, the commonwealth relies on generalizations regarding the modus operandi of drug dealers, there must be more corroborative evidence than the mere discovery of a small quantity of cash on the purported dealer's person.  see commonwealth v. sepheus,, 166 (2014) (concluding that the $312 found on the defendant's person was ""not a particularly large sum,"" and observing that, while ""[a] large amount of cash certainly is probative of an intent to distribute[,] . . . [i]t is not unusual for law-abiding persons to carry . . . [a small] amount on their person"").examples of cases where the commonwealth overcame the lack of direct evidence of a drug transaction include the following.  in commonwealth v. stephens,, 387-388 (2008), where the expert opined that buyers usually arrive at anpage 474agreed-upon location before the seller, and get into the seller's vehicle to make the exchange, the commonwealth introduced evidence that police saw the codefendant make furtive movements toward a center console (where approximately $340 worth of cocaine was stored), and the defendant had $345 and drug packaging paraphernalia on his lap and in his pockets when stopped.in another such case, commonwealth v. clark,, 624-625 (2006), it was the direct evidence of a prior exchange, in which clark was observed accepting money in exchange for what was believed to be drugs, that identified clark as the seller in a later narcotics sale where there was no direct evidence of an exchange.by contrast, in cases with facts more analogous to the evidence in this case, the supreme judicial court has held the evidence insufficient to support even a finding of probable cause of an intent to distribute.  commonwealth v. levy,(2011), is one such example.  there, police saw no exchange, but observed a man make a twenty-second call on a pay telephone commonly used to arrange drug deals.  the man then drove to a nearby location, got out of his car, and paced up and down the street before the arrival of a second car, which he entered through the back passenger's side.  the car went on a short 200-yard ride before the back seat passenger got out.  police stopped the second car and searched both the driver and the front seat passenger.  in the absence of more corroborative evidence, the supreme judicial court held that the search of the front seat passenger lacked probable cause.  id. at 1011-1012.  similarly, in commonwealth v. stewart,(2014), police observed the defendant, a known drug dealer, and several of his companions in a part of boston's theatre district known for narcotics deals.  a woman approached the group counting money.  police then observed the group huddle together, but the police did not observe an exchange of money for drugs.  id. at 259-260.  reasoning that, although there is no requisite ""that an officer must actually see an object exchanged, the suspect's movements, as observed by the officer, must provide factual support for the inference that the parties exchanged an object,"" the supreme judicial court concluded the police lacked probable cause to search the contents of a cigarettepage 475box in the defendant's backpack.  id. at 261, 263-265 (quotation omitted).here, considering the elevated standard of proof required to sustain a criminal conviction, the inference that the defendant sold drugs simply because he possessed fifty-six dollars and the car's operator possessed two twists of cocaine is even less supportable.  contrary to the commonwealth's assertions, it is not the defendant's burden to offer an explanation for his presence in the car.  see commonwealth v. walker,, 223 (2005) (""[t]he burden of proof never shifts to the defendant, . . . because he is presumed innocent, and . . . all presumptions of law are in favor of innocence"").  rather, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth must be sufficient to satisfy a rational juror of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  see commonwealth v. latimore,, 677-678 (1979) (""[t]o sustain the denial of a directed verdict, it is not enough . . . that there was some record evidence, however slight, to support each essential element of the offense; [there must be] enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each such element beyond a reasonable doubt"").in the instant case, the evidence does not permit the inference that the car's operator was a consumer of drugs or that the defendant was the distributor of those drugs.  see commonwealth v. white,, 136 (2008) (inferences must be ""reasonable and possible"" and not based on mere ""conjecture and speculation"" [citations omitted]).  contrast commonwealth v. dancy,, 176-179 (2009) (where a woman's immediate consumption of cocaine after interacting with the defendant, and the defendant's possession of three cellular telephones [cell phones] and $536 -- including one twenty dollar bill found crumpled in a separate pocket -- gave rise to the reasonable inference that the woman was a buyer and the defendant was the seller).while the expert here testified that ""most common[ly]"" out-of-state buyers come to lawrence to purchase narcotics, that testimony did not exclude the possibility of the out-of-state operator's coming to lawrence to sell drugs or for some other nefarious reason.  the suggestion that south lawrence common park's location provides easy highway access to out-of-state ""buyers"" is also equally applicable to an out-of-state operator looking to sell drugs.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. saletino,, 661-662 (2007) (defendant drove a car with rhodepage 476island plates when selling cocaine to an undercover officer in lynn); commonwealth v. kimball,, 604-605 (1994) (although the police conducted an illegal stop, which fatally undermined the defendant's conviction, he was driving a car with maine plates while trafficking over 200 grams of cocaine in massachusetts); commonwealth v. powers,, 912-913 (1995) (defendant drove a car with florida plates while dealing drugs in berkshire county); commonwealth v. savageau,, 518-519 (1997) (defendant convicted of possession with intent to distribute after police saw him deal ""crack"" cocaine out of a car with new hampshire plates).furthermore, nothing about the automobile operator's possession of the two twists of cocaine distinguishes him as a consumer of drugs rather than a ""seller"" of drugs.  even though the car's operator did not stop immediately for the police and was observed moving about in the car, there was no evidence of his ingesting drugs, putting his fists towards his mouth in an attempt to ingest drugs, or being in possession of any drug ingesting paraphernalia.  accordingly, his possession is equally consistent with that of a seller of drugs.  contrast commonwealth v. dancy, 75 mass. app. ct. at 177, where, inter alia, it was a woman's immediate consumption of drugs after parting company with the defendant that distinguished her as the defendant's buyer.similarly, the defendant's possession of fifty-six dollars does not, without more, give rise to a reasonable inference that he had just sold drugs.  see commonwealth v. tripp,, 998 (1982) (evidence that one person was in possession of eight glassine bags of heroin while another was counting money did not distinguish one individual as the seller or the other as the buyer).commonwealth v. dancy, in particular, provides an example of the extent of corroborative evidence needed to properly support a conviction.  there, police observed dancy meet with a woman who had been anxiously awaiting his arrival.  she was pacing up and down the street.  the two met briefly and parted company after about one minute.  police next observed the woman ingesting drugs.  that case also included expert testimony regarding the clandestine nature of street drug sales and, further, that cocaine sells in ""denominations of ten dollars, twenty dollars, and higher.""  when dancy was stopped shortly after the woman was observed consuming drugs, he was found in possession of threepage 477cell phones and $536, including one twenty dollar bill found crumpled in a pocket separate from the other monies.  in that case, as we have noted, the woman's immediate ingestion of cocaine after her brief encounter with dancy distinguished her as a buyer of drugs, and dancy's possession of the three cell phones and a large sum of money, with one lone crumpled up twenty dollar bill in a separate pocket (suggesting that it had just been quickly stored away) gave rise to the reasonable inference that he had just sold drugs to the woman.  75 mass. app. ct. at 176-179.  by contrast, in the instant case, there was no evidence that the defendant had in his possession any, let alone multiple, cell phones, and, aside from the fifty-six dollars falling within the dollar range for a sale of two twists, there was nothing to suggest that the money came from the defendant's sale of drugs to the car's operator.  the defendant was not seen getting out of the car with bills in hand or stuffing cash into his pocket.  there was no testimony about how the money was pocketed, let alone in a manner that suggested it had just been quickly put away.the mere possibility that the defendant may have sold drugs on that day is not enough.  the evidence must be sufficient to satisfy a rational juror, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant transferred drugs to the car's operator.  commonwealth v. latimore, 378 mass. at 677-678.  to satisfy that burden, the evidence must exclude any other reasonable hypothesis.  see commonwealth v. labriola,, 573-574 (2000).  i am not persuaded the evidence here meets that strict burden.  in my view, the evidence does not exclude the equally reasonable possibilities that either the two men met for some other reason and there was no sale of drugs in the car on that day, or that the defendant was the purchaser of drugs, which he consumed in the five minutes from when the lights and sirens were activated to when he was stopped.i would therefore reverse the judgments, set aside the verdicts, and order judgments to enter for the defendant.",criminal,Michael A.

1673,commonwealth  vs.  paulo monteiro.,"controlled substances.  constitutional law, search and seizure, probable cause.  search and seizure, probable cause, warrant, affidavit.  practice, criminal, motion to suppress.a superior court judge erred in allowing the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence gathered from his apartment pursuant to a search warrant, where, for purposes of establishing probable cause for the issuance of the warrant, a single controlled buy of cocaine, although imperfectly executed (i.e., the police did not observe the confidential police informant's entry into and exit from the defendant's apartment building), nevertheless sufficiently corroborated the information provided by the first-time confidential informant. [480-485]","in this interlocutory appeal by the commonwealth, we must decide whether the information provided by a first-time, confidential police informant (ci) was sufficiently corroborated by a single, imperfectly executed controlled ""buy"" of cocaine for the purposes of establishing probable cause for the issuance of a warrant to search the defendant's apartment.  we conclude that the affidavit was sufficient to establish the ci's basis of knowledge and veracity, and that the information provided by the ci, alongpage 479with information gathered by the police, as set forth in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, established probable cause.  accordingly, we reverse the order allowing the defendant's motion to suppress.background.  the affidavit filed as part of the warrant application contained the following facts.in november, 2015, detective gracia of the new bedford police department spoke with the ci, whose identity and whereabouts were known to the police.the ci stated that they had contacted the defendant, paulo monteiro, by telephone or had ""show[n] up [at] his residence"" in new bedford to purchase cocaine in the past.  the ci informed detective gracia that they continue to purchase cocaine from the defendant.  the ci provided detective gracia with a physical description of the seller (""a cape verdean male 20 years old approx 6' tall with a medium build"") and the seller's address.  detective gracia confirmed via the police department's computer system that a person named paulo monteiro had the same listed address as that provided by the ci.  detective gracia also reviewed the defendant's criminal record and determined that he was on probation for statutory rape.  a booking photograph of the defendant was shown to the ci.  the ci stated that the person in the photograph, whom the ci identified as the defendant, was the person who had sold cocaine to the ci in the past.detective gracia later met the ci to arrange a controlled buy of cocaine from the defendant.  the ci was searched and determined to be free of contraband and money.  detective gracia then gave the ci money to purchase cocaine from the defendant.  detective gracia and other members of the new bedford police department maintained surveillance of the ci.  they observed the ci walking toward the rear exterior door of the defendant's apartment building.a short time later, the ci was seen leaving the walkway leading to the rear exterior door.  the defendant was not observed entering or exiting the apartment building through the rear exteriorpage 480door.  the ci was kept under surveillance until the ci met detective gracia at a predetermined location where the ci provided detective gracia with a quantity of what the ci said was cocaine.  the ci stated that they purchased the cocaine from the defendant inside his first-floor apartment.  the ci was again searched and determined to be free of money and contraband.  the material the ci turned over to the police was field tested and found to be cocaine.detective gracia applied for, and a magistrate subsequently issued, a warrant to search the defendant's apartment.  upon execution of the search warrant, the police found narcotics and drug paraphernalia inside the defendant's apartment.  an indictment was returned against the defendant for trafficking in cocaine.  see g. l. c. 94c, § 32e(b).  the defendant moved to suppress the contraband and related drug paraphernalia found during the search on the basis that the affidavit provided to the magistrate did not establish probable cause.  the defendant's motion to suppress was allowed after the motion judge concluded that the affidavit failed to establish both the ci's basis of knowledge and veracity.  for the reasons set forth below, we reverse.discussion.  article 14 of the massachusetts declaration of rights requires that a search warrant issue only upon a showing of probable cause.  commonwealth v. foster,, 241 (2015).  in determining whether the probable cause standard was met, our inquiry ""begins and ends with the 'four corners of the affidavit'"" supporting the application for the search warrant.  commonwealth v. o'day,, 297 (2003), quoting from commonwealth v. villella,, 428 (1995). ""because a determination of probable cause is a conclusion of law, we review a search warrant affidavit de novo.""  foster, supra at 242.in commonwealth v. upton,, 373 (1985) (upton ii), the supreme judicial court determined that ""art. 14 provides more substantive protection to criminal defendants than does the fourth amendment"" to the united states constitution.  when an affidavit in support of a search warrant is based on information supplied by an unknown informant, art. 14 requires the magistrate called upon to issue a search warrant to apply the so-called aguilar-spinelli test to assess whether the affidavit is sufficient to establish probable cause to issue the warrant.  see aguilar v. texas, 378 u.s. 108 (1964); spinelli v. united states,page 481393 u.s. 410 (1969).""where information from an unidentified informant is relied on to supply probable cause to search, art. 14 . . . requires that the affidavit apprise the magistrate of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was credible or the information reliable (the veracity test).""commonwealth v. warren,, 88 (1994).the defendant concedes, and we agree, that the basis of knowledge test was satisfied by the ci's statement that they had purchased cocaine from the defendant inside the target apartment within seventy-two hours of the warrant issuing.  see commonwealth v. desper,, 166 (1994).we next examine whether the veracity prong has been satisfied.  the affidavit submitted to the magistrate indicated that the ci was a first-time, confidential police informant, which rendered the statements made by the ci contained in the affidavit, standing alone, insufficient to satisfy the veracity prong of the aguilar-spinelli test.  see commonwealth v. alfonso a.,, 376 (2003) (""although police knowledge of the ci's 'identity' and 'whereabouts' would not be adequate standing alone to confirm the informant's reliability, it is a factor that weighs inpage 482favor of reliability""); commonwealth v. figueroa,, 787 (2009) (information from first-time informant ""ordinarily would not meet the veracity requirements imposed by art. 14"").however, ""a properly monitored controlled purchase of illegal drugs provides sufficient corroborating evidence to overcome any shortfalls in meeting the constitutional reliability requirements imposed on confidential informants.""  figueroa, supra at 787-788.  see commonwealth v. luna,, 134 (1991) (two controlled purchases of narcotics by confidential informant were sufficient, standing alone, to provide probable cause to search defendant's home);

villella, 39 mass. app. ct. at 427-428 (probable cause established where police corroborated portions of informant's detailed tip and informant made single controlled buy at defendant's residence through intermediary).  see also commonwealth v. cruz,, 842 n.2 (2000), citing warren, supra.in desper, 419 mass. at 168, the supreme judicial court set forth the essential components of a controlled buy:""(1) a police officer meets the informant at a location other than the location where is it suspected that criminal activity is occurring; (2) the officer searches the informant to ensure the informant has no drugs on his person and (usually) furnishes the informant with money to purchase drugs; (3) the officer escorts or follows the informant to the premises where it is alleged illegal activity is occurring and watches the informant enter and leave those premises; and (4) the informant turns over to the officer the substance the informant has purchased from the residents of the premises under surveillance.""here, the affidavit does not indicate that the affiant observed the ci's physical entry into, or exit from, the building housing thepage 483defendant's apartment during the course of the controlled buy.the defendant argues that this deficiency in the controlled buy rendered the information provided by the ci unreliable for the purposes of establishing probable cause.although ""the steps customary in a controlled buy should be taken"" when a controlled buy is being used to corroborate a statement made by a confidential informant that otherwise would not be sufficient to establish probable cause, id. at 170, probable cause may nevertheless be established where the police fail to comply with one of the four investigatory steps customarily associated with a controlled buy.see id. at 170-171 (probable cause requirement was met where police failed to search confidential informant for contraband before two controlled buys).  here, the magistrate was not compelled to conclude that because the police did not observe the ci's physical entry into and exit from the apartment building, the information contained in the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause.  in the circumstances of this case, the police observation of the ci walking toward the door to the building and then a few minutes later walking away from that area and turning over a quantity of drugs, when coupled with the other facts, was sufficient to support the magistrate's conclusion that the ci was credible.  in cases involving a controlled buy of drugs from a seller who is located inside a multiunit building, we do not require that the police observe the informant enter the particular apartment where the transaction is reported to have occurred in order to demonstrate the reliability of the informant.  see warren, 418 mass. at 90 (""it is not fatal to the warrant application that the police did not observe which of the three apartments the informant entered.  based on the information provided by the informant and their own observations, the police could infer that the defendant was dealing drugs from his second-floor apartment"").""in dealing with probable cause . . . we deal with probabilities.  these are not technical;

[488-492]at the trial of a criminal complaint charging larceny of property with a value exceeding $250 from a person sixty years of age or older, in violation of g. l. c. 266, § 30(5), the defendant failed to preserve the defense that she had an honest but mistaken belief that she had permission to use the victim's debit card, given that she did not give notice of the defense in accordance with mass.r.crim.p. 14(b)(3), and in any event, even assuming that she had adequately raised the defense, the commonwealth provided sufficient evidence to disprove it. [492-493]at a criminal trial, the prosecutor's statement in closing argument that the defendant admitted to everything did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, where the prosecutor immediately went on to make statements concerning the defendant's admissions that were firmly grounded in the evidence, and although the comment was perhaps hyperbolic, it did not warrant reversal. [493-494]there was no merit to a criminal defendant's argument, raised on direct appeal on the trial record alone, that her trial counsel was ineffective, where there was no affidavit from trial counsel and the factual basis of the claim did not appear indisputably on the trial record. [494]","a jury convicted the defendant of assault and battery causing bodily injury on a person sixty years of age or older, in violation of g. l. c. 265, § 13k(b), and larceny of property with a value exceeding $250 from a person sixty years of age or older, in violation of g. l. c. 266, § 30(5).  on appeal she argues that the commonwealth failed to prove that the victim suffered a ""bodily injury"" within the meaning of g. l. c. 265, § 13k(b), that her larceny conviction cannot stand because the commonwealth failed to disprove her claim of honest yet mistaken belief, that the prosecutor misstated the evidence in his closing argument, and that her trial counsel was ineffective.  construing the term ""bodily injury,"" defined in g. l. c. 265, § 13k(a), as an injury that considerably or significantly compromises the usual functioning of any part of a victim's body, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction under § 13k(b).  as we also reject the defendant's remaining arguments, we affirm.background.  we summarize the evidence and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the commonwealth.  see commonwealth v. latimore,, 676-677 (1979).  the victim was born in 1936 and met the defendant in 2007.  their relationship started as a romantic one but evolved into ""a friendship type thing.""  throughout the course of their relationship, the defendant often stayed at the victim's home, sometimes up to a week at a time.from november of 2013 to january of 2015, the victim noticed that there were unauthorized withdrawals and other transactions on each of his monthly debit card statements.  in total, the unauthorized charges amounted to several thousand dollars.  the victim had not given the defendant permission to use his card during this periodand questioned her multiple times about the charges, telling her that he ""was getting behind on his bills.""  each time, the defendant admitted using the card but said that she did so only after checking the account balance to ensure that enough funds were available.on december 12, 2014, while at the defendant's apartment, the victim again questioned her about the money missing from his account.  as the victim was preparing to leave, the defendant ""blindsided"" him and hit him from behind with a ""tremendous . . .page 488blow,"" causing him to fall to the hardwood floor.  the victim ""was in great pain"" and felt ""a burning sensation in the lower back and . . . hip area.""  he spent two to three hours at the hospital, where he was diagnosed with an elbow abrasion and hip contusion and was prescribed pain medication.  although hospital staff wanted him to use a walker, the victim declined because he wanted to stay as ""mobile as [he] possibly could.""in mid- to late december of 2014, the victim's neighbor observed that he ""seemed to be deteriorating as far as walking""; he ""was limping a lot,"" ""seemed to be in a lot of pain,"" and ""would take . . . about [fifteen] minutes to get up [a twenty-foot] driveway.""  according to the neighbor, the victim did not exhibit these symptoms during the first half of the month.  an officer investigating the incident in late december of 2014 likewise observed that the victim ""was very slow, had a limp, [and] looked like he was injured.""  ultimately, it took several weeks before the victim's pain subsided and he started regaining mobility on his injured side.discussion.  1.  ""bodily injury.""  general laws c. 265, § 13k, proscribes assault and battery on an elderly personor a person with a disability and sets out three levels of penalties based on the severity of the bodily injury sustained.  see g. l. c. 265, § 13k(a1/2) (assault and battery); g. l. c. 265, § 13k(b) (assault and battery causing ""bodily injury""); g. l. c. 265, § 13k(c) (assault and battery causing ""serious bodily injury"").  the relevant provision here, § 13k(b), inserted by st. 1995, c. 297, § 4, provides that ""[w]hoever commits an assault and battery upon an elder or person with a disability and by such assault and battery causes bodily injury shall be punished.""  ""bodily injury"" is defined as a ""substantial impairment of the physical condition, including, but not limited to, any burn, fracture of any bone, subdural hematoma, injury to any internal organ, or any injury which occurs as the result of repeated harm to any bodily function or organ, including human skin.""  g. l. c. 265, § 13k(a), inserted by st. 1995, c. 297, § 4.at issue is the degree of severity required for an injury to constitute a ""substantial impairment of the physical condition"" within the meaning of §§ 13k(a) and (b).  in construing this phrase, we look first to the statute's plain language and will give ""'effect consistent with its plain meaning and in light of the aimpage 489of the legislature' unless to do so would achieve an 'absurd' or 'illogical' result.""  commonwealth v. scott,, 358 (2013), quoting from sullivan v. brookline,, 360 (2001).  as a general matter, ""[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language.""  scott, 464 mass. at 358, quoting from opinion of the justices,, 781-782 (1943).  ""[t]echnical terms,"" however, ""should be read in a manner that is consistent with [their technical] meaning.""  ibid.in scott the supreme judicial court, interpreting ""impairment"" as used in g. l. c. 265, § 13a(b)(i),concluded that the word ""draws its meaning from the medical context, where definitions emphasize an injury's impact on the structure of a part of the victim's anatomy and its ability to serve its usual role in the body.""  scott, 464 mass. at 358.  we likewise conclude that ""impairment"" in § 13k(a) derives from the medical context, as we presume that the legislature intended the word to have a consistent meaning throughout the statutory sections criminalizing assault and battery.  see commonwealth v. wynton w.,, 747 (2011), quoting from insurance rating bd. v. commissioner of ins.,, 188-189 (1969) (""where the legislature uses the same words in several sections which concern the same subject matter, the words 'must be presumed to have been used with the same meaning in each section'"").  thus, drawing from the definition in scott, we construe ""impairment of the physical condition"" to mean damage to any body part that ""compromise[s] its ability to perform its function in the victim's body.""  scott, 464 mass. at 359.in determining what degree of impairment is required, we are guided by the neighboring word ""substantial.""  see commonwealth v. magnus m.,, 462 (2012), quoting from commonwealth v. brooks,, 428 (1974) (""we . . . interpret 'words in a statute . . . in light of the other words surrounding them'"").  we give ""substantial"" its usual and accepted meaning, which is ""considerable in quantity"" or ""significantly great.""  merriam-webster's collegiate dictionary 1245 (11th ed. 2005).  a ""substantial impairment of the physical condition""page 490therefore occurs where an injury considerably or significantly compromises the usual functioning of any part of the victim's body.contrary to the defendant's assertion, the statute does not require the commonwealth to prove that the victim suffered one of the enumerated examples of ""bodily injury,"" such as a burn or fracture.  the enumeration is illustrative, see scott, 464 mass. at 359, but plainly nonexclusive, as shown by the preceding phrase, ""including but not limited to.""  g. l. c. 265, § 13k(a).  in trying to evade this plain language, the defendant relies on commonwealth v. chapman,(2001), in particular, on its statement that g. l. c. 265, § 13j,""defines the bodily injuries the legislature intended to be punishable under the statute, i.e., burns, fractures, injuries to internal organs, [and] perilous physical conditions.""  chapman, 433 mass. at 484.  the defendant suggests that the court's use of ""i.e."" means that it determined the enumerated examples to be exclusive.  we do not believe, however, that the court intended for ""including,"" which precedes the enumeration in § 13j(a), to have no meaning.  rather, the court's statement is best read in light of the last item it listed, ""perilous physical conditions,"" which is a general term that does not limit the statutory definition to any specific type of injury.  indeed, the court went on to conclude that the victim's injury, asphyxiation, constituted a ""substantial impairment of the physical condition"" without analyzing whether it fell within one of the enumerated examples.  ibid.we also reject the defendant's suggestion that the degree of impairment required for a conviction under § 13k(b) is comparable to what is required by scott.  again, scott concerned a conviction of assault and battery resulting in ""serious bodily injury.""  464 mass. at 358.  as § 13k(c) provides for enhanced penalties for assault and battery on an elder causing ""serious bodily injury,""it is plain that an impairment of some lesser gravity will qualify as a ""bodily injury"" under § 13k(b).page 491at the same time, we reject the commonwealth's position that any injury qualifies as a ""bodily injury"" so long as it is more than merely ""transient and trifling.""  in the case on which the commonwealth relies, commonwealth v. burno,(1986), the defendant was convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon under a theory of reckless conduct. id. at 625.  proof of injury is relevant under that theory because the reckless act plus actual physical injury are deemed to ""substitute[] for (or . . . allow the 'inference' of) intentional conduct.""  commonwealth v. welch,, 274 (1983).  it was in this context, divorced from any statutory language, that the burno court adopted the standard of ""more than transient and trifling.""  396 mass. at 627.the burno standard therefore does not control the question of statutory interpretation before us.  cf. scott, 464 mass. at 359 (""we . . . reject the standard urged by the commonwealth, that any injury will constitute an 'impairment' under g. l. c. 265, § 13a, if it is 'more than merely transient and trifling'"").  to establish a ""bodily injury"" under § 13k(b), the commonwealth has the higher burden of proving a ""substantial impairment of the physical condition,"" which again we interpret as an injury to any body part that considerably or significantly compromises its usual bodily function.  the injury must be comparable in gravity to one of the enumerated examples -- ""any burn, fracture, subdural hematoma, injury to any internal organ, or any injury which occurs as the result of repeated harm to any bodily function or organ, including human skin,"" g. l. c. 265, § 13k(a) -- but need not rise to the level of a ""serious bodily injury.""  see scott, 464 mass. at 359 (""degree of 'impairment' contemplated by [§ 13a(c)] is best understood when considered with"" surrounding words and clauses).  cf. zoning bd. of appeals v. housing appeals comm.,, 757 (2010) (""general phrase 'conditions and requirements' . . . cabined by the specific examples that follow it to conditions of the same or similar kind"").we turn to whether the evidence was sufficient in this case to prove that the victim suffered a ""bodily injury.""  we conclude that it was.  the victim's hip injury was severe enough to cause him pain and hamper his mobility for several weeks, so much so that he needed fifteen minutes just to walk twenty feet.  this permitted the jury to find that the injury constituted a ""substantial impairmentpage 492of the physical condition,"" as it significantly compromised the functioning of the victim's hip in his body.  cf. chapman, 433 mass. at 484 (""asphyxiation, like malnutrition or dehydration, may cause a substantial impairment of the physical condition"" and thus ""is a bodily injury within the meaning of § 13j(a)"").2.  honest but mistaken belief.  the defendant challenges her larceny conviction on the premise that the commonwealth failed to disprove her claim that she honestly believed she had permission to use the victim's debit card.  honest but mistaken belief is an affirmative defense to larceny.  see commonwealth v. liebenow,, 160 (2014); commonwealth v. st. hilaire,, 348 (2015).  to raise the defense, the defendant has the burden of production, which is satisfied if ""'any view of the evidence' would support a factual finding that the defendant honestly believed he or she had a legal right to take [the] property.""  st. hilaire, 470 mass. at 348, quoting from liebenow, 470 mass. at 156.  if the defendant meets his or her burden, the burden shifts to the commonwealth to disprove the defense.  see st. hilaire, 470 mass. at 349.in this case the defendant failed to preserve the defense because she did not give notice of it in accordance with mass.r.crim.p. 14(b)(3), as appearing in  442 mass. 1518  (2004).  that rule requires a defendant intending to rely on ""a defense based upon a . . . claim of authority"" to so notify the commonwealth before trial and file a copy of the notice with the clerk of the court.  a defendant who intends to raise a defense of honest belief ""is required to follow the mandate of rule 14(b)(3).""  commonwealth v. vives,, 542 n.4 (2006).  see reporter's notes to rule 14(b)(3) (revised 2004), massachusetts rules of court, rules of criminal procedure, at 163 (thomson reuters 2018) (""a 'claim of authority' is an assertion that the claimant has received an express or implied right to do an act from one lawfully empowered to grant such right"").  the defendant's failure to do so here means that ""claim of authority"" was ""unavailable [to her] as a defense.""  commonwealth v. o'connell,, 665 (2003).in any event, even assuming the defendant adequately raised the defense, the commonwealth provided sufficient evidence to disprove it.the victim testified that he did not give the defendant permission to use his debit card from november of 2013 to thepage 493beginning of 2015, which is when the unauthorized charges appeared on his account.  he also testified that, during that period, he questioned the defendant numerous times about the missing money and told her that he was falling behind on his bills.  furthermore, before november of 2013, the victim had permitted the defendant to use the card on only a handful of occasions to make small purchases, yet the total of the unauthorized charges amounted to thousands of dollars.  a rational jury could have rejected the defendant's claim of honest belief based on this evidence.  see liebenow, 470 mass. at 161 (""evidence of reasonableness may . . . be considered by the jury to assist in their determination whether to credit a defendant's honest belief"").3.  closing argument.  the defendant next contends that the prosecutor's statement during summation that ""the defendant admitted to everything"" mischaracterized the evidence.because the defendant did not object, we review any error for a substantialpage 494risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. st. louis,, 359 (2015).we see no error.  the prosecutor immediately went on to state that the defendant ""admitted that she did push [the victim] when the [investigating officer] called her"" and ""admitted to [the victim] numerous times that she took the money out of his account.""  these statements were firmly grounded in the evidence.  while the prosecutor's comment that the defendant admitted to ""everything"" was perhaps hyperbolic, it does not warrant reversal.  see commonwealth v. sylvia,, 195 (2010), quoting from commonwealth v. ruiz,, 835 (2004) (""excusable hyperbole is not a ground for reversal, and the jury are presumed to have a certain measure of sophistication in sorting out excessive claims on both sides"").4.  ineffective assistance of counsel.  we need not dwell on the defendant's argument that her trial counsel was ineffective.an ineffective assistance claim ""made on the trial record alone is the weakest form of such a challenge because it is bereft of any explanation by trial counsel for his actions and suggestive of strategy contrived by a defendant viewing the case with hindsight.""  commonwealth v. peloquin,, 210 n.5 (2002).  such claims may be resolved on direct appeal, as opposed to on a motion for new trial, only where ""the factual basis of the claim appears indisputably on the trial record.""  commonwealth v. zinser,, 811 (2006), quoting from commonwealth v. adamides,, 344 (1994).  this is not such a case.  we have no affidavit from counsel, and the record does not indisputably establish that his strategy was either manifestly unreasonable or ""deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.""  commonwealth v. saferian,, 96 (1974).judgments affirmed.",criminal,Michael L.

[500-504] sullivan, j., dissenting, with whom henry, j., joined.a district court judge erred in allowing a criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized during a strip search of the defendant on the ground that the strip search was conducted in violation of the police department's written strip search policy, where the strip search was conducted in a reasonable and respectful manner that outweighed any lack of prior approval by the officer in charge. [505-506]","the defendant was charged by complaint in chelsea district court with distribution of a class b controlled substance, conspiracy to violate the drug laws, and possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute.  he filed a motion to suppress evidence and statements, and challenged the validity of a strip search.  after an evidentiary hearing, the judge issued written findings which allowed, in part, the defendant's motion as it related to evidence seized pursuant to the strip search, concluding that it was not supported by probable cause and conducted in violation of a written strip search policy.  the commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal.  a single justice of the supreme judicial court allowed the commonwealth's application for leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal and reported the matter to this court.  see g. l. c. 278, § 28e; mass.r.crim.p. 15(a)(2), as appearing in  422 mass. 1501  (1996).  we conclude that the strip search was proper and therefore reverse the order which allowed, in part, the motion to suppress.1.  background.  the entirety of the commonwealth's evidence at the suppression hearing was provided by chelsea police detective jose torres, jr.  based on the evidence the judge found credible, he made the following findings of fact:a.  the surveillance.  at the relevant time, detective torres had been a member of the chelsea police department for approximately eight and one-half years.  for approximately the last one and one-half years, torres had worked as a detective assigned to the drug unit.torres was familiar with the bellingham square area of chelsea.  the bellingham square area is considered to be a high crimepage 497area.  on march 25, 2016, torres was working with lieutenant betz of the chelsea police department conducting surveillance from an unmarked cruiser while in plain clothes.  at approximately 9:00 p.m., torres and betz were parked on fourth street between the intersection of broadway and division street, an area adjacent to bellingham square.  this location, which is both residential and commercial, was chosen for surveillance after the police received citizen complaints of street level drug dealing and drug use in this area.torres and betz focused their attention on a multifamily residential building located at 9-11 fourth street (the building).  the building was approximately eighty feet from the police surveillance position and on the same side of the street.  from their vantage point, the officers had a largely unobstructed, well-lit view of the front area of the building.b.  the defendant arrives.  after approximately twenty minutes of surveillance, torres observed a person, later identified as the defendant, arrive at the front of the building.  the defendant was accompanied by a woman.  the defendant was not previously known to torres and betz.  the defendant and the woman stood on the sidewalk in front of the building.  on several occasions, torres observed the defendant enter the building, remain inside the building and out of view for approximately thirty seconds, and then return to the sidewalk in front of the building.  on at least one of these occasions, the woman accompanied the defendant into the building.  based upon his experience and training, torres knew that it is common practice for persons engaged in street level drug distribution to not have drugs on his person.  instead, some drug purveyors keep drugs nearby in a ""stash"" location and periodically retrieve small quantities of drugs from it to sell, and then return to the stash location to retrieve another small quantity of drugs for the next sale.torres watched people walk in front of the building, passing by the defendant as he stood in front of the building.  he saw the defendant attempt to initiate conversations with some of the pedestrians as they passed him.  on one occasion, torres saw the defendant walk with one of the pedestrians around the corner of fourth street onto division street, where they were out of view for five to ten minutes, and then return to the front of the building.page 498based upon his training and experience, torres knew that it was common practice for drug dealers to consummate a drug transaction on a side street out of view in order to avoid detection.  fourth street is a main street in chelsea, while division street is a side street.c.  the hand-to-hand sale.  after conducting surveillance for approximately twenty to twenty-five minutes, torres saw a man, later identified as james foster, walk by the front of the building, stop, and appear to speak with the defendant.foster was unknown to the police.  from his vantage point, torres could see foster ""manipulating something in his hands"" as he spoke with the defendant.  torres believed that foster's hand movements were consistent with someone counting currency.  the defendant and foster then walked together on fourth street toward the surveillance position and turned right onto division street out of police view.  torres believed that a drug transaction was about to take place.the police officers drove their cruiser on fourth street toward the building, turned left onto division street, and activated their emergency lights.  as they turned onto division street, torres saw the defendant and foster standing face-to-face.  it appeared that the defendant was handing an item to foster, but torres could not see the item.  foster was wearing a hooded sweatshirt with a pouch-like pocket in front that was accessible from the right or left side.  after the interaction between the defendant and foster, torres watched foster put his hands into the sweatshirt pocket.  based upon his experience and training, torres believed that he had witnessed a hand-to-hand drug transaction.  having seen this, the officers drove up to where the defendant and foster were standing and got out of the cruiser.  torres approached foster.  betz approached the defendant.  both officers had their police badges displayed and they identified themselves as police officers.d.  the defendant's arrest.  torres told foster that he was being stopped because the officers believed foster was involved in a drug transaction.  torres told foster to take his hands out of his sweatshirt pocket.  foster hesitated to comply with the order.  foster told torres that he had a knife in his sweatshirt pocket; torres was concerned for his safety.  torres removed the knife from the sweatshirt pocket.  the knife was a folding knife.  uponpage 499removing the knife, torres observed in the pocket a clear plastic knotted bag containing a white powdered substance.  based upon his experience and training, torres believed that the substance was cocaine packaged for street-level distribution.  foster was placed under arrest.during the time that torres spoke with foster, betz and the defendant stood about ten feet away.  after arresting foster, torres approached betz and the defendant.  the defendant was not being compliant with betz's orders.  the defendant appeared to be upset and had taken a ""bladed"" stance toward betz, i.e., a fighting stance.  the defendant was ""pulling away"" from the police, apparently attempting to prevent betz from conducting a search of his person.  the defendant was ""animated"" in his speech and gestures; the officers were concerned for their safety.  the defendant was pat frisked, which revealed nothing of significance.  during a search of the defendant, the officers seized a twenty dollar bill.  the defendant was arrested.e.  booking and strip search.  the defendant was transported to the station house and brought to the booking area.  the officers commenced a routine booking procedure with the defendant.  at some point, the booking procedure was suspended.  the officers believed that the defendant, who had conducted a drug transaction, may have drugs concealed on his person because they had not found any drugs during the search incident to his arrest at the scene.  based upon his experience and training, torres knew that persons engaged in street-level drug transactions commonly hid drugs in their crotch.  the officers decided that a more thorough search of the defendant was necessary, and betz decided to conduct a strip search of the defendant.  the chelsea police department has a written ""strip and body cavity search policy.""  pursuant to that policy, betz advised the defendant that he was going to be subjected to a strip search.  the defendant responded in an ""animated"" manner, telling the police that they were ""not going to do that.""torres and betz escorted the defendant to a cell near the booking area for the purpose of conducting a strip search.  the cell was a private area.  only torres, betz, and the defendant were present during the search.  betz explained the strip search process to the defendant.  the defendant was directed to remove his shirt, pants, underwear, shoes, and socks.  he complied.  torres observed a red bandana in the defendant's crotch area, which was seized.  wrapped inside the bandana were seven small bags which containedpage 500a white powdered substance believed to be cocaine.  the defendant's clothes were returned to him, and the booking procedure was completed.based on this evidence, in a thoughtful memorandum of law, the motion judge determined that the stop, patfrisk, and seizure of money from the defendant, along with his arrest, were lawful.  however, the motion judge concluded that the strip search was not supported by probable cause and was not conducted in accordance with the chelsea police department's written strip search policy.  specifically, the motion judge concluded that ""[t]he mere fact that the police did not find drug contraband on the defendant in their initial search incident to arrest cannot serve, absent other supporting facts not present here, to justify a strip search.""  however, because there are other facts here that support a finding of probable cause, this was error.2.  discussion.  a.  probable cause.  the defendant claims, and the motion judge concluded, that the police lacked probable cause to justify the strip search of the defendant.  we disagree for the following reasons.there is no dispute that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, and to search him incident to that arrest, as they had witnessed him sell cocaine to foster.  indeed, ""[o]nce a custodial arrest occurs, as did here, no additional justification is required for a search of the person for weapons that otherwise might be used to resist arrest or to escape, or to discover evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made.""  commonwealth v. prophete,, 552 (2005).  see g. l. c. 276, § 1.  to lawfully extend an initial search into a strip search,the strip search must be ""justified by probable cause to believe that the defendant had concealed [cocaine] on his person or his clothing that would not otherwise be discovered by the usual search incident to arrest.""  commonwealth v. prophete, supra at 554.  see commonwealth v. thomas,, 408 (1999).  see also cypher, criminal practice and procedure § 5:133, at 450-542 (4th ed. 2014).""probable cause exists where 'the facts and circumstances within . . . [the officers'] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselvespage 501to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that' an offense has been or is being committed.""  commonwealth v. hason,, 174 (1982), quoting from brinegar v. united states, 338 u.s. 160, 175-176 (1949).  see carroll v. united states, 267 u.s. 132, 162 (1925).

they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.""  brinegar v. united states, supra at 175.  see grasso & mcevoy, suppression matters under massachusetts law § 8-1 (2017).probable cause must be determined based on the totality of the circumstances known to the police.  see commonwealth v. prophete, supra at 554-555; commonwealth v. hernandez,, 715 (2007).  the facts and circumstances are to be viewed collectively, not in isolation.  see commonwealth v. santaliz, supra at 241; commonwealth v. lawrence l.,, 823 (2003).several factors and circumstances in this case establish probable cause to believe that the defendant was secreting contraband on his person; as a result, the strip search was justified.  what occurred can be distilled into six salient facts and circumstances:  (1) the police were conducting surveillance in an area known for illegal drug dealing; (2) the defendant's conduct was consistent with someone engaged in street-level drug dealing; (3) the police witnessed the defendant sell cocaine to foster; (4) the defendant attempted to evade, in an animated manner, a search of his person at the scene; (5) based on torres's experience and training, he knew that the crotch area is commonly used by drug dealers to conceal narcotics; and (6) at the police station, when the policepage 502told the defendant they were going to conduct a strip search, the defendant again protested in an animated fashion.based on the salient facts outlined in (1) though (5), there was sufficient reasonably trustworthy information to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that the defendant still had drugs on his person.  see commonwealth v. prophete, 443 mass. at 554-555.  while this defendant did not use his hands to protect the area of his groin,as occurred in prophete, he did attempt to evade, in an animated manner, a search of his person at the scene, although no drugs were then discovered.  this behavior, coupled with the fact that the defendant was selling drugs in a high crime area known for drug dealing, coupled with torres's experience and training regarding dealers secreting drugs in their crotch area, are factual and practical circumstances that could leave a reasonable and prudent person with the belief that the defendant was still concealing drugs on his person.  see brinegar v. united states, supra at 175.this conclusion becomes even more apparent if the salient fact in (6) is added to the probable cause calculus, i.e., when told that he was going to be strip searched, the defendant staged an animated protest in the booking area.while it is, of course, understandable that a person would not relish the indignity of a strip search, the probable cause inquiry does not require the government to exclude other possible explanations for behavior or circumstances that do not equate to probable cause.  see commonwealth v. hason, 387 mass. at 175 (""probable cause does not require a showing that the police resolved all their doubts"").  indeed, even when proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the government is not charged with excluding hypotheses of innocence.  see commonwealth v. merola,, 533-534page 503(1989) (commonwealth ""need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence [to prove its case], provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt"" [quotation omitted]).  put another way, and viewing all the facts and circumstances before the motion judge together, the mere possibility that the defendant may have been innocently motivated in avoiding the strip search does not necessarily mean the police, who are equipped with specialized training and experience, were not justified in believing he was concealing drugs.  see commonwealth v. freeman,, 454 (2015) (""while there could have been an innocent explanation for the events observed by [the detective], he was entitled to view them through the lens of his specialized training and experience and conclude that more than mere coincidence was involved"").  in fact, even if the factors justifying probable cause do not rise to the level of prima facie evidence, see commonwealth v. santaliz, 413 mass. at 241, or even if they turn out to be incorrect, probable cause is not negated.  see commonwealth v. skea,, 701 (1984); grasso & mcevoy, suppression matters under massachusetts law § 8-1.at bottom, the defendant's animated protest to the strip search may properly be considered in gauging whether it was supported by probable cause.  see commonwealth v. battle,, 476 (1974).  see also united states v. mcghee, 627 f.3d 454, 458-459 (1st cir. 2010) (where officers told defendant they were going to complete search of him, and he protested, ""saying that they could not 'stick a finger up [his] ass,'"" this ""pattern of behavior was a reasonable signal that drugs were likely concealed within"").  on this matter, the dissent endeavors to be the legal technicians the probable cause formulation long ago warned against.  see brinegar v. united states, supra at 175.  in fact, the dissent's choice to isolate the possibility that there may be reasons other than guilt to explain the defendant's opposition to the strip search fails to appreciate the flexible, lenient, and common sense approach of the probable cause inquiry.  see texas v. brown, 460 u.s. at 735.there is similarly no merit to the dissent's assertion that because the police lacked probable cause ""at the time"" they told the defendant they were going to conduct the strip search, see post at 513-514, the defendant's protest cannot be used in the probable cause analysis.  even if this were true (and as outlined above, it is not), the fundamental flaw of this assertion is thatpage 504probable cause to support a strip search must objectively exist ""at time the search was made,"" commonwealth v. amado,, 154 (2016), not when the police officers subjectively determined they would conduct one and so informed the defendant.  see 2 lafave, search & seizure § 3.2(d), at 58 and n.104 (5th ed. 2012) (mistake to assert that probable cause must exist ""at the moment the decision is made,"" but rather probable cause is properly determined, based on ""totality of facts"" available to police, ""at the time of the arrest or search"" [quotation omitted]).  see also commonwealth v. alvarado,, 551 (1995) (unnecessary to determine ""at precisely what point the probable cause arose; it is sufficient that it existed at the time that [the officer] conducted his search of [defendant's] person"").  cf. commonwealth v. murdough,, 765 (1999) (""whren v. united states, 517 u.s. 806[, 812] (1996), teaches that, if the objective circumstances justify the action taken, that is enough"").the totality of the circumstances, when viewed collectively, provided sufficient factual and practical considerations, from which a reasonable and prudent person could conclude that the defendant was concealing drugs on his person.page 505b.  strip search policy.  the motion judge also concluded that the strip search of the defendant failed to comply with the chelsea police department's written strip search policy (the policy) because the search was not authorized by the ""officer in charge.""  this was not a ground raised in the defendant's motion to suppress or in his affidavit in support thereof.  see mass.r.crim.p. 13(a)(2), as appearing in  442 mass. 1516  (2004) (""grounds not stated which reasonably could have been known at the time a motion is filed shall be deemed to have been waived"").  although the policy was made an exhibit at the hearing, the defendant did not make the ""officer in charge"" claim until after the evidence was closed, and after the commonwealth could have cured any ambiguity.  despite this, the judge relied on it in his decision, and we will assume the claim is not waived.  see commonwealth v. vargas,, 343 n.6 (2016).the policy does not define the phrase ""officer in charge.""  the evidence at the suppression hearing was that detective torres and lieutenant betz did not together make the decision to conduct a strip search, because the decision was for betz alone to make.  later, torres clarified that because betz was torres's ""commanding officer,"" betz made ""the final decision to authorize the strip search.""  although the judge concluded that the strip search was not authorized by the ""officer in charge,"" he did not do so by finding that a ""commanding officer"" does not qualify as an ""officer in charge.""  rather, he mistakenly stated that there was no testimony supporting the conclusion that betz was the commanding officer, which is clearly erroneous.see commonwealth v. castillo,, 781 (2016).  thus, the procedure torres followed prior to the strip search conformed to the policy'spage 506requirement for an arresting officer to receive prior approval from a commanding officer.however, even if betz's prior approval as the commanding officer did not satisfy the policy's dictates, neither the supreme judicial court nor this court has required adherence to such a policy to find a strip search justifiable.  commonwealth v. vick, 90 mass. app. ct. at 631 n.15.  indeed, not adhering to such a policy is not determinative of the reasonableness of a search; it is only one factor in the analysis.  see commonwealth v. morales,, 343 n.9 (2012); commonwealth v. vick, supra at 631.instead, the reasonableness of a strip search is assessed by a variety of factors, such as privacy in the place where the search is conducted, minimizing the number of persons present during the search, and having a person of the same gender as the defendant conduct the search; each case is to be judged on its own facts.  see commonwealth v. morales, supra at 342-343 and cases cited.  here, it is important to note that the defendant has not claimed that the manner or place in which the strip search was conducted was unreasonable, and the judge did not so find.  rather, the judge found that the strip search was conducted by torres and betz (two male officers) in a private cell near the booking area.  betz explained the process to the defendant, who was directed to remove his clothing, and he complied.  when the red bandana concealing the seven bags of cocaine was revealed, it was seized, whereupon the defendant's clothes were returned to him.in view of the above factors, this strip search was conducted in a reasonable and respectful manner, which outweighed the lack of prior approval by the officer in charge, to the extent that that occurred at all.  see commonwealth v. vick, supra at 632.  in this posture, there is no occasion to apply the exclusionary rule.  see commonwealth v. wilkerson,, 142 (2002) (because police officers ""did nothing wrong, there is no unlawful conduct for exclusion of the evidence to deter"").3.  conclusion.  as the strip search was supported by probable cause and conducted reasonably, it was error to suppress the fruits of that search.  we reverse so much of the order allowing the motion to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of the strip search.so ordered.page 507today's decision blurs the distinction between probable cause to search (which was present here) and probable cause to conduct a strip search (which was not), and dispenses with the need for the type of specific, particularized probable cause to conduct a strip search required since commonwealth v. thomas,, 408-409 & n.5 (1999).  for this reason, i respectfully dissent.the supreme judicial court has held that ""the search of the defendant lawfully could progressively extend into a strip (or a visual body cavity) search only if such a search was justified by probable cause to believe that the defendant had concealed [drugs] on his person or his clothing that would not otherwise be discovered by the usual search incident to arrest.""  commonwealth v. prophete,, 554 (2005).  in so holding, the court departed from federal cases, and instead required that a strip search be based on probable cause to believe that drugs, weapons, or contraband were hidden in such a way that a more intrusive search was justified.  see id. at 553-554, citing bell v. wolfish, 441 u.s. 520, 559 (1979).on the facts found by the motion judge, the evidence here was insufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant had secreted drugs in such a way as to necessitate a strip search.  because the police lacked probable cause to believe that they would find contraband in the private areas of his body, they lacked a lawful basis to conduct a strip search, that is a search which requires ""the arrested person to discard all of his or her clothing,"" commonwealth v. prophete, supra at 556, or in which the ""last layer of clothing is moved . . . in such a manner whereby an intimate area of the detainee is viewed, exposed, or displayed.""  commonwealth v. morales,, 342 (2012).these are the relevant facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented by undisputed facts that he implicitly credited, and that are consistent with his ruling.  see commonwealth v. jones-pannell,, 431 (2015); commonwealth v. depiero,, 452 n.3 (2016).we repeat them here because fealty to the supported findings is central to the case.on march 25, 2016, at approximately 9:00 p.m., officer jose torres, jr. and lieutenant betz of the chelsea police department drug unit were conducting surveillance near the bellinghampage 508square area of chelsea.  the officers had received citizen complaints of illegal drug activity and prostitution in the general area of their surveillance position.  the officers focused on a multifamily residential building located at 9-ll fourth street (building).after twenty minutes, torres saw the defendant, whom he did not know, arrive at the front of the building with a woman.  on three to five occasions, torres saw the defendant go into the building, remain inside the building and out of view for thirty seconds, and then ""take a short walk"" of five or ten minutes duration.  he then returned and went into the building again.  torres testified that it is ""common practice for street-level dealers to retrieve the item that they're looking to sell, the narcotics, and make that [sale] and then return back to the stash location . . . and re-up.""the judge credited this testimony explicitly, stating that torres was ""aware that it is common practice for persons engaged in street level drug distribution to not have a drug stash on their person, but to retrieve a small quantity of drugs from a stash location, sell the drugs, and then return to the stash location to retrieve another small quantity of drugs to sell.""consistent with commonwealth v. jones-pannell, supra, we treat this as the judge's finding on this issue.after twenty-five minutes of surveillance, torres saw a pedestrian, later identified as james foster, speaking with the defendant in front of the building.  as set forth in the majority opinion, the police observed what they believed to be a hand-to-hand drug transaction, leading to foster's arrest and the discovery of drugs in the pocket of foster's sweatshirt.after placing foster under arrest, torres approached betz and the defendant.  the defendant was upset, animated in his speech and gestures, and did not comply with betz's orders.  he took a ""bladed"" stance, which the judge found to be a ""fighting"" stance.  the defendant pulled away from the officers in an ""apparent[] attempt[]"" to prevent betz from searching him.  the officers eventually conducted a search of the defendant and found nopage 509weapons or drugs, but did discover a twenty dollar bill, a dollar value consistent with the amount of cocaine discovered on foster.  the defendant was placed under arrest and transported to the police station.during booking, the officers decided that a more thorough search of the defendant was necessary to determine if he had concealed drugs on his person.  this decision was based on the fact that they had not found drugs during the search, and torres's belief that the groin area was a common place for dealers to hide their contraband to avoid detection from law enforcement.betz informed the defendant that he was going to be strip searched.  in response, the defendant became animated and stated that the officers were ""not going to do that.""torres and betz brought the defendant to a private cell and explained the strip search process.  the defendant complied with the command to remove his shirt, pants, underwear, socks, and shoes.  the officers saw a red bandana in the defendant's crotch area.  upon inspection of the red bandana, the officers discovered seven small bags containing a white powdered substance believed to be cocaine.the motion judge concluded that the fact that the police did not find drugs on the defendant during the initial search was not, ""absent other supporting facts not present here,"" sufficient to justify the strip search.discussion.  in reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, we must accept the motion judge's ""subsidiary findings absent clear error but conduct an independent review of the ultimate findings and conclusions of law.""  commonwealth v. jones-pannell, 472 mass. at 431 (quotation omitted).  inferences to be drawn from the testimony, the weight of the evidence, and questions of credibility are for the motion judge, not an appellate court.  see id. at 431-432 & n.3; commonwealth v. tremblay,, 297 n.3 (2017).""[s]trip or bodily cavity searches, by their very nature, are humiliating, demeaning, and terrifying experiences that, without question, constitute a substantial intrusion on one's personal privacy rights.""  commonwealth v. prophete, 443 mass. at 553, citing commonwealth v. thomas, 429 mass. at 408-409 & n.5.  for this reason, to conduct a strip search in the commonwealth, the ""police must have probable cause to believe that 'they willpage 510find a weapon, contraband, or the fruits or instrumentalities of criminal activity that they could not reasonably expect to discover'"" without removing all clothing or exposing intimate areas of the defendant's body.  commonwealth v. vick,, 628 (2016), quoting from commonwealth v. prophete, 443 mass. at 556.see commonwealth v.  morales, 462 mass. at 342.this means that the officers had to have probable cause to believe that the defendant was hiding drugs in the intimate areas of his body, and that moving or removing all his clothes would be necessary to find them.  however, such probable cause is lacking here.  the police did not report feeling any object near the defendant's groin or buttocks.  contrast commonwealth v. clermy,, 327 (1995) (officer felt hard object in genital area during patfrisk and retrieved object); commonwealth v. amado,, 158 (2016) (gants, c.j., dissenting) (officer ""felt a hard object behind the defendant's testicles"" that ""was not 'part of the male anatomy'"").  the motion judge made no finding that the defendant was reaching toward, reaching into, shielding, or attempting to shield his groin area or buttocks, although the commonwealth argued for such a finding.  contrast commonwealth v. prophete, supra at 554-555 (""defendant, twice, used his hands to protect the area around his groin during the officers' initial pat-down search""); commonwealth v. vick, supra at 624 (defendant attempted to reach his cuffed hands toward his buttocks and thereafter, officer, while performing search incident to arrest, felt hard object in cleft of defendant's buttocks).the prosecutor expressly urged the motion judge to make a finding that the defendant was shielding his groin area.  the commonwealth relied on torres's testimony that he thought the defendant's ""crotch area"" warranted further attention because the defendant distanced himself and took a bladed stance before the patfrisk was conducted.however, when asked by the prosecutor what distancing meant, torres answered that the defendant waspage 511distancing his whole body, not any particular area of the body.the motion judge's decision not to make a factual finding that the defendant was shielding his groin area was supported by the record, and was not the product of inadvertence or oversight.  it is not for us to supplement that determination with a contrary finding.  commonwealth v. jones-pannell, 472 mass. at 432 (""the commonwealth essentially asks us to do what our case law proscribes:  to rely on testimony that was neither explicitly nor implicitly credited by the motion judge, otherwise put, that we in essence make additional findings, and reach a different result, based on our own view of the evidence"").the commonwealth has not cited, and we have not found, a massachusetts case validating a strip search in the absence of some evidence that the contraband was hidden in a private area of the defendant's body.  as just discussed, the police did not feel any object near, and did not see the defendant reach toward, his groin area.  nor was there any evidence that the defendant stayed on the street after making sales, thus permitting an inference that he had concealed drugs on his body.  contrast commonwealth v. thomas, 429 mass. at 408 (""it was . . . reasonable for the police to believe that . . . because he remained on the street with the woman, . . . he had more hidden drugs"").  even federal cases that apply a far more lenient ""particularized suspicion"" standard, have found strip searches unlawful absent some particularized showing that the drugs were actually hidden on the defendant's body.  see, e.g., united states v. barnes, 506 f.3d 58, 62 (1st cir. 2007).in this case, a finding of probable cause must rest, then, on an assessment of four remaining factors:  (1) the defendant took a fighting stance and was pulling away as if to avoid the patfrisk; (2) the defendant had previously gone inside the building topage 512""re-up""; (3) torres's testimony that drug dealers frequently hide drugs in the groin area; and (4) the defendant's resistance to being strip searched at the police station.we recognize that ""probable cause . . . deal[s] with probabilities.  these are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.""  commonwealth v. prophete, 443 mass. at 555, quoting from draper v. united states, 358 u.s. 307, 313 (1959).  the first three factors were sufficient to demonstrate probable cause to conduct the patfrisk and search.  however, none of the first three factors, either alone or in combination, suffice to establish probable cause to conduct a strip search of this defendant.  the commonwealth's argument in this respect ignores the fact that the judge credited torres's testimony that the defendant consistently returned to the building for thirty seconds at a time, in order ""to not have a drug stash on [his] person.""  nor did the cash found on the defendant indicate anything more than a single sale of the amount of drugs found on foster.torres's general knowledge that some drug dealers ""jock"" drugs is insufficient to establish a particularized suspicion, much less probable cause, to believe that this defendant was doing so.  see commonwealth v. amado, 474 mass. at 149 (""'jocking' refers to a suspect's attempt to hide narcotics in the buttocks area"").  ""the evidence . . . that [the defendant] was a suspected drug dealer in possession of narcotics and that some drug dealers conceal drugs between their buttocks -- did not endow [the officer] with an individualized suspicion that [the defendant] was 'cheeking' drugs.""  united states v. barnes, 506 f.3d at 62 (invalidating body cavity search).  if a generalized suspicion that a drug dealer may be carrying drugs in his groin or buttocks is enough to justify a strip search, then a strip search would be justified in virtually all drug arrests, and ""our long-standing jurisprudence"" requiring particularized probable cause ""will be seriously undermined.""  commonwealth v. warren,, 539 (2016).the majority attempts to bridge this evidentiary gap in three ways.  first, it relies on the evidence that a drug deal took place.  that evidence is relevant to the propriety of the search incident to arrest, but says nothing about whether there were drugs on thepage 513defendant's person requiring the removal of the defendant's clothing.second, the majority also states that the judge's findings about the defendant returning to the building are unsupported, speculating instead that ""it is also just as likely that the defendant held more drugs on his person for each sale.""  ante at 504 n.7.  the evidence in the record on this point was to the contrary.  unlike the defendant in commonwealth v. thomas, 429 mass. at 408, this defendant ""re-up[ped]"" after each ""walk.""  the motion judge credited torres's testimony explicitly and found that the defendant was going in the building to re-up for the express purpose of ensuring that there were no drugs on his person in the event of arrest.  although the motion judge did not explicitly say ""and i so find"" following his summary of torres's testimony, he was not required to do so once he stated that he credited torres's testimony.  see commonwealth v. jones-pannell, 472 mass. at 431-432.  indeed, once the motion judge credited this testimony, and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, there is no other way to interpret his ruling.  torres did testify that some drug dealers jock drugs, but the motion judge specifically credited the testimony that this dealer did not, and, in fact, returned to the building to re-up.  whether there was probable cause to believe that the defendant was hiding drugs on his body ""depends on specific facts found by the judge that underlie such a determination.""  commonwealth v. jones-pannell, supra at 434.  it was for the motion judge to weigh the evidence and make findings.  the motion judge's findings binds us.third, the majority relies on the defendant's protest of the strip search, asserting that this protest, together with all the other facts and circumstances, provides a substantial basis for a finding of probable cause as a matter of law.  the defendant's statement that the officers ""were not going to do that"" was offered to show consciousness of guilt.this evidence may not be relied upon to tip the scales in favor of probable cause, however.  at the time thatpage 514the officers told the defendant that they would strip search him, they lacked probable cause to do so.  the defendant's protest of a search without probable cause cannot create probable cause for a search.  ""were the rule otherwise, the police could turn a hunch into [probable cause] by inducing the conduct justifying the [search].""  commonwealth v. thibeau,, 764 (1981).  see commonwealth v. stoute,, 789 (1996).  this is not a ""legal technician's"" sleight of hand.  it is bedrock constitutional law.  where, as here, the police lacked a lawful basis to demand the strip search, the defendant's protest should not be treated as consciousness of guilt in assessing the probable cause calculus.  see thibeau, supra.a generalized suspicion that drug dealers may jock drugs, coupled with the protest of an unlawful demand for an unconstitutional search, do not probable cause make.  accordingly, i respectfully dissent.",criminal,0.0,0.0
1676,guiseppe balistreri  vs.  janine m. balistreri.,"divorce and separation, alimony.  evidence, conversation between husband and wife.this court concluded that where, in a divorce action, there are one or more predivorce-judgment complaints (whether for support, modification, or divorce) that result in a judgment of spousal support, the judge has the discretion, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, to determine which pleading is to be used to calculate the length of a marriage within the meaning of g. l. c. 208, § 48; therefore, a probate and family court judge did not abuse her discretion in choosing as the appropriate pleading event a 2008 complaint for modification that resulted in a judgment awarding spousal support, rather than the 2011 complaint for divorce upon which the judgment of divorce (including an award of alimony) entered, but the judge should have used the date of service of the complaint for modification to calculate the length of the marriage. [518-522]in a proceeding on a complaint for divorce, no error arose from the probate and family court judge's declining, on the basis of spousal disqualification, to permit the wife to testify to conversations she had had with the husband, where, under common law, the marriage was not over at the time of those conversations. [522]","the alimony reform act defines ""length of the marriage"" as the ""number of months from the date of legal marriage to the date of service of a complaint or petition for divorce or separate support.""  g. l. c. 208, § 48, inserted by st. 2011, c. 124, § 3.  at issue is how to apply this language where there are multiple support complaints (none resulting in a spousal support judgment), a predivorce complaint for modification that led to apage 516spousal support judgment, a divorce complaint that did not lead to judgment, and a divorce complaint upon which judgment entered awarding alimony.  we hold that, where there are one or more predivorce-judgment complaints (whether for support, modification, or divorce) that result in a judgment of spousal support, it lies within the judge's discretion -- taking into account the totality of the circumstances -- to determine which of these pleadings is to be used to calculate the length of a marriage for purposes of the alimony reform act (act or alimony reform act).background.  the parties had a child in 1994 and were married on march 26, 1995.  from october 1996 through april 2000, the wife filed two complaints for supportand a complaint for divorce.the details of these various complaints are set out in the margin; of importance for our purposes here is that none of them led to a judgment.on january 11, 2005, the wife filed a complaintfor separate support that, based on the parties' agreement, led to a judgment requiring the husband to pay $400 each week in child support.  nopage 517spousal support was awarded or agreed to.on june 11, 2008, the wife filed a complaint for modification,seeking to modify the 2005 support judgment to require the husband to cover health costs for her and the child, and to pay spousal support.on july 31, 2009, a partial modification judgment entered in accordance with the parties' agreement with respect to all issues except spousal support.because there was no agreement with respect to spousal support, the judge bifurcated that issue and scheduled it for trial.after trial, the judge entered a supplemental judgment of modification which (1) restated the husband's existing child support obligation of $400 weekly, and (2) required the husband to pay $273.25 weekly to the wife as alimony until (a) the death of either party, (b) the wife's remarriage, (c) entry of an inconsistent divorce judgment, or (d) modification of the judgment.on april 14, 2011, the husband filed a complaint for divorce pursuant to g. l. c. 208, § 1b, citing an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.  judgment on this complaint entered on april 6, 2014,awarding the wife $298 weekly in alimony to terminate either in seventy months, or upon her remarriage, or either party's death.  the wife appealed.on appeal, a panel of this court vacated the alimony award because it was unclear whether the judge had intended to calculate the duration of the marriage by using the service date of the 2005 support complaint or of the 2011 divorce complaint, and remanded the case for reconsideration of that issue.  we otherwise affirmed the judgment.  see balistreri v. balistreri, 89 mass. app. ct. 1106 (2016).page 518the court held a trial on the issue remanded as well as additional matters not pertinent to this appeal.as relevant for our purposes here, the judge found that the parties did not ""continue[] to have a relationship"" after february 2, 2005 -- the date on which child support was first ordered.  for this reason, the judge found ""it is appropriate that the length of the marriage be determined from the date of the service of the [c]omplaint"" that led to that award of child support.the judge did not have the benefit of sbrogna v. sbrogna,(2018), at the time of her decision.discussion.  the alimony reform act limits the duration of general alimony by pegging it to the ""length of the marriage,"" g. l. c. 208, § 49(b), a phrase defined as ""the number of months from the date of legal marriage to the date of service of a complaint or petition for divorce or separate support.""  g. l. c. 208, § 48.  this language is in the disjunctive, see miller v. miller,, 329 (2007) (""it is fundamental to statutory construction that the word 'or' is disjunctive . . ."" [citation omitted]), meaning that either a qualifying support complaint or a qualifying divorce pleading may serve as the terminal event for purposes of the § 48 definition.  the definition places both types of pleadings (divorce and support) on equal footing for its purposes; neither is given priority or additional weight, whether by virtue of earlier service, filing, or otherwise.  see chin v. merriot,, 537 (2015), quoting from commissioner of correction v. superior ct. dept. of the trial ct. for the county of worcester,, 126 (2006) (court will not ""read into the statute a provision which the legislature did not see fit to put there"").  thus, assuming that more than one particular pleading qualifies for inclusion, the legislature has chosen to allow each of them to be considered for purposes of § 48.  this straightforward reading of the statutory language, however, begs two questions.  the first is which pleadings qualify to be considered.  the second is how to choose among competing qualifying pleadings.page 519we reached a partial answer to the first question in sbrogna.  in that case, the husband filed a divorce complaint under g. l. c. 208, § 1b, that ultimately became inactive and upon which judgment never entered.  later, the parties filed a joint divorce petition under g. l. c. 208, § 1a, that led to a divorce judgment awarding alimony.  on those facts, we held that the legally relevant divorce pleading for purposes of calculating the ""length of the marriage"" under g. l. c. 208, § 48, was the one upon which the divorce judgment entered.sbrogna, 92 mass. app. ct. at 643.  we stated that ""[t]o read the statute otherwise would lead to the nonsensical result that service of a pleading that leads neither to a valid divorcecould nonetheless serve as the basis for calculating the length of a marriage and the duration of alimony, even if the parties reconciled and lived together for decades before ultimately divorcing"" (emphasis supplied).  id. at 642.  although sbrogna involved only divorce pleadings, we see no reason why its reasoning should not apply with equal force to support complaints.  thus, we conclude that a support complaint that results in a judgment awarding spousal support qualifies to be considered for purposes of § 48, but that a support complaint that does not result in such a judgment does not.our conclusion that the legislature's reference in § 48 to a ""support complaint"" encompasses only those resulting in a judgment awarding spousal support (as opposed to support judgments awarding other forms of relief, such as child support or health care costs) is buttressed by the over-all purpose and reach of the alimony reform act.  see chin, supra (court will not read provisions into statute).  the act is limited to alimony, its provisions do not have ""general or unlimited application outside the arena of alimony,"" and the definitions contained in § 48 do not apply outside of §§ 49 through 55 of the act.page 520valaskatgis v. valaskatgis,, 757 (2015).  the act is not concerned, for example, with the division of marital assets, id. at 758, quoting from kittredge v. kittredge,, 43 (2004) (definitions of § 48 do not restrain judge's broad discretion to ""weigh[] and balanc[e] . . . the § 34 factors, and the resulting equitable division of the parties' marital property""), nor does it provide for child support.  there is simply no indication that the legislature intended to include within the definition of § 48 complaints that do not result in spousal support judgments.  nor would it make any sense to read the statute to encompass such complaints; otherwise, an award of temporary child support or health care under g. l. c. 208, § 19 (which is outside the alimony reform act) could, for example, inexplicably and illogically reduce the duration of alimony awarded at the time of divorce.  since even temporary alimony awards under g. l. c. 208, § 17, do not reduce the presumptive maximum duration of alimony under the act, see holmes v. holmes,, 659 (2014), there is even less reason for other types of support judgments to do so.before proceeding further, we pause to apply the principles we have set out above to the various pleadings that were filed in this case.  the husband's april 14, 2011 divorce complaint is the pleading upon which the divorce judgment (including an alimony award) entered.  it therefore qualified to be considered as the terminal date of the ""length of the marriage"" for purposes of § 48.  the wife's january 11, 2005 separate support complaint led only to a judgment ordering child support.  that complaint, therefore, cannot serve as a terminal date of the ""length of the marriage"" for purposes of § 48.  by contrast, the wife's june 11, 2008 complaint for modification resulted in a judgment awarding spousal support.  although we acknowledge that § 48 does not refer to modification complaints, we conclude from the over-all structure and intent of the section and of the alimony reform act as a whole, see zaleski v. zaleski,, 239-240 (2014), that a predivorce-judgment complaint for modification that results in an award of spousal support can qualify as the terminal date for the length of the marriage under § 48.  cf. flor v. flor,, 366 (2017) (alimony award made on postdivorce modification complaint related back to divorce judgment becausepage 521parties' separation agreement reserved right to future alimony).  thus, there were two qualifying complaints the judge could consider for purposes of § 48:  the husband's april 14, 2011 divorce complaint, and the wife's june 11, 2008 complaint for modification.where, as here, there is more than one qualifying pleading, it is within the judge's discretion to determine -- taking into account the totality of the circumstances -- which of them should be used to calculate the length of the marriage for purposes of § 48.  see g. l. c. 208, § 48 (judge has discretion to increase length of marriage where marital partnership began during period of cohabitation).  see also g. l. c. 208, § 53(a) (in determining appropriate duration of alimony, judge may consider other factors that are ""relevant and material""); holmes, supra at 660 (judge has discretion to reduce duration of alimony below presumptive maximum where temporary alimony has been paid for unusually long period of time or recipient spouse has unfairly delayed final resolution); duff-kareores v. kareores,, 538 (2016) (judge retains discretion under § 48 for period of premarital cohabitation).  as noted above, the statute itself does not give any priority or weight to one particular qualifying pleading or the other; thus, although the temporal sequence of the pleadings may be considered as a factor, it is not necessarily dispositive.  instead, the judge should consider the totality of the circumstances to determine which is the appropriate pleading to use.in other circumstances, we would remand to allow the judge to exercise discretion in the first instance as to which of the two qualifying pleadings in this case to use as the terminal date for purposes of § 48.  here, however, we already have the judge's detailed findings after trial, which included an explicit finding that she did not credit the wife's testimony that the parties lived together after 2005, and also her ultimate discretionary assessment not to use the divorce complaint as the terminal date of the marriage for purposes of § 48.  we see no abuse of discretion in the judge's rejection of the divorce complaint as the appropriate event, and therefore there is no cause for remand.  that said, for the reasons set out above, it is the service date of the complaint for modification -- not the service date of the complaint for support -- that should have been used to calculate the length of the marriage, resulting in a marriage of 159 months, and a presumptive duration of alimony of 111 months under g. l.page 522c. 208, § 49(b)(3).we briefly address the wife's remaining argumentthat her constitutional due process rights were violated when the judge, on the basis of spousal disqualification, did not permit her to testify to conversations she had with the husband after 2009.  see mass. g. evid. § 504(b)(1) (2018).  in essence, her argument is that no spousal disqualification could exist after the terminal date of the marriage under § 48.  however, as we have previously held, ""the § 48 definition of 'length of the marriage' applies only when the phrase appears"" in the provisions of the alimony reform act.  valaskatgis, 87 mass. app. ct. at 757.  for all other purposes, the common-law rule remains that a marriage is not over until the divorce judgment becomes absolute.  see ross v. ross,, 35 (1982); sbrogna, 92 mass. app. ct. at 642.

[530-532]in a land court action that was brought seeking enforcement of certain restrictions on the use of the defendant's land, reversal was required of the judge's finding that the defendant was in contempt of a preliminary injunction based on the defendant's having allowed a separate entity to hold an event on its land before the defendant was a party to the case, where there was no finding of concerted activity by the defendant, which was a nonpartypage 524at the time, i.e., the defendant was not in privity with the parties against whom the injunctive relief was granted to be bound by those orders for contempt purposes [532-533]; and where the judge clearly erred in finding that judicial estoppel required the defendant to obey the preliminary injunction, in that this court on the entire evidence was left with the definite and firm conviction that the defendant had not agreed to be bound by the judge's prior interpretations of the restrictions, and accordingly the contempt finding was not supported by clear and convincing evidence of disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command. [533-536]","the defendants boston boat basin, llc, owner of an inn and marina on boston harbor, and its manager (together, boston boat), appeal from a land court judgment ordering boston boat to comply with certain property use restrictions -- agreed to by one of boston boat's predecessors in title -- that benefit an abutter, plaintiff commercial wharf east condominium association (cweca).  on appeal, boston boat presses its attempt to cast off these restrictions on the ground that they impermissibly ""limit the use of [its] marina and inn almost exclusively to private clients"" and ""restrict the public's ability to enjoy boston harbor.""  boston boat claims that the restrictions thus violate the public trust doctrine, which, in general terms, protects public rights in

properly relinquished.see arno v. commonwealth,, 436, 455-456 (2010).  boston boat also appeals from the judge's finding that it was in contempt of a preliminary injunction earlier obtained by cweca to enforce the restrictions against a predecessor in title.page 525we affirm the judgment requiring compliance with the restrictions as the judge interpreted them.  we conclude, however, that the preliminary injunction did not apply to boston boat.  therefore, the contempt finding cannot stand.background.  we draw our description of the case largely from the judge's detailed decision.  except as to the contempt claim, the pertinent facts are undisputed.1.  prior proceedings.  boston boat owns and operates an inn and marina (the locus), known as boston yacht haven, at the seaward end of commercial wharf on boston harbor, on or over commonwealth tidelands.  see note 2, supra.  boston boat holds a license under g. l. c. 91, the waterways act administered by the department of environmental protection (the department), to use the locus.  the sole land access is by easement over the property of cweca, an association of owners of certain condominiums located at the landward end of the wharf.in 2006, cweca filed this suit against the locus's prior owner of record and its affiliates (the prior owners) to enforce certain restrictions on the use of the locus.  cweca obtained a preliminary injunction requiring the prior owners to comply with those restrictions as the judge interpreted them.in 2009, cweca obtained a partial summary judgment ruling that rejected the prior owners' claim that the restrictions violated the public trust doctrine, and reiterated the proper interpretation of the restrictions, leaving the issue of damages for trial.  also in 2009, the prior owner of record filed for bankruptcy, and the mortgagee bank foreclosed.  the purchaser at the foreclosure auction sold the locus to boston boat in 2010.after some inconclusive procedural skirmishing over whether boston boat should be made a defendant in this action, cweca filed in july of 2011 a contempt complaint asserting that boston boat was using the locus in violation of the 2006 preliminary injunction.  that injunction remained in effect but had not been made permanent.  cweca subsequently amended its underlyingpage 526complaint to add boston boat as a party and to seek declaratory and injunctive relief against boston boat regarding the validity and interpretation of the restrictions.  in december of 2011, the judge held a trial on both the underlying and contempt complaints.  only cweca and boston boat (and not the prior owners) participated in the trial.in december of 2016, the judge issued a decision(1) rejecting boston boat's claim that the restrictions interfered with public trust rights and (2) finding boston boat in contempt of the 2006 preliminary injunction.  the resulting judgment required boston boat to comply with the restrictions, as the judge interpreted them, and which we now describe.2.  the restrictions.  the restrictions on boston boat's use of the locus stem from three sources:  conditions on an access easement;a zoning variance and permit limiting the number of parking spaces at the locus;and, most significantly, a 2003 settlement agreement between cweca and one of boston boat's predecessors in title, the developer of the locus (the 2003 agreement).the 2003 agreement, which resolved a suit by cweca against the developer, encumbered and ran with the locus for the benefit of cweca and was duly recorded.  as summarized and interpreted by the judge, the agreement included restrictions that:""(1) regulate deliveries and parking at the [i]nn [and] [m]arina, (2) prohibit its use by ferries, party, cruise, charter, or excursion boats, boats that sell alcoholic beverages, and boatspage 527that permit or provide gambling or gaming activities except for private, social games with no more than six participants, (3) prohibit its use as a 'function hall,' and (4) prohibit its use for 'social events, such as, but not limited to, weddings, bar mitzvahs, school dances or holiday parties,' except for up to four 'special events' per year, open only to 'privately invited guests or narrowly targeted audiences,' for which [cweca] must be given at least thirty-days prior notice.""these are the restrictions that boston boat sought to void as inconsistent with the public trust doctrine.3.  the c. 91 license.  in 1997, the department issued to the developer a thirty-year c. 91 license for the locus.  boston boat succeeded to that license in 2010.the license authorized construction and maintenance of a pier, marina service building, and float system, with such structures to ""be limited to the following uses:  to provide a public recreational boating facility; public access to navigable waters; and accessory uses to the marina including a restaurant primarily serving marina patrons, a marine chandlery, office, crew quarters, vehicular circulation and parking.""  notably, the license contained a ""special condition"" that provided in pertinent part:""in partial compensation for the private use of structures on commonwealth tidelands, which interferes with the rights of the public to use such lands, the [l]icensee shall allow the public to pass on foot, for any purpose and for 24 hours per day, on the proposed pier . . . .  to the extent that the [l]icensee has the right to allow the public to pass across commercial wharf to its proposed pier pursuant to the [easement], the [l]icensee shall allow the public such a right of passage. . . .  in no event shall the [d]epartment require the [l]icensee to provide access across commercial wharf if the licensee does not have the legal right to provide such access.""the license also included numerous ""standard"" conditions, many of them also imposed by c. 91 itself, including provisions (1) confirming the department's authority to control changes in thepage 528use of the licensed locus;(2) describing generally the nature of the public rights protected;and (3) disclaiming any intent to infringe on the rights of property owners other than the licensee.discussion.  1.  authority to enforce public trust rights.  we now come to boston boat's claim that the restrictions agreed to by its predecessors in title unduly restrict public access to and use of its waterfront locus, and therefore violate the public trust doctrine and are void.  the judge, seeing no such impact on public rights, rejected this claim.  we likewise reject it, but on a different ground:  boston boat had no authority in the first place to seek judicial enforcement of public trust rights in this private litigation.""only the commonwealth, 'or an entity to which the legislature has delegated authority expressly, may act to further public trust rights.'""  moot v. department of envtl. protection,, 347 (2007) (moot i),

""[i]t is not [the court's] role to determine whether the proposed . . . project meets that statutory requirement.""id. at 350-351.page 530and in arno, the court held that the attorney general and the land court had no authority to relinquish public trust rights through land registration proceedings.  arno, 457 mass. at 451-453.  although the attorney general had ""expressly waived any such rights"" in a certain parcel during 1922 registration proceedings, id. at 436, the waiver was invalid, because the land registration statutes did not ""contain[] an express delegation, to the land court or to the attorney general, of the legislature's power to relinquish the public's rights in tidelands.""  id. at 451.here, boston boat purports to seek to enforce public trust rights, by asking the land court to invalidate use restrictions (agreed to by a predecessor in title) that assertedly infringe on such rights.  but boston boat is not ""an entity to which the legislature has delegated authority expressly . . . to further public trust rights.'""  moot i, 448 mass. at 347, quoting from fafard, 432 mass. at 197.  nor does boston boat point to any statute authorizing the land court, in a suit between private parties to enforce property use restrictions, to invalidate such restrictions as inconsistent with public trust rights.  given the supreme judicial court's consistent and strict enforcement of the express delegation requirement, we reject the argument that the proper extent of public trust rights in a particular locus may be determined in private litigation such as the present case.in light of the department's preeminent responsibility in enforcing public trust rights through the c. 91 licensing process, the department is in the best position to assess claims such as boston boat's.  as should be evident from our summary, supra, of some of the relevant conditions of boston boat's c. 91 license, the department has already considered, at least as a general matter, not only the proper balance between, but also the possibility of conflicts between, private rights and public trust rights.  the license authorizes boston boat to make specified uses of structures on commonwealth tidelands, including ""a public recreationalpage 531boating facility"" and ""public access to navigable waters"" as well as ""accessory uses to the marina including a restaurant primarily serving marina patrons, a marine chandlery, office, crew quarters, vehicular circulation and parking.""  the license recognizes that boston boat will make some ""private use"" of the locus, and that in ""partial compensation"" therefor, boston boat must allow public access on foot to its pier, unless it is determined that boston boat ""does not have the legal right to provide such access.""plainly, the license does not invalidate every restriction that might somehow diminish the public's ability to use the locus, as boston boat seems to contend.  rather, licensure reflects a balance; it requires the department to determine that the pier and other structures on the locus ""serve a proper public purpose and that said purpose shall provide a greater public benefit than public detriment to the rights of the public in said lands.""  g. l. c. 91, § 14, as amended by st. 1983,    c. 589, § 24;

in response, boston boat offered to submit a supplemental affidavit of its manager, agreeing to abide by those interpretations.  the judge, seeking a more definitive end to the litigation, asked if boston boat would file a stipulation and agreement to judgment to that effect.  boston boat declined to do so, expressing its opposition to becoming a party.  the judge then stated his inclination to allow boston boat to be substituted as a defendant -- so as to ""end this once and for all with a judgment that everybody recognizes as binding on the wharf"" -- but asked boston boat and cweca to try to agree on the terms of such a judgment.at the september 8, 2010, hearing, the parties reported their inability to agree.  the judge then noted boston boat's earlier statement that it was ""willing to live with the restrictions,"" but observed that boston boat ""may have hedged a bit"" on whether it also agreed to abide by ""[his] interpretation of the restrictions"" and asked boston boat to clarify its position.  in response, boston boat reiterated that it was aware of ""the restrictions"" and had no intent to violate them, but that, given the judge's expressed inclination ""to substitute boston boat into the case over [its] objection,"" boston boat would not simply agree to ""a substitution and then an entry of judgment.""  boston boat was ""not prepared to waive any rights to litigation[,] appeal or otherwise to lodge some valid objection or motion to the enforceability of those restrictions as they sit.""  the judge asked whether boston boat was seeking to preserve its appellate rights; boston boat replied that it would not waive ""any rights, including [its] appellate rights,"" and that, ""since it sounds like boston boat is coming into this case, [it] would like the opportunity to take part in some of the litigation that was missed in the last four years.""  the judge then took the motion to substitute under advisement.page 535ten months later, cweca filed its contempt complaint, asserting that boston boat was using the locus in violation of the 2006 preliminary injunction.  the judge then issued an order stating that boston boat was not a party to this action, and that the motion to substitute boston boat as a defendant remained under advisement, but that in the meantime cweca should move to amend its underlying complaint to add boston boat as a defendant.  cweca filed such a motion, which the judge allowed over boston boat's objection, and the 2011 trial on the underlying and contempt complaints ensued.the judge's decision found with respect to judicial estoppel that boston boat had ""stipulated that [it] would abide by the restrictions"" (emphasis added), citing the transcript of the july 23, 2010, hearing.  the judge appears to have overlooked the later hearing of september 8, 2010, at which he himself had expressed uncertainty over whether boston boat had agreed to abide by ""[his] interpretation of the restrictions,"" and had asked for clarification.  he also appears to have overlooked boston boat's carefully-worded reply -- that it had no intention of violating ""the restrictions,"" but conspicuously omitting any mention of the judge's interpretation of them -- and its further clear statements that if it were going to be made a defendant over its objection, it would not agree to a judgment, would not waive ""any rights,"" and wished to ""take part in some of the litigation that was missed in the last four years.""  these statements plainly indicated boston boat's intent to litigate further the validity and interpretation of the restrictions, despite prior interlocutory rulings on those issues that were adverse to its predecessors in title.as reluctant as we are to hold a judge's finding about events in his own court room to be clearly erroneous, we are constrained to do so here.  ""a finding is 'clearly erroneous' when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.""  marlow v. new bedford,, 508 (1976), quoting from united states v. united states gypsum co., 333 u.s. 364, 395 (1948).  here, the ""entire evidence"" includes the transcript of the september 8, 2010, hearing, which leaves us with the definite and firm conviction that boston boat did not agree to be bound by the judge's prior interpretations of the restrictions.  to be sure, boston boat could have answered the judge's question more directly, by affirmatively stating its refusal to agree.  we should not bepage 536misunderstood as condoning anything less than full and forthright answers to questions from the bench.  but boston boat's implicit negative answer, coupled with its clear reservations of rights, compels us to reject the judge's finding that boston boat had agreed to be bound.here, an agreement to be bound was essential to the ultimate estoppel-based contempt finding.  if boston boat was not bound, then either its later conduct was not ""disobedience,"" or there was no ""clear and unequivocal command"" applicable to it in the first place.  either way, the contempt finding was not ""supported by clear and convincing evidence of disobedience of a clear and unequivocal command.""  birchall, 454 mass. at 853.  it lacked ""the level of certainty appropriate to justify civil contempt sanctions,"" a serious matter.  id. at 852.conclusion.  we affirm the judgment on the underlying complaint and reverse the order finding boston boat in contempt.so ordered.",civil,None,affirm

[547]","the town of framinghamappeals from a superior court order denying its motion for a preliminary injunction against the arbitration of a police officer's transfer to the patrol division.  we conclude that the transfer and assignment of police officers is within the exclusive managerial authority of the police chief as apage 538matter of public safety pursuant to g. l. c. 41, § 97a, and may not be delegated or contravened through arbitration or collective bargaining.  this is so even where it is claimed that the transfer or assignment was motivated by the police chief's perception of the officer's misconduct.  furthermore, we conclude that a municipality seeking to enforce its statutory rights to exclusive managerial authority need not show irreparable harm to be entitled to a preliminary injunction.  accordingly, we reverse the order denying the preliminary injunction.1.  background.  officer matthew gutwill is a police officer in the framingham police department (department) and a member of the framingham police officers union (union).  the terms of officer gutwill's employment are governed by the collective bargaining agreement (cba) entered into by the union and framingham on may 12, 2016.in 2004, officer gutwill began working for the department in the patrol division and was then transferred to the detective bureau, where he served from 2006 to 2008.  in framingham, an assignment to the detective bureau does not confer the rank of detective in the department.  it is a specialty assignment distinguished from the patrol division based on the position's role and job requirements, rather than senior employment status within the department.  as a detective, officer gutwill received a weekly stipend and a more flexible schedule.in 2008, officer gutwill was assigned to work as a detective with a federal drug enforcement agency (dea) task force.  the assignment was consecutively renewed through 2015 but was at all times temporary, made at the sole discretion of the police chief with the express reservation of managerial authority to transfer or to reassign officer gutwill at any time.while working full time and under the operational command of the dea, officer gutwill remained employed by the department and continued to receive his detective stipend.  he also enjoyed an increased differential pay rate for nighttime work and additional overtime compensation.on september 22, 2015, officer gutwill lodged a complaint with the department, alleging misconduct against another detectivepage 539in the department.  the complaint triggered a four-month internal investigation, and officer gutwill was displeased with its result.  officer gutwill also claimed that he was subjected to workplace harassment by members of the department in retaliation for making allegations against a fellow detective.in january, 2016, he was informed that the department intended to rotate him out of the dea task force at an undetermined date to an undetermined position.  the department maintains that the transfer was dictated by sound risk management policy to provide opportunities for other officers, to allow rotated officers to share specialized knowledge and experience within the department, and to reduce entrenchment and other concerns associated with so-called ""high risk positions.""  officer gutwill, by contrast, suspected the reassignment was made in retaliation for his initial and ongoing complaints.officer gutwill sought to air his concerns to the police chief in a february 5, 2016, telephone call.  during the conversation, officer gutwill allegedly made several inflammatory statements to the police chief.  officer gutwill claimed that a deputy chief lied while testifying in a criminal case, and that another deputy chief was implicated in other misconduct through a federal wiretap recording.  officer gutwill also expressed that he was unable to work with fellow detectives as a result of what he believed was retaliatory harassment, and that his complaints were being ignored by the department.  based on these claims, officer gutwill told the police chief that he planned to file a complaint with the massachusetts commission against discrimination, and stated something to the effect that he would ""turn the place upside down.""in response, the department retained an attorney on february 16, 2016, to conduct an independent investigation of officer gutwill's accusations.  the investigation commenced on march 1, 2016, and continued through july, 2016, during which time officer gutwill's reassignment was delayed pending the outcome of the investigation.  after substantial inquiry, the investigator issued a report dated july 14, 2016, determining that the allegations of retaliation were without merit.  despite the absence of any suggestion in the investigator's report that officer gutwill was dishonest,the police chief accused officer gutwill of denying to the investigator that he made various statements in the februarypage 5405, 2016, telephone call.based on the police chief's accusations, officer gutwill was placed on paid administrative leave on august 19, 2016, through december 12, 2016, when he was suspended for five days without pay.according to the department, the suspension resulted from violations of rules prohibiting ""untruthfulness"" concerning officer gutwill's denial of the statements made to the police chief on february 5, 2016.when officer gutwill returned to duty on december 19, 2016, after his suspension, he was reassigned from the detective bureau to the patrol division.  the department cited ""a variety of reasons"" for the transfer, ""including an independent investigator's finding that he was untruthful during an official investigation,"" in determining ""that it was in the [d]epartment's best interest to assign him to the [p]atrol [d]ivision.""  officer gutwill immediately challenged the decision in a verbal grievance, which was denied by the police chief.the union responded by submitting a written grievance on behalf of officer gutwill on december 21, 2016, alleging that his reassignment from the detective bureau to the patrol division constituted ""discipline"" without ""just cause,"" in violation of the cba.  the union requested the immediate reinstatement of officer gutwill to the detective bureau.  the department denied this grievance on the ground that the legislature had declared that the assignments of police officers is ""an exclusive managerial prerogative"" not subject to collective bargaining.  the framingham town manager upheld the denial.  pursuant to the cba, the union filed a demand for arbitration on january 17, 2017, on behalf of officer gutwill.page 541on march 2, 2017, framingham filed a civil complaint and moved for a preliminary injunction enjoining arbitration, which was duly opposed by the union.  after a hearing, a superior court judge (motion judge) denied the preliminary injunction in a decision entered june 28, 2017.we have jurisdiction over framingham's interlocutory appeal pursuant to g. l. c. 231, § 118.see massachusetts correction officers

otherwise, police ""managers would have no ability to react to changing conditions in arranging the police force into the necessary bureaus, units, and divisions.""  id. at 216.general laws c. 41, § 97a, confers the same statutory authority provided to the police commissioner in that case to the police chief in this matter.  see andover police patrolmen's union, 45 mass. app. ct. at 169-170.  indeed, the cba does as well.  moreover, even if the cba provided otherwise, it could not abrogate the police chief's authority to transfer, assign, and deploy officers according to the police chief's discretion.  massachusetts coalition of police, local 165 v. northborough,, 255 (1993) (""a town may not by agreement abandon a nondelegable right of management"").in short, because the assignment and the deployment of police officers is a nondelegable right of management, it is not a proper subject of collective bargaining.in this respect, the union's reliance on boston v. boston police patrolmen's assn.,(2017), is misplaced.  there, the police commissioner terminated an officer for using excessive force against a civilian after the saint patrick's day parade, and for being untruthful.  id. at 435, 437-438.  an arbitrator discredited the civilian's account and ordered the officer reinstated.  id. at 439.  on review, the supreme judicial court found that ""corepage 545matters of discipline and discharge"" are delegable and, specifically, a termination may be the subject of an arbitration pursuant to a cba.  id. at 441.  absent from that case was any suggestion that the arbitrator could order that the officer be given any duty, deployment, or assignment.  the arbitrator merely ""reinstated [the officer] with back pay.""  id. at 439.  the supreme judicial court provided no hint that an arbitrator could require the police commissioner to assign the officer to another saint patrick's day parade or even require that he be assigned to patrol duty.  to the contrary, the court repeatedly relied on boston police superior officers fedn., 466 mass. at 216, and provided a long list of cases holding that assignments are nondelegable.  boston police patrolmen's assn., supra at 440, 441 & n.7.there is no question that officer gutwill's suspension may be challenged or that, had he been terminated, the union could seek his reinstatement.  indeed, the union could presumably challenge any action of the police chief with respect to officer gutwill (if in violation of the cba) other than his assignment.  similarly, if detective had been a rank in framingham, such that the police chief had demoted him, officer gutwill could have challenged the reduction in rank.although there is little reason to doubt that officer gutwill's disciplinary history was considered in the department's assignment decision, the grievance materially challenged only the reassignment itself.  ""[the] mere characterization of a feature of a collective bargain or an arbitration award as . . . 'terms or conditions of employment' or some other subject conventionally or by law within the scope of either process, will not save the [feature] if in substance it defeats a declared legislative purpose.""  lynn, 43 mass. app. ct. at 176, quoting from watertown firefighters, local 1347 v. watertown,, 714 (1978).  the substantive actions disputed in this case are within the exclusive purview of the police chief pursuant to g. l. c. 41, § 97a, and the doctrine of nondelegability.framingham is not required to justify the transfer and reassignment of officer gutwillpage 546or prove that the decision, predicated on the best interests of the department, was not otherwise pretext behind disciplinary motives.worcester, 438 mass. at 183 (city not required to ""present evidence explaining or justifying its decision"" concerning nondelegable law enforcement action within managerial prerogative).a simple example demonstrates why this must be so.  under the union's interpretation of the statutory scheme, the police chief may freely transfer any police officer with a spotless disciplinary record from the detective bureau to the patrol division, and no challenge to that action would be possible.  if, however, an officer has been disciplined, any transfer of (or, even, failure to provide a requested assignment to) that officer could be subject to grievance and arbitration to determine whether it was disciplinary and whether it was supported by just cause.  such a regime not only defies logic, but would impose an intolerable burden on a police chief's managerial authority ""where matters of public safety are concerned.""  saugus pub. safety dispatchers union, 65 mass. app. ct. at 902.the transfer and reassignment of officer gutwill is a nondelegable decision.  parties cannot agree to arbitrate a dispute that ""lawfully cannot be the subject of arbitration,"" department of state police v. massachusetts org. of state engrs. & scientists,, 455 (2010), quoting from dennis-yarmouth regional sch. comm. v. dennis teachers assn.,, 119 (1977), and a court may not order the arbitration of a dispute that the parties did not agree to arbitrate.  merrimack college v. kpmg llp,, 808 (2016).  neither this court nor any arbitrator, as a result, may contravene the decision made by the police chief in this case.  see, e.g., massachusetts coalition of police, local 165, 416 mass. at 255256; sheriff of middlesex county v. international bhd. of correctional officers, local r1-193,, 831 (2005).  the matterpage 547may not be submitted to arbitration; accordingly, framingham is likely to succeed on the merits as a matter of law.5.  public interest.  on the second prong of the preliminary injunction assessment, the requested relief promotes the public interest.  see caplan, 479 mass. at 95.  the doctrine of nondelegability, in respect to the exclusive managerial prerogative of law enforcement authorities and g. l. c. 41, § 97a, is predicated on the prevailing interests of public safety.  see taunton branch of the mass. police assn., 10 mass. app. ct. at 243-245; andover police patrolmen's union, 45 mass. app. ct. at 169-170; saugus police superior officers union, 64 mass. app. ct. at 917.  in accordance with the preceding analysis, enjoining arbitration here promotes public safety by allowing the effective and flexible deployment of law enforcement resources and personnel, see boston police superior officers fedn., 466 mass. at 215216, as well as ""preserv[ing] the intended role of the governmental agency and its accountability in the political process.""  id. at 214, quoting from lynn, 43 mass. app. ct. at 178.6.  conclusion.  framingham is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim, and a preliminary injunction promotes the public interest as reflected in g. l. c. 41, § 97a, and the doctrine of nondelegation in law enforcement decision-making.  framingham is therefore entitled to a preliminary injunction enjoining arbitration of the transfer and reassignment of officer gutwill as grieved by the union.  because the motion judge erred in finding otherwise, we reverse the order denying the preliminary injunction and a new order shall enter allowing framingham's motion for a preliminary injunction.so ordered.",civil,0.0,0.0

adjacent lots when the town first adopted a minimum lot sizepage 549requirement in 1953, and that therefore the lots had to be treated as one under the doctrine of merger.  on cross motions for

control over the trust's assets, albeit subject to her fiduciary duties to the trust's beneficiary, her mother.  when the trust purchased the parcel, mead herself already owned adjacent property, where she long has lived.  the judge ruled that the confluence of mead's broad authority over the parcel as cotrustee and her ownership of the adjacent property in her own name effectively placed the two properties in common ownership.  based on this, he concluded that the properties must be treated as one for zoning purposes under the doctrine of merger, explaining his ruling in a carefully reasoned memorandum of decision.  kneer appealed.  thomas murray, an abutter and the intervener, filed a cross appeal.  despite the cogency of the judge's explanation for his ruling, we conclude that he misapplied the relevant legal principles.  we therefore vacate the judgment and remand this case for further proceedings.background.  the recitation that follows is drawn from the judge's detailed findings of fact, none of which has been shown to be clearly erroneous.  we supplement those findings slightly based on the agreed-to documentary evidence and other undisputed background evidence.  nps, llc v. minnihan,, 418 (2008).1.  the adoption of the town zoning by-law.  the town adopted its first zoning by-law in 1953.  that by-law established a minimum lot size of 15,000 square feet (since increased to 43,500 square feet, or approximately one acre, at least in the applicable zoning district).  at that time, the land in the neighborhood at issue already had been laid out as lots depicted in a land courtpage 550plan that had been filed in the registry of deeds in 1945.  each of the current properties is comprised of two or more of the originally depicted lots.  thus, the parcel itself is made up of original lots 46 and 47, mead's own land is made up of lots 44 and 45, and murray's land is made up of lots 6, 12, and 13.  at the time the 1953 by-law was adopted, the lots that now comprise the parcel were held in common with other adjacent lots, including lots 48 and 49.  the parcel was severed from that common ownership in 1954.the 1953 by-law included a grandfathering provision.  we reserve for later discussion whether the specific terms of that provision protected the parcel as buildable even though it was held in common ownership with adjacent land when the by-law was adopted.2.  the kneer family's ties to the hunter avenue neighborhood.  although kneer herself lives elsewhere, all three of her daughters have had significant ties to the town's hunter avenue neighborhood.  mead has had the strongest ties; she and her then-husband first purchased property there in 1978, and she has lived at her current property, 11 hunter avenue, since 1988.3.  the formation of the trust.  meanwhile, in 2001, kneer and her husband created the trust as an estate planning tool.  the two of them were the trust's sole beneficiaries and cotrustees.  they placed various personal assets into the trust, including their bank accounts and investment accounts.4.  the original acquisition of the parcel.  the parcel is bordered on the east by 11 hunter avenue (owned by mead) and on the west by 7 hunter avenue (owned by murray).  as of 2002, the town had acquired the parcel through a tax taking.  through a public auction, mead's oldest son, douglas, acquired title to the parcel on july 15, 2002.  however, some nine months later, he transferred title to the person who had provided him with the purchase money, richard w. drisko.  drisko was douglas's uncle by marriage (the husband of one of kneer's other daughters).5.  the 2010 amendment to the trust.  in 2010, kneer's husband -- who had been the trust's cobeneficiary and cotrustee -- died.  kneer therefore amended the trust through a restatement dated may 24, 2010 (first restatement).  although kneer remained the trust's sole beneficiary, mead was added as a cotrustee.  further details of the trust's terms, as amended, are reserved for later discussion.6.  the trust's purchase of the parcel.  in or before 2012, drisko and his wife divorced.  as a result, kneer ""wanted to help severpage 551[her former son-in-law's] ties to the [parcel].""  she also ""considered that there might come a time when she would want to live near ms. mead"" (her eldest daughter).  accordingly, on september 14, 2012, the trust -- which had been formed more than a decade earlier -- purchased the parcel from drisko for $50,000.  as a result, the parcel became held by kneer and mead as cotrustees.7.  efforts to develop the parcel.  at least by 2013, mead began efforts to secure approval to build a small home on the parcel.  this included applying for a septic system construction permit and a building permit.  the permit applications were in the trust's name, and kneer was the sole signatory on the documents.  mead did all the spadework in seeking the permits; for example, she was the one who prepared the applications and served as the point of contact for town officials.8.  procedural history.  on july 13, 2013, the town health agent granted the trust approval to install a septic system at the parcel, which was referred to as 9 hunter avenue.  however, the town building inspector denied the trust's application for a building permit on april 8, 2014.  relying on an opinion letter from town counsel, the building inspector concluded that the parcel was subject to the applicable minimum lot size requirement and therefore was unbuildable.  the opinion letter appears to rest on two independent grounds.  the first is that the parcel was never subject to grandfathered protection because it was held in common ownership with other undersized lots when the town adopted its zoning by-law in 1953.  the second is based on the application of merger doctrine to the trust's acquisition of the parcel in 2012.  according to counsel, mead's serving as cotrustee of the trust and simultaneously owning the adjacent property in her own name meant that the two properties must be considered as one for zoning purposes.  the town zoning board of appeals (board) upheld the building commissioner's denial of a building permit based on his first stated ground, without reaching the second.  kneer appealed pursuant to g. l. c. 40a, § 17, and murray was allowed to intervene as a defendant.on summary judgment, the judge rejected the argument that the parcel was never subject to grandfathering protection.  however, after a two-day trial, he upheld the denial of the building permit on the second ground, namely that, as of the date the trust acquired the parcel in 2012, it merged with mead's adjacent property.  relying principally on planning bd. of norwell v. serena,page 552, 690 (1989), s.c.,(1990) (serena), the judge focused on whether -- through her role as cotrustee -- mead obtained legal control over the parcel at the point the trust acquired it.  the judge recognized that, in taking any actions with respect to the parcel (or, for that matter, with respect to any other assets of the trust), mead was obligated to act consistent with her fiduciary duties to kneer (who was cosettlor, cotrustee, and sole remaining beneficiary).  he also recognized that, with or without cause, kneer could at any time terminate mead as cotrustee or even revoke the trust.  at the same time, however, as the judge accurately observed, so long as the trust existed and mead continued to serve as one of its cotrustees, her powers were broad.  most significantly, she could take action with respect to trust assets without first consulting with kneer, and third parties were informed that they could rely on the actions of one cotrustee acting alone.according to the judge, this provided mead sufficient control over the parcel that it must be considered as being held in common ownership with the adjacent land that she owned.discussion.  1.  the relationship between grandfathering and merger.  it is uncontested that, under the town's current zoning by-law, the parcel does not meet current minimum lot size requirements.  indeed, the parcel became nonconforming when zoning initially was adopted in 1953.  it follows that the parcel is unbuildable unless it enjoys grandfathering protection.by statute, owners of existing lots generally are protected against newly adopted minimum lot size requirements.  see g. l. c. 40a, § 6.  however, protection offered by grandfathering must be considered in conjunction with the doctrine of merger.  that doctrine aptly has been summarized as follows:  ""[a]djacent lots in commonpage 553ownership will normally be treated as a single lot for zoning purposes so as to minimize nonconformities.""  preston v. board of appeals of hull,, 238 (2001), quoting from seltzer v. board of appeals of orleans,, 522 (1987).  although merger has its roots in the common law, ""[t]he statutory 'grandfather' provision contained in g. l. c. 40a, § 6, incorporates this doctrine by providing protection from increases in lot area and frontage requirements only to nonconforming lots that are not held in common ownership with any adjoining land.""  carabetta v. board of appeals of truro,, 269 (2008).  thus, the statute itself does not protect undersized lots from merger.  however, a town may adopt more generous grandfathering protection if it does so explicitly.  marinelli v. board of appeals of stoughton,, 903 (2005).the town's zoning by-law now offers grandfathering protection that is coextensive with that offered by g. l. c. 40a, § 6.  therefore, it is undisputed that the parcel currently is not protected from merger, and that it therefore is no longer buildable if it merged with mead's adjacent property.  before turning to that question, we first examine the subject of murray's cross appeal, that is, whether the parcel ever enjoyed grandfathered protection when the town adopted zoning in 1953, or whether instead, as the board concluded, merger applied at that time.2.  alleged merger in 1953.  the section of the 1953 by-law that established minimum lot size and frontage requirements included a grandfathering provision that stated as follows:  ""lots shown on any plan duly recorded by deed or plan at the time this [by-law] is adopted may be used.""  we agree with the judge that this language plainly intended to offer grandfathering protection to then-existing lots so long as at that time the lots were shown on a plan that had been recorded.  see shirley wayside ltd. partnership v. board of appeals of shirley,, 474-475 (2012), and cases cited (while deference is due to reasonable interpretations of by-law by relevant local officials, meaning of by-law is ultimately question of law for courts).  it is uncontested that lots 46 and 47 (of which the parcel is comprised) were depicted on a plan that was recorded eight years prior to the adoption of the 1953 by-law.  accordingly, these lots did not lose their grandfathered protection simply because they were held in common ownership with other adjoining lots in 1953.  see marinelli, 65 mass. app. ct. at 903.  lots 46 and 47 then were severed from common ownership with other adjacent lots in 1954page 554prior to the town's tightening of its grandfathering provision.the judge correctly determined that the parcel did not lose grandfathering protection upon the initial adoption of the zoning by-law.3.  alleged merger in 2012.  the key inquiry is whether, as a result of the trust's acquisition of the parcel in 2012, it became held in common ownership with mead's adjacent property at 11 hunter avenue.  as the judge observed, the case law recognizes that lots can be deemed to be held in common ownership under the doctrine of merger even if they nominally are owned by different entities.  we turn next to examining representative cases that illustrate this principle.in serena, 27 mass. app. ct. at 690, s.c.,, the case on which the judge primarily relied in his memorandum of decision, a married couple wanted to subdivide property they owned into two buildable lots.  to avoid the effects of an anticipated change to the zoning by-law, they transferred one lot to themselves as tenants by the entirety and the other to themselves as trustees of a realty trust of which they were the sole beneficiaries.  serena, 406 mass. at 1009.  the land court judge there had ""concluded that the serenas were entitled only to one building permit for the combined lots because the serenas could use the two lots 'as one if they so chose.'""  ibid.  in a three-paragraph rescript opinion, the supreme judicial court affirmed the land court judgment.  ibid.  despite the brevity of the opinion, it is plain that the court endorsed the principle that ""a landowner will not be permitted to create a dimensional nonconformity if he could have used his adjoining land to avoid or diminish the nonconformity.""  ibid., quoting from serena, 27 mass. app. ct. at 690 (appeals court decision in same case for which further appellate review was granted).page 555because the property owners in serena owned one lot as cotrustees of a realty trust of which they were the sole beneficiaries, and owned the adjoining lot personally as tenants by the entireties, they together retained full legal and beneficial ownership of the two lots and were free to use the lots ""as one if they so chose.""ibid.  serena thus presented a markedly straightforward case for looking beyond the nominal form of the ownership interests and treating contiguous parcels as being held in common ownership.a second illustrative example is distefano v. stoughton,(1994), another case in which an owner unsuccessfully tried to avoid merger by placing some of its property into nominally different ownership.  distefano involved a forty-lot tract of land that had been owned by a close corporation of which a particular individual was the sole officer and director.  id. at 643, 645.  in anticipation of a zoning amendment that would reduce the number of buildable lots, the individual had his company transfer ownership of some of the lots to himself individually, some to his wife, and some to himself as trustee of a realty trust.  id. at 644.  this left the property divided in a ""checkerboard"" pattern, in which ""no two [adjoining] lots were held in common"" by the same nominal owner.  id. at 643.  the land court judge in that case found that the same individual retained full control of all of the lots notwithstanding that they nominally became held by four different owners.  ibid.  we upheld the judge's ruling that merger applied under these circumstances, pronouncing that ""[w]e may disregard the shell of purportedly discrete legal persons engaged in business when there is activepage 556and pervasive control of those legal persons by the same controlling person and there is a confusing intermingling of activity among the purportedly separate legal persons while engaging in a common enterprise.""  id. at 645, citing my bread baking co. v. cumberland farms, inc.,, 620-621 (1968) (then, as now, the leading case on piercing the corporate veil).  in this manner, we equated disregarding nominally different ownership for purposes of applying the doctrine of merger with ""veil piercing.""in these and similar cases, the same person who possessed the power to control the contiguous lots retained the ability to use them as he desired, including to ""use[] his adjoining land to avoid or diminish the nonconformity.""  serena, 406 mass. at 1009, quoting from serena, 27 mass. app. ct at 690.  our willingness to look beyond who nominally held legal title to the lots must be seen in this light.we turn now from the case law to the case before us.  critically, the judge did not rule that the existence of the trust should be disregarded, with mead herself deemed the real owner of the parcel.  to the contrary, the judge relied on the existence of the trust, resting his decision solely on the breadth of mead's authority as cotrustee.  because mead possessed broad authority to take actions with respect to trust assets without needing to seek kneer's prior approval, the judge ruled that this effectively gave her ""legal control"" of the parcel.  in turn, the judge reasoned, the breadth of this authority was sufficient, by itself, to place the parcel in common ownership with the adjacent property that mead owned individually.the error in the judge's reasoning is that it passes over the fact that mead's powers over the parcel necessarily were subject to her fiduciary obligations.  see old colony trust co. v. silliman,, 10 (1967) (""[e]ven very broad discretionary powers [of a trustee] are to be exercised in accordance with fiduciary standards and with reasonable regard for usual fiduciary principles"").  as a trustee, mead's ""first duty [was] the protection of the trust estate,"" and she could not allow any of her own interests to interfere with those of kneer, the trust's beneficiary.  johnson v. witkowski,, 706 (1991).  the judge acknowledged that limitation but ultimately found it to be of no moment.  we disagree.  mead was not in a position in which she lawfully could have appropriated the parcel as her own; indeed, such conduct would have amounted to an obvious breach of herpage 557fiduciary responsibilities.  ibid.accordingly, despite the breadth of the authority that mead possessed as cotrustee, she still could not lawfully use the parcel to lessen the nonconformity of her own property with the minimum lot size requirement.  it follows that mead's status as cotrustee of the trust that owned the parcel did not, by itself, render the two properties as being held in common ownership.  see serena, 406 mass. at 1009.none of this is to say that the existence of mead's fiduciary duties to kneer necessarily insulated mead -- or the trust -- from a claim of veil piercing.  nor do we mean to suggest that the judge could not have considered whether the trust was used as a means of masking an arrangement in which, in reality, it was mead, not kneer, who held ""the master hand.""  distefano, 36 mass. app. ct. at 645.  thus, it may be that the judge was correct to conclude that the parcel and mead's property should be viewed as a single lot based on grounds different from those on which he relied.  we turn next to whether the veil piercing issues can be resolved, as a matter of law, in favor of either party.there are some established facts that cut in favor of veil piercing and merger.  for example, the judge found that mead ""in fact has exercised control over the . . . [p]arcel,"" and he rejected kneer's claim that mead was leading the effort to develop it ""simply to help her mother.""at the same time, however, the judge expressly found that in taking her actions with respect to the property, ""mead was acting in her capacity as [co]trustee.""  thus, the mere fact that mead exercised control over the parcel does not mean that she strayed from her role as a cotrustee faithfully serving kneer's interests.in addition, there are some established facts that cut against disregarding the difference in thepage 558nominal owners.  for example, the formation of the trust preceded the purchase of the parcel by more than ten years, and there was no evidence that mead's addition as cotrustee after her father died was done in anticipation of the trust's eventual purchase of the parcel.moreover, it is uncontested that in seeking to develop the parcel, kneer was the one in whose name the permits were sought, establishing that trust formalities were, at least to some extent, observed.in the end, we conclude that whether the board could disregard the separate ownership here and treat the parcel and mead's property as one cannot be resolved as a matter of law based on the current findings.  it is evident that the trial judge saw little need to address head on whether mead should be treated as the real owner of the parcel, because he believed the merger issue could and should be resolved on the face of the trust documents.  where, as here, the judge made findings based on an incorrect view of the law but still could be correct for a different reason, ""fairness requires a remand to allow the parties and the judge to focus on [the key legal issue we have identified].""  julius tofias & co. v. john b. stetson co.,, 398 (1985).conclusion.  in sum, we conclude that the parcel was not rendered unbuildable pursuant to the doctrine of merger as a result of the adoption of the zoning by-law in 1953.  we further conclude that the judge erred in ruling -- based merely on the breadth of mead's authority as cotrustee -- that merger occurred when the trust purchased the parcel in 2012.  nevertheless, it is possible on this record that facts could be found that would support merger on other grounds.accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.so ordered.",civil,Keith C.

[562-563]there was no merit to a criminal defendant's argument that indecent assault and battery, as defined under g. l. c. 265, § 13b, was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts that the defendant hugged the victim for a prolonged time while extensively licking in and around her ear and held on when she tried to get away, in that the defendant's conduct fell comfortably within the standards for indecency previously set forth in other cases, i.e., it was fundamentally offensive and immodest and improper because of its sexual overtones, and nothing in prior cases suggested that the defendant's conduct would not qualify as indecent. [563-564]","the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, where he hugged the victim for a prolonged time while extensively licking in and around her ear.  we hold that thepage 561evidence, in context, was sufficient to support the conviction, and that the criminal offense of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen is not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts here.background.  we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the commonwealth.  the defendant and the victim met for the first time at a family barbecue on september 6, 2015.  the defendant was fifty-eight years old at the time; the victim, thirteen.  the family relationship was distant; the defendant was the brother of a relative of the victim's stepfather.   there were twelve to fifteen people at the barbecue.sometime during the barbecue the victim was introduced to the defendant; the victim testified that during the barbecue the defendant was looking at her in a way that made her ""uncomfortable.""  as the barbecue was winding down, the victim went to leave and encountered the defendant in a doorway.  the defendant put his arms out for a hug; no one else was present, as the remaining guests were in another room at the time.  the victim hugged the defendant.  the defendant then pulled the victim to him, ""right on his chest,"" and ""wouldn't let [the victim] go.""  the defendant then began licking the victim's ear, including licking all around her three ear piercings, and inserting his tongue in her ear.  the victim tried to get away, but the defendant held on.  the hugging and ear licking went on for a prolonged period; the victim testified, ""i honestly don't know [the] exact time, but it felt like forever.""  when another of the victim's relatives came in the vicinity and called her name, the defendant pushed the victim away and she left.the trial was jury-waived.  the judge convicted the defendant of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, in violation of g. l. c. 265, § 13b; as to this charge the defendant was sentenced to two and one-half years in the house of correction, with ninety days to serve, the balance suspended for two years' probation.on appeal, the defendant raises two issues:  first, that the evidence of ear licking and hugging was insufficient to constitute indecent assault and battery as a matter of law, and second, that the term ""indecent"" in the criminal statute is not sufficiently defined and therefore is unconstitutionally vague.page 562discussion.  a.  sufficiency of the evidence.  as to the defendant's first argument, we review a challenge to sufficiency of the evidence to determine ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""  commonwealth v. lattimore,, 677 (1979) (quotation omitted).to sustain a conviction of indecent assault and battery on a child, the commonwealth must prove ""that (1) the child was not yet fourteen years old at the time of the offense, (2) the defendant intentionally touched the child without legal justification or excuse, and (3) the touching was indecent.""  commonwealth v. cruz,, 138 (2018).  see g. l. c. 265, § 13b.  there is no issue on appeal as to the sufficiency of the evidence on the first two elements.  rather, the question on appeal is whether, on these facts, the evidence was sufficient to establish that the unwanted touching by the defendant was ""indecent.""several of our cases have addressed the question of what conduct constitutes ""indecent"" assault and battery.  we have stated that ""the intentional, unjustified touching of private areas such as the breasts, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, and pubic area of a female constitutes an indecent assault and battery.""  commonwealth v. mosby,, 184 (1991) (quotation omitted).  these areas have been classified as ""sexual parts.""  commonwealth v. rosa,, 625 (2004).  but this list ""is not intended to be exhaustive,"" and our cases have held that the unjustified touching of other areas of the body may also qualify as indecent, depending upon context.  ibid.  the mouth, in particular, has been recognized as an ""intimate"" body part, and we have held that the insertion of a tongue during a kiss, commonwealth v. castillo,, 565-567 (2002), and the insertion of fingers into the mouth coupled with sexual commentary, can constitute indecency.  rosa, 62 mass. app. ct. at 624-626.in an effort to define an ""indecent touching"" more generally, we have said that it is a touching that is ""fundamentally offensive to contemporary moral values,"" mosby, 30 mass. app. ct. at 184 (quotation omitted), and that ""society would regard as immodest and improper because of its sexual overtones . . . .""  commonwealth v. ortiz,, 779 (1999).  see commonwealth v. miozza,, 572 (2006).  the test is an objective one, see castillo, 55 mass. app. ct. at 565,page 563and our cases have set forth several other guideposts for consideration, to wit:  whether there is a disparity in age and sophistication between assaulter and victim; whether there is an existing relationship between them; and, whether there is evidence of surreptitious behavior or the use of force.  see id. at 567; cruz, 93 mass. app. ct. at 139.  these guideposts can help to separate conduct that is objectively offensive and sexual from conduct that may in fact be innocent.applying these standards, we have no difficulty concluding that there was sufficient evidence of an indecent assault and battery here.  while ears may not be on the list of ""sexual parts,"" they are intimate enough so that the insertion of a tongue into an ear can reasonably qualify as ""indecent.""  indeed, here it is very difficult to credit any suggestion that the conduct was not sexual in nature -- unlike a hug or a kiss, an extended ear licking is not normal behavior between persons who are not intimate.  and of course, here the evidence of context adds greatly to the calculus.  the age disparity was substantial - - fifty-eight to thirteen.  the location of the contact was sufficiently separate from the others at the barbecue that it could be found to be surreptitious -- particularly where the defendant broke off his conduct as soon as another person was in the vicinity.  this behavior tends to confirm not only that the conduct was improper, but that the defendant knew it was.  see rosa, 62 mass. app. ct. at 626.  importantly as well, there was an element of force used here -- the victim testified that she tried to break away, but the defendant would not let go.  there was more than sufficient evidence for the judge to find ""indecency.""b.  vagueness.  the defendant argues, alternatively, that ""indecent assault and battery,"" as defined under g. l. c. 265, § 13b, is unconstitutionally vague, because ""persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning.""  commonwealth v. quinn,, 499 (2003) (quotation omitted).  the defendant urges that ""based on how the statute has previously been defined and interpreted,"" one would not know that licking an ear could qualify as ""indecent.""we disagree.  a statute is not unconstitutionally vague merely because its terms require judicial construction, or because ""it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but comprehensible normative standard.""  commonwealth v. gallant,, 580 (1977) (quotation omitted).  the vagueness challenge is to the statute as applied to the defendant's facts.  seepage 564id. at 581, quoting from united states v. powell, 423 u.s. 87, 92 (1975) (""[v]agueness challenges to statutes which do not involve first amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand"").  here, once again, we have no difficulty concluding that the defendant's conduct fell comfortably within those behaviors that are encompassed within the standards for ""indecency"" previously set forth in our cases -- because the conduct was ""fundamentally offensive,"" and ""immodest and improper because of its sexual overtones.""  moreover, nothing in our prior cases suggests that the conduct at issue would not qualify as indecent.  under the above standards there is no material difference between the intentional insertion of a tongue into the victim's mouth in castillo, and the defendant's intentional insertion of his tongue into the victim's ear, here.recently, in commonwealth v. cruz,(2018), we addressed facts that were not sufficient to constitute indecency.  those facts included a brief but tight hug, ""like a hug [the victim's] parents would give her,"" a kiss on the neck, which in the victim's words was ""not anything that necessarily alarmed her,"" and the slight lifting of a corner of the victim's shirt, but without exposing or touching of skin.  id. at 137.  while the majority and concurring opinions in cruz help to further define the boundaries of indecent assault, the facts here are plainly distinguishable from cruz.  this case does not involve a parental-like hug and a brief kiss on the neck; it involves a forced hug that ""felt like forever,"" coupled with the licking of an ear, and the insertion of a tongue ""over and over again.""see id. at 137-139.  there is nothing unconstitutionally vague about the term ""indecent"" as applied to these facts.judgments affirmed.",criminal,Therese M.

driver's seat of the vehicle.  ragab identified the man as dark-skinned, thin, and wearing a white jacket andpage 566a dark-colored winter hat.  he never saw the man's face.  ragab unsuccessfully attempted to remove the man from the suv.  the man drove off.  ragab called the police at 7:04 p.m. and immediately began to canvass the neighborhood looking for the suv.  he saw the vehicle, attempted to stop it, and was knocked to the ground.  the suv sped away in the direction of a stop & shop grocery store.  ragab returned to his place of employment to give a statement to the police when he again saw the suv.  the police pursued it by foot and by car.shortly thereafter, witness roger marcon was walking in the neighborhood and saw and heard the suv stop abruptly on the sidewalk on the stockwell street side of frawley street, near where he was walking.  he continued to walk.  although he did not see anyone get out of the suv, he looked back and saw the defendant, who is african-american, near the suv carrying grocery bags from stop & shop.  the lights were on and the driver's side door was open.  the defendant was wearing a dark coat and a dark winter hat, and looked disheveled, frightened, and confused.  marcon saw nobody else near the suv.  when the police arrived, marcon pointed them toward the defendant, who was then arrested.at the scene, a detective conducted a show-up of the defendant with ragab and marcon.  ragab was unable to make a positive identification of the defendant, although he stated that the defendant's hat and skin color matched those of the man who stole the suv.marcon, however, did make a positive identification with 100 percent confidence.  defense counsel's theory was that the defendant, who lived in the neighborhood, was simply walking home from the stop & shop.  however, the commonwealth elicited testimony at trial that the intersection of frawley street and stockwell street was not on the defendant's most direct route home from stop & shop.at trial, the commonwealth introduced in evidence a video recording from the stop & shop parking lot.  it showed that, at 7:00 p.m., an suv pulled into the parking lot, a person got out of the vehicle, a person then entered it approximately nine minutes later, and the suv drove off.page 567notwithstanding the equivocal identification by ragab, the testimony of marcon that, immediately upon hearing a vehicle screech to a halt on frawley street, he turned and saw the stolen vehicle with its lights on and door open and the defendant standing next to it holding bags of groceries and appearing disheveled, frightened, and confused, when combined with the facts that no other person was anywhere in the vicinity and that the location was not along the most direct walking route from the stop & shop to the defendant's house (in contravention of the defendant's claim that he was walking home from stop & shop), suffice to support the element of identification with respect to which the defendant claims there is insufficient evidence.  to be sure, the record contains no explanation for the fact that the video recording purporting to show the stolen suv entering the stop & shop parking lot was time stamped several minutes before the robbery occurred, rather than afterward.  while such circumstances might call into question the relevance of the videotape, the adequacy of its authentication, or whether its probative value was outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice from its introduction, there was no objection to its introduction, and the defendant does not claim it was error.  questions about the timing of the video recording, however, do not call into question the sufficiency of the evidence.2.  juror bias.  the defendant's other argument relates to comments made by a juror at the beginning of the third day of trial.  when the court officer went to say hello to the jurors, none of whom was african-american in the juror room before the commencement of proceedings on that day, juror no. ten said, ""good morning, it's a good day for a hanging.""  although the court officer stated that most jurors said, ""i can't believe you said that,"" juror no. six claimed that he thought some jurors laughed.the court officer informed the judge, who conferred with counsel.  the judge and defense counsel agreed that, given the sorry history of lynchings of african-americans in the united states, this comment by a juror who was not african-american had overtones of racial bias.  the prosecutor did not concede that one could infer racial bias from juror no. ten's comment, but understood that this was a valid interpretation, and agreed that a voir dire of all the jurors was proper.  the judge then interviewed juror no. ten and dismissed him.  subsequent to the voir dire of that juror, the judge apologized to the defendant and said, apparently reflecting her understanding of the racial overtones of the comment, ""i really do believe that most jurors don't believe, or have the beliefs that this juror expressed.""page 568she then conducted a voir dire of each juror, asking them, in substance, whether they heard juror no. ten's comments, how the other jurors reacted,whether juror no. ten's comment affected their ability to be fair and impartial, and whether they were satisfied that they could fairly and impartially decide the case.  she also requested that the jurors not discuss the matter with each other.  it was during this voir dire that juror no. six stated that he thought some of the other jurors laughed at juror no. ten's comment.  the judge concluded that each juror could continue to serve.  while defense counsel did not request that the judge conduct further or more detailed inquiry, and thanked the judge for the process she had undertaken, he nonetheless moved for a mistrial, which motion was denied.  it is from that ruling and the resulting judgments that he appeals.""[j]ustice must satisfy the appearance of justice.""  commonwealth v. patry,, 475 (2000), quoting from levine v. united states, 362 u.s. 610, 616 (1960).  particularly in the context of this case, with a jury with no african-american members but with an african-american defendant, a comment like juror no. ten's is a very serious matter.  cf. pena-rodriguez v. colorado, 137 s. ct. 855, 868-869 (2017) (""[r]acial bias [is] a familiar and recurring evil that, if left unaddressed, would risk systemic injury to the administration of justice.  this court's decisions demonstrate that racial bias implicates unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns.  an effort to address the most grave and serious statements of racial bias is not an effort to perfect the jury but to ensure that our legal system remains capable of coming ever closer to the promise of equal treatment under the law that is so central to a functioning democracy. . . .  all forms of improper bias pose challenges to the trial process.  but there is a sound basis to treat racial bias with added precaution.  a constitutional rule that racial bias in the justice system must be addressed -- including, in some instances, after the verdict has been entered -- is necessary to prevent a systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a central premise of the sixth amendment trial right"").we do not, however, write on a blank slate with respect to the question before us.  our decision is controlled by the supreme judicial court's decision in commonwealth v. tavares,, cert. denied, 457 u.s. 1137 (1982).  there, deliberatingpage 569jurors were exposed to a racially charged comment by one of their number, and the judge learned of it before the verdict was returned.  the supreme judicial court held that ""the judge interrogat[ing] the jurors and conclud[ing] that they could fairly and impartially render a verdict,"" id. at 156 -- as the judge did here -- sufficed to address the risk of the other jurors' exposure to what the court described as ""extraneous prejudicial information.""  id. at 154.  thus, under tavares, no further questioning, for example, including questions to each juror about whether he or she laughed at juror no. ten's comment, and why,nor application of any heightened burden, presumption, or per se rule, to ensure impartiality, was required in this case.defendants, the courts, and the community should be left with no doubt about whether jurors harbor racial prejudice.  see pena-rodriguez, 137 s. ct. at 869.  the risk even of the appearance that racial prejudice might have infected the judicial process, notwithstanding the sensitive efforts of the experienced trial judge, requires strong medicine.  whether tavares provides adequate guidance to trial judges seeking to assess the potential effects of racial prejudice expressed in the jury room in all circumstances is something that requires fresh, principled, and rigorous reexamination.  indeed, the supreme judicial court has recently introduced a more rigorous procedure judges should follow when they are informed, after the verdict has been returned, of racially charged statements made by jurors.  see commonwealth v. mccowen,, 497 (2010) (when postverdict allegations are raised of racially charged statements by jurors, the defendant has the ""burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury were exposed to [such] statements""; if this burden is satisfied, then the commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury's exposure to the statements was not prejudicial to the defendant).and other jurisdictions have recognizedpage 570that tavares-type procedures in the preverdict context will not always suffice to grant the defendant a fair trial.  see, e.g., united states v. heller, 785 f.2d 1524, 1527 (11th cir. 1986) (after discovering that anti-semitic ""jokes"" had been made and laughed at in the jury room, a mistrial was required, even though when the judge asked each juror during a subsequent voir dire whether they could be impartial, the jurors responded in the affirmative, because ""anti-semitic 'humor' is by its very nature an expression of prejudice on the part of the maker,"" and ""[t]hose who made the anti-semitic 'jokes' at trial and those who reacted to them with 'gales of laughter' displayed the sort of bigotry that clearly denied the defendant heller the fair and impartial jury that the constitution mandates""); people v. jones, 105 ill. 2d 342, 351, 352 (1985) (after a typewritten racist ""joke"" was found in the jury room during deliberations, the judge's voir dire, in which the jurors were questioned as to whether they had seen the material and, if so, whether it would affect their deliberations, was insufficient, and a mistrial was required, because, ""[w]here black racist material is found in the jury room during the trial of an accused black man, and the material has admittedly been read by three members of an all-white jury, such circumstances are intolerable, and prejudice to defendant will be presumed"").  cf. state v. johnson, 630 n.w.2d 79, 84 (s.d. 2001) (juror's statement during voir dire that ""i got a rope,"" and the defendant was african-american, created a ""presumption of prejudice"" that the prosecution did not rebut, and a mistrial was required).  of course, whatever standard or procedure is employed, the myriad circumstances that may arise in the trial courts may render it difficult to articulate specific inquiries to be utilized in all cases.  but in light of the length of time that has passed since tavares and our keen awareness of the potential for racial bias to infect jury deliberations, we believe it would be appropriate for the supreme judicial court to consider furnishing additional guidance to trial judges seeking to assess the potential for juror taint resulting from discriminatory statements made during deliberations.nonetheless, unless and until tavares is modified by the supreme judicial court, we are bound by it, and bound to apply it.  in the present case, the judge dismissed the juror who made the racially insensitive remark and conducted an inquiry into thepage 571impartiality of the remaining jurors who heard it, concluding that they were not affected by it.  under current law as articulated in tavares, that is what was required, and the scope of the judge's inquiry did not constitute an abuse of her discretion, nor consequently was denial of the motion for a mistrial beyond the scope of that discretion.  the judgments therefore must be affirmed.so ordered.",criminal,Elizabeth M.

[578-590] vuono, concurring.","the plaintiff, michelle brown (michelle), appeals from a judgment entered in favor of the defendant, savings bank life insurance company of massachusetts (sbli or insurer), on the parties' cross motions for summary judgment.  the plaintiff's claims brought against the insurer arose from the loss of life insurance coverage for her deceased husband, daniel brown (daniel).on appeal michelleconcedes that her contract and contract-related claims were properly dismissed because they were time barred under the insurance policy, but maintains that the judge erred when he dismissed her tort and tort-related g. l. c. 93a claims on the merits.  the insurer asserts that the judge's ruling was correct not only for the substantive reasons stated by the motion judge, but because all of michelle's contract, tort, and statutory claims are barred by the limitations period in the policy requiring that claims ""on or in respect to this policy"" be filed no later than two years after her cause of action accrued.  michelle also appeals from the judge's order denying her motion to amend her complaint, and from the order denying her motion for partial summary judgment.  we affirm in part and reverse in part.page 574background.  viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, see augat, inc. v. liberty mut. ins. co.,, 120 (1991), the material facts are as follows.  michelle and her husband, daniel, purchased three life insurance policies from sbli in 2001 and 2002.  daniel's policy, in the amount of one million dollars, named michelle as the beneficiary.all three policies contained terms that stated the annual premium for the initial ten-year term would be a level premium.  at the end of the ten-year term, the premium on each policy increased significantly.  in daniel's case, the premium increased from $440 to $5,340 annually.daniel's policy and one of michelle's policies reached the end of the ten-year term on november 28, 2011.  before the end of the term, employees of the insurer called the browns' home in hopedale regarding the increase in the policy premium applicable to each policy.  the insurer, as a matter of business practice, recorded telephone calls by way of a voice-call recording system.  transcripts of several calls were included in the summary judgment record, and the content of the recorded calls is undisputed.on august 2, 2011, sbli sales agent terry melville called and left a message at the hopedale house stating ""that [michelle's] policy is going into its eleventh year in november and the premium goes through the roof when that happens and i'm sure you won't keep that policy. . . .  [t]here may be some options available with us so that you could continue coverage ongoing.  and i'd like to speak with you about those.""  michelle testified to a similar telephone call from sbli employee david wood during august or september (the 2011 conversation), in which they discussed the options available under both spouses' policies, although this call was not recorded.according to michelle, wood recommended that both michelle and daniel purchase new policies.  melville made a third call on the date the policy term ended, november 28, 2011.  in this call he left a message usingpage 575substantially the same language, and made reference to both michelle's and daniel's policies.in deposition testimony, wood acknowledged that it was sbli company policy to tell an insured to keep a policy in place until a new policy issues if the new policy is a replacement policy -- that is, a policy issued before the old policy lapses.  in this situation, sbli requires the agentto fill out a disclosure form approved by the commissioner of insurance.  see generally g. l. c. 175, § 204; 211 code mass. regs. §§ 34.00, et seq. (1995).  wood, who had been both a sales manager and a sales agent, said that it was ""the practice of the sales division to make sure that everybody keeps their insurance in force while they are going through underwriting"" because they could be refused, and ""no insurance agent would write a new contract on any client and tell them to cancel their old policy first and then apply with us.  you always want to keep the old policy, whether it's ours or somebody else's, in force while you are going through the underwriting process.""  he considered the failure to do so to be grounds for termination.daniel did not pay any portion of the $5,340 premium as of november 28, 2011, nor did he apply for a new policy before the policy lapsed.  the policy contained a thirty-day grace period, but this too passed without payment.  on january 6, 2012, the insurer sent a notice of policy lapse to daniel at the parties' home in hopedale.  the letter notified daniel that he could seek to revive the policy by filling out an application for reinstatement of coverage and returning it with the overdue premium.on january 11, 2012, wood called the brown home in hopedale regarding the policies.  at that juncture, daniel and michelle were separated (although not legally so) and daniel had moved to their summer home in sandwich.  wood spoke with michelle and reiterated that the original policy premiums jumped dramatically and that is ""why you didn't pay them,"" further stating:  ""i think when you saw the bill you probably said, 'this is crazy.'""  when michelle asked, ""what are our options [for coverage] at this point?""  wood stated, ""if you still need coverage you need to reapply for new contracts.""page 576michelle was concerned that daniel's policy had already lapsed and she was ""nervous that dan is not covered at all at this point.""  wood's response was that if she wanted to ""try to cover him now we'd have to do a reinstatement.  you'd have to pay $5,340 . . . [t]o reinstate that contract.  but i don't think you want to do that. . . .  because it'd be far cheaper for him to maybe apply for a new [ten]-year plan.""  at no time during this conversation did wood offer reinstatement of daniel's policy as an option pending approval of the new policy.  although the policy provided for installment payments, wood did not discuss with michelle whether she could make an installment payment to maintain coverage while the new application was pending, or whether any portion of the premium (in whatever amount paid) could be refunded in the event that a new policy was issued.michelle again expressed concern, telling wood, ""[l]ike i said i'm nervous that now we have nothing.""  in response, wood explained the application process and stated that daniel is ""probably going to be without insurance probably for about [thirty] days.""  michelle told wood to send an application for a new one million dollar policy for daniel.the application called for a release of medical records, and contained several questions regarding medical status.  acting on wood's instructions, michelle told daniel via electronic mail message (e-mail) about the application and an impending visit from a paramedic for a blood draw.daniel complied with all requests for medical information.  on march 14, 2012, wood spoke directly to daniel, requesting that he sign and send certain forms, and daniel complied.  reinstatement pending approval of the new policy waspage 577not mentioned.at wood's deposition, he acknowledged that the ""only way"" he could earn a commission was if daniel purchased a new policy.  wood would not have received a commission if daniel had continued his old policy.on may 2, 2012, sbli notified daniel that his application for a new term life insurance policy was denied.  although wood had promised michelle that all correspondence would be sent to her as well, the letter was addressed only to daniel at the sandwich address.  as a result, michelle was unaware of the denial until after daniel died on june 6, 2012.  under the policy, daniel was permitted to seek reinstatement of the policy for up to five years after the end of the grace period for the unpaid premium, but there was no right to reinstatement of the lapsed policy once daniel had died.on december 4, 2012, michelle wrote to the insurer asking for a claim form for daniel's death benefits, stating that she did not timely receive the notice denying daniel's application for a term life insurance policy.  the insurer responded on december 10, 2012, stating that daniel's original policy had lapsed and no new policy had issued.after an exchange of g. l. c. 93a demand letters and responses, the complaint in this action was filed on march 20, 2015, claiming:  breach of contract for failure to automatically renew the original ten-year term life insurance policy (count i); deceit (count ii); negligent supervision of employee wood (count iii); and breach of g. l. c. 93a (count iv).  in its motion for summary judgment, the insurer argued that michelle's complaint was time barred because it was brought more than two years after the policy at issue had lapsed and/or the application for a new policy had been denied.  the argument was based in part on the following language in the policy.""section 1.  policy fundamentals.. . .""time limit for filing suit""any suit brought on or in respect to this policy shall be brought against us no later than two years after the date the alleged cause of action accrues, or three years if the policy was issued in maine or rhode island.""in a memorandum of decision, the motion judge ruled that the contract claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitationspage 578contained in the policy, and that there was no deceit, negligence, or violation of the consumer protection statute as a matter of law.  the judge also denied michelle's motion to file an amended complaint, which attempted to incorporate facts learned during discovery, to refine the legal theories in light of discovery, and to state that michelle was suing both in her individual capacity and as personal representative of her husband's estate.  lastly, the judge denied michelle's cross motion for partial summary judgment, which she had premised on the proposed amended complaint.this appeal ensued.discussion.  a.  the original complaint.  we review a grant of summary judgment de novo, ""to determine 'whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'""  district attorney for the n. dist. v. school comm. of wayland,, 566 (2009), quoting from augat, inc. v. liberty mut. ins. co., 410 mass. at 120.  ""material facts are those that might affect the outcome of the suit under governing law.""  genesis technical & financial, inc. v. cast nav., llc,, 207 (2009).1.  contract claims.  as we have noted, the policy contained a clause which stated that ""[a]ny suit brought on or in respect to this policy"" must be brought within two years of accrual of the claim.  michelle acknowledged before the motion judge and on appeal that her breach of contract claim for failure to automatically renew the policy was properly dismissed.  michelle agrees that the two-year time period in the policy had already lapsed by the time suit was filed on march 20, 2015,and makes no argument that the limitations period is unenforceable as to the contract claim.  see g. l. c. 175, § 22; creative playthings franchising corp. v. reiser,, 760-761 (2012).2.  tort and consumer protection claims.  michelle's remaining claims were threefold:  (1) sbli agent wood deceived and misled her and daniel by telling her, in the 2011 conversation, to have daniel buy a new policy without telling her to continue to pay the premium on the old policy, and by failing in january, 2012, topage 579offer the option of reinstating the old policy, once lapsed, while the application for a new policy was pending; (2) sbli was negligent in its supervision of wood; and (3) sbli violated g. l. c. 93a by failing to provide mandated replacement policy notices, and/or failing to inform the browns that the policy should be maintained or reinstated while the application was pending.a.  statute of limitations.  (i) contractual limitations period.  sbli contends that because michelle's suit seeks the one million dollar policy limit in damages, all of her claims are in fact disguised contract claims, and are barred by the policy's two-year statute of limitations for suits ""on"" the contract.michelle's contract claim is that sbli breached daniel's policy because it failed to automatically renew the policy in accordance with policy renewal provisions of the policy, set out in the margin.the deceit and negligent supervision claims are based not on the contract, but on the 2011 and january and march, 2012, telephone conversations with wood.  these conversations do not form the basis of a breach of contract claim.  rather, michelle contends that wood failed to inform the insureds that they could and should either maintain (as in the case of the 2011 conversation) or reinstate (as in the january and march, 2012, conversations) the policy while the application for new coverage was pending.  the one million dollar demand is the measure of damages, but the deceit and negligent supervision causes of action sound in tort.  see, e.g., kitner v. ctw transp., inc.,, 746 (2002).kitner is instructive on this point.  in kitner, a corporation induced the plaintiff, a long-haul truck driver hired as an independent contractor, to allow his liability policy to lapse upon promise of a new policy, which was not placed.  the company then fired the driver for lack of insurance.  id. at 744.  this court observed that the plaintiff's c. 93a claim sounded in both contract and tort.  id. at 746-747.  ultimately, the jury in kitner rejected the plaintiff's breach of contract claim, but found for the plaintiff onpage 580his negligent misrepresentation claim, a fact which this court considered dispositive in characterizing the choice of law issues and the nature of the g. l. c. 93a claim.  id. at 746-747.  similarly here, the contract, tort, and c. 93a claims can and should be considered separately.  the three-year statute of limitations applies to the deceit and negligent supervision claims, and they are not time barred.as to michelle's g. l. c. 93a claim, the claim, as presented on summary judgment, is based explicitly on a theory of deceit or misrepresentation.  it therefore is not a claim ""on"" the contract, and is not time barred.  ""an action pursuant to g. l. c. 93a is 'neither wholly tortious nor wholly contractual in nature.'""  id. at 746, quoting from standard register co. v. bolton-emerson, inc.,, 548 (1995).  where the consumer protection claim under g. l. c. 93a is a statutory claim more closely resembling the tort of misrepresentation, it is treated as a tort.  see kitner, supra at 746-747.  see also standard register co., supra at 550 (""in the present case, the misrepresentations of the defendants are at the core of standard register's claim for a violation of g. l. c. 93a, § 11, thereby making it a chapter 93a claim which sounds in tort rather than contract"").  cf. schwartz v. travelers indem. co.,, 675, 677 (2001) (applying four-year statute of limitations to a c. 93a claim where ""conduct prohibited by g. l. c. 176d, and made unfair and deceptive by g. l. c. 93a, § 9, creates an action independent from the contract"").  accord hearn v. rickenbacker, 428 mich. 32, 41 (1987) (actions for fraud and negligence fall outside the policy of insurance, and contract provision barring suits ""on [the] policy"" after one year inapplicable); dunaway v. allstate ins. co., 813 n.e.2d 376, 385, 379, 387 (ind. ct. app. 2004) (policy clause providing that ""any suit or action must be brought within one year"" inapplicable to independent tort).  contrast canal elec. co. v. westinghouse elec. corp.,, 378-379 (1990).alternatively, the insurer contends that the tort and consumer protection claims are barred because the policy's two-year limitations period applies to any claim either on or ""in respect to this policy.""in creative playthings, the supreme judicial court approved a contractually shortened limitations period in a franchisee's counterclaim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent inducement, and c. 93a, where ""the claim arises under the contract, and the agreed-uponpage 581limitations period is subject to negotiation by the parties, is not otherwise limited by controlling statute, is reasonable, is not a statute of repose, and is not contrary to public policy"" (emphasis added).  463 mass. at 761, 766.  here, in contrast, as discussed above, the deceit and deceit-based statutory claims are not claims based ""on th[e] policy,"" do not ""aris[e] from [the] contract,"" id. at 759, citing albrecht v. clifford,, 717-718 (2002), and are not ""in respect to"" the policy.creative playthings also counsels that statutes of limitations found in contracts of adhesion should be approached with caution.  see 463 mass. at 763 (""any contractual reduction in a limitations period that is unreasonable or not subject to negotiation by the parties, such as in a contract of adhesion, will be unenforceable"").  an insurance contract is a contract of adhesion, which must be construed against the drafter and in favor of the insured.  see boazova v. safety ins. co.,, 350-351 (2012).  setting to one side the questions of public policy raised by a shortened limitations period, the ""on or in respect to"" language of the contract here is, at best, ambiguous.see nutter & co. v. estate of murphy,, 670 (2018).  see also acushnet co. v. beam, inc.,, 695-697 (2018) (holding the term ""with respect to"" in a stock purchase agreement is ambiguous).  ""[c]ourts in construing and applying a standardized contract seek to effectuate the reasonable expectations of the average member of the public who accepts it.""  nutter & co., supra at 670,page 582quoting from restatement (second) of contracts § 211 comment e (1981).  the language of the policy, which refers only to ""this policy,"" and appears under the heading ""policy fundamentals,"" does not put an average member of the public on notice that independent tort and tort-based consumer protection claims must be brought within two years.finally, however one might construe the contract language, imposition of a contractually shortened limitations period on tort-based consumer protection claims violates public policy.  our courts have declined to enforce contractual waivers of rights under the individual consumer protection provisions of c. 93a.""a statutory right or remedy may be waived when the waiver would not frustrate the public policies of the statute. . . .  thus, we ordinarily would not effectuate a consumer's waiver of rights under c. 93a.""  canal elec. co., 406 mass. at 377-378 (distinguishing between consumer and commercial c. 93a claims).  see garrity v. conservation commn. of hingham,, 787 (2012) (""[t]he critical consideration in deciding if a particular statute is reasonably interpreted to permit a waiver [of a time limitation] is whether doing so would frustrate the purposes and policies that statute is designed to advance""); downey v. chutehall constr. co., ltd.,, 800-801 (2016) (consumer's oral waiver of building code requirements not a defense to contractor's liability for violation of c. 93a).this conclusion is underscored by the fact that in enacting a statute of limitations for consumer claims under c. 93a, the legislature adopted progressively longer statutes of limitations.  see g. l. c. 260, § 5a.""chapter 93a claims . . . were originally subject to a two-year statute of limitations, which was extended to three years in 1973 before [g. l. c. 260,] § 5a[,] finally extended it to four years in 1975.  see baldassari v. pub. fin. trust,, [43] (1975). . . .  [section 5a was enacted] as part of a broader legislative scheme to 'remedy the imbalancepage 583which exists primarily because of a lack of parity in bargaining power between the consumer and the provider of consumer goods and services.'  mahoney v. baldwin,, [780] (1989).  the progressive lengthening of the statute of limitations, and the statutory language emphasizing the centrality of consumer protection, strongly suggest that the massachusetts legislature did not intend this limitations period to be shortened by contract.""anderson v. comcast, corp., 500 f.3d 66, 76 (1st cir. 2007).  for all these reasons, the phrase ""in respect to"" does not operate to contractually shorten the limitations period applicable to the deceit and tort-based c. 93a claims.(ii) other statutory limitations periods.  the insurer's reliance on g. l. c. 175, § 22, is also inapposite.  section 22 provides, in pertinent part:""no company and no officer or agent thereof shall make, issue or deliver any policy of insurance . . . [which] limit[s] the time for commencing actions against it to a period of less than two years from the time when the cause of action accrues.""sbli claims that this means that it can, and has, extended the two-year limitations period in the policy to tort and tort-based c. 93a claims.looking first to the ""plain statutory language,"" see dicarlo v. suffolk constr. co.,, 629 (2016), quoting from worcester v. college hill properties, llc,, 138 (2013), the language ""no company . . . shall"" is language of prohibition.  on its face, g. l. c. 175, § 22, is designed to limit (not expand) the ability of insurers to shorten the time period in which to bring claims.  see taylor, the life insurance law of massachusetts, 19 b.u. l. rev. 244, 278 (1939).  this limitation was first enacted by st. 1856, c. 252, as to domestic insurance companies, and was extended by st. 1907, c. 576, § 29, to foreign insurance companies.  taylor, supra.  these two acts abrogated cases that strictly enforced much shorter contractual limitations periods against insureds and beneficiaries who sought to recover on insurance policies.  see, e.g., amesbury v. bowditch mut. fire ins. co., 6 gray 596, 603 (1856) (four months from adverse determination); lewis v. metropolitan life ins. co., 180 mass. 317 (1902) (six months from date of death).page 584since that time, the legislature has passed ever more comprehensive insurance regulation and consumer protection legislation.  see g. l. cc. 93a, 175, 176d.  as part of that system of regulation, the legislature has chosen to expand, not contract, the time period for bringing consumer protection claims.  as the supreme judicial court observed in creative playthings, 463 mass. at 762 n.4, g. l. c. 175, § 22, constitutes legislative approval of a two-year contractual limitations period applicable to a ""claim [that] arises""  creative playthings, 463 mass. at 766 (emphasis added).the language of g. l. c. 175, § 22, can and should be read in harmony with (not in contradiction to) g. l. c. 260, §§ 2a and 5a, by applying § 22 to contract claims, § 2a to tort claims, and § 5a to tort-based c. 93a claims.  ""a statute is to be interpreted with reference to the preexisting law. . . .  if reasonably practicable, it is to be explained in conjunction with other statutes to the end that there may be an harmonious and consistent body of law.""  everett v. revere,, 589 (1962) (quotation omitted).here, reading g. l. c. 260 and g. l. c. 175, § 22, in harmony, a two-year statute of limitations applies to the contract claim and any contract-based c. 93a claims arising under the policy, the four-year statute of limitations in g. l. c. 260, § 5a, applies to michelle's tort-based consumer protection claims, and g. l. c. 260, § 2a's three-year statute of limitations is applicable to her related tort claims.b.  merits.  (i) deceit and negligent supervision claims.  the judge ruled that summary judgment was appropriate on the merits of counts ii and iii, the deceit and negligent supervision claims.  so much of these claims as were based on replacement policy notice requirements were properly dismissed.  the remainder of these claims, pertaining to the insurer's failure to advise the insureds to maintain or reinstate daniel's policy while his application for a new policy was in process, should not have been disposed of at this juncture.the complaint alleged the insurer was negligent in ""failing to assure compliance with requirements regarding advisingpage 585insureds of the risks of replacement transactions"" and with the requirements of the division of insurance.  in general, a replacement policy is one where, at a minimum, the application is initiated before the lapse of an existing life insurance policy.  211 code mass. regs. § 34.02.  see mayer v. cohen-miles ins. agency, inc.,, 442 (2000), distinguishing ellis v. william penn life assur. co. of america, 124 wash. 2d 1 (1994).  daniel's ""policy was neither 'existing' nor 'in force,' [211 code mass. regs. § 34.02,] at the time of the transaction involving the [application for or] purchase of the term insurance policy.  nor did the . . . policy lapse or otherwise terminate 'by reason of [the] transaction' involving the purchase of the term policy.""  mayer, supra at 440.  rather, the policy lapsed for nonpayment of the premium.  moreover, daniel did not initiate an application for a new policy until after the old policy had lapsed.  thus, the requirements pertaining to replacement policies were not applicable, and summary judgment regarding so much of counts ii and iii of the complaint as were based on the alleged replacement policy transactions was properly granted.  see id. at 440-442.summary judgment should not have been granted on the remaining aspects of counts ii and iii.  the judge's ruling was based, in part, on a misapprehension of what evidence could properly be considered.  see note 8, supra.  viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and taking into account all properly considered record evidence, a fact finder would be permitted to find that wood told michelle to choose between continuing the old policy at a higher premium or applying for a new policy at a lower rate.  according to wood's own testimony, it was sbli's policy to advise insureds to keep their policies in force while applying for a new one, but there is no evidence that wood did so in the 2011 conversation with michelle, before the policy lapsed.  in january, 2012, after daniel's policy lapsed, michelle expressed her concern that daniel lacked coverage and specifically asked what the options were for coverage.  wood told her that she could reinstate the policy, but presented this as an all or nothing option, and expressly advised against it.  he did not inform her that she could seek reinstatement of the old policy while the new application was pending.  nor did he address whether, if reinstated, daniel could pay a quarterly premium rather than an annual one.  nor did he discuss these options with daniel when he spoke topage 586him in march, 2012.summary judgment should have been denied for this reason.  ""[e]ven in an arms-length transaction, though there may be no duty otherwise imposed, if a party does speak 'to a given point of information, voluntarily or [otherwise], he is bound to speak honestly and to divulge all the material facts bearing upon the point that lie within his [or her] knowledge.  fragmentary information may be as misleading . . . as active misrepresentation, and half-truths may be as actionable as whole lies.""  greenleaf arms realty trust i, llc v. new boston fund, inc.,, 291-292 (2012), quoting from kannavos v. annino,, 48 (1969).  cf. glickman v. brown,, 235 (1985) (""we think it follows that sellers should not be allowed to misrepresent the truth simply because they have not made reasonable efforts to ascertain it"").the motion judge ruled as a matter of law that michelle should have known to maintain or reinstate the coverage.  this was error.  in view of the evidence that wood advised against maintaining the policy, that in the 2011 conversation, wood failed to tell michelle of the importance of maintaining coverage, and later, when asked, failed to disclose to her the option for reinstatement, it was for a jury to decide what inferences to draw from the evidence.  moreover, despite wood's promise that all notices regarding daniel's policy would be sent to michelle, the letter declining to issue a policy was not sent to michelle, effectively foreclosing any effort by her to reinstate daniel's policy before his death.while we express no view as to the ultimate merits of the parties' claims and defenses, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to michelle, merited a jury's consideration.page 587(ii)  chapter 93a.  the complaint alleged that the insurer was liable under g. l. c. 93a both for its deceit and misrepresentations, and for failure to comply with the replacement policy notice requirements set forth in 211 code mass. regs. §§ 34.00 et seq.  for the reasons stated above, so much of the c. 93a claim as was based on the replacement policy notice requirements was properly dismissed, but summary judgment should not have been granted on so much of the c. 93a claim as alleged deceit and misrepresentation.  ""[a] negligent misrepresentation of fact the truth of which is reasonably capable of ascertainment is an unfair and deceptive act or practice under g. l. c. 93a, § 2(a).""  marram v. kobrick offshore fund, ltd.,, 62 (2004), quoting from golber v. baybank valley trust co.,, 261 (1999).  glickman, 21 mass app. ct. at 235.  moreover, michelle has offered evidence that the omissions were deliberate, because wood stood to make a commission on a new policy but not the reinstatement of the old policy.  intentional misrepresentation also rises to the level of a c. 93a violation.  see giuffrida v. high country investor, inc.,, 239 (2008), citing zayre corp. v. computer sys. of america, inc.,, 570 n.23 (1987) (conscious misrepresentation may be so seriously deceptive as to permit recovery under c. 93a, § 11, where a party gave ""false assurances as to future conduct, even though the party's later actions, taken contrary to those assertions, were contractually permitted"").  this aspect of the c. 93a claim should not have been dismissed.b.  the proposed amended complaint.  michelle also appeals from the order denying her motion to amend, which order was entered after the motion for summary judgment was allowed.  a motion to amend should be granted unless there appears to be good reason for denying the motion, such as the futility of the proposed amendment.  see vakil v. vakil,, 417 (2008); lipsitt v. plaud,, 254 (2013).the denial of a motion to amend is reviewed for an abuse of discretion or error of law.  see harvard law sch. coalition for civil rights v.page 588president & fellows of harvard college,, 72 (1992).the motion judge undoubtedly considered the amendment futile as a result of his earlier ruling on the summary judgment motion.  while futility is a proper reason for denying such a motion, see lipsitt, supra, because the judge erred as a matter of law in granting summary judgment as to some of the claims, he also erred in part in denying the motion to amend.  cf. id. at 255 (""[b]ecause the factual allegations in [the] original complaint were sufficient to state a claim . . . it follows that a fortiori, [the] amended complaint, which expands on and supplements those factual allegations, is also sufficient"").  we address the viability of the amended complaint for purposes of clarity on remand.in the amended complaint michelle sued not only in her individual capacity, but also in her capacity as personal representative of daniel's estate.  the amended complaint dropped the breach of contract claim, but added other causes of action, including breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, breach of promise, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation.1.  individual claims.  with respect to the claims brought by michelle individually, the judge did not abuse his discretion or err as a matter of law in declining her motion to add claims for the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breach of promise.  the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in every contract.  anthony's pier four, inc. v. hbc assocs.,, 471 (1991).  thus, these claims are contractual in nature, and they are barred by the two-year limitations period for claims on the policy.  in any event, michelle's theory that a new and binding contract of insurance was formed by virtue of wood's january 11, 2012, telephone conversation, in which he stated that daniel was ""probably going to be without insurance probably for about [thirty] days,"" is infirm as a matter of law.  the application for a new insurance policy was just that, an application.  the record is clear that the insurer would not accept the application until daniel fulfilled certain conditions, which he was unable to do.no contract for insurance could have existed until the conditions precedent for acceptance of daniel's offer by thepage 589insurer were satisfied.  see gabbett v. connecticut gen. life ins. co.,, 435 (1939); krause v. equitable life ins. co. of iowa,, 203 (1955).turning to the tort and c. 93a claims, all claims based on the failure to provide replacement policy notice forms in violation of g. l. c. 175, § 204, and 211 code mass. regs. §§ 34.00, et seq. were futile, as were claims based on an oral contract for a new policy.  the remaining portions of the deceit, negligence, and tort-based consumer protection claims were viable, and amendment of the complaint to add these claims should have been allowed.2.  personal representative claims.  the merits of the claims brought by michelle in her capacity as personal representative must be considered separately.  for the reasons stated above, the judge did not abuse his discretion in declining to allow the addition of claims based on an oral contract for a new policy, and failure to send replacement policy notices.  however, the remaining claims brought by michelle as personal representative stand on a different footing.  among the questions to be considered is which of the claims survive daniel's death.  see g. l. c. 228, § 1; rockwell v. furness,(1913); kraft power corp. v. merrill,, 151-161 (2013); klairmont v. gainsboro restaurant, inc.,, 178-179 (2013).  contract claims survive daniel's death, as do c. 93a claims based on a breach of contract theory.  see kraft power corp., supra at 157.  the negligence and misrepresentation claims do not.  see rockwell, supra at 558-559.  our courts have yet to address the question whether the c. 93a claims based on negligence and misrepresentation survive.  see kraft power corp., supra (""we leave for another day whether claims brought under g. l. c. 93a that are not contractual nonetheless survive a party's death""); klairmont, supra at 179 (allowing noncontractual c. 93a claim to survive, but limiting holding to facts of case).as to those properly pleaded claims which survive, there is the additional question whether the extended statute of limitations for suits by executors and administrators applies.  see g. l. c. 260, § 10.  because these issues have not been addressed either here or in the trial court, we leave them for further consideration on remand.conclusion.  so much of the judgment as (a) dismisses count i of the complaint and (b) dismisses so much of counts ii, iii, and iv as allege failure to issue a replacement policy notice, is affirmed.  in all other respects, the judgment is reversed.page 590so much of the order denying the motion to amend the complaint as pertains to (a) counts vii, viii, ix, xi, and xii, and (b) so much of counts i, ii, xiii, and xiv as allege failure to issue a replacement policy notice, is affirmed.  in all other respects, the order denying the motion to amend is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.the order denying the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment is affirmed.so ordered.this case was decided on cross motions for summary judgment.  because i conclude there are genuine issues of material fact surrounding the conversations the plaintiff, michelle brown (michelle), had with savings bank life insurance company of massachusetts (sbli)'s employee, david wood, on january 11, 2012, i agree that it was error to enter

summary judgment in favor of sbli on some of the counts of the complaint, and that the judgment in favor of sbli must be reversed in part and the case remanded for further proceedings.i write separately to clarify the following points.there is no dispute that the contract claims were properly dismissed.  indeed, michelle does not appeal from that portion of the ruling on summary judgment.  each of the remaining tort claims for negligent supervision and deceit, as well as the claim based on an alleged violation of g. l. c. 93a, are based on michelle's allegation that during the january 11 telephone conversation, which occurred after the policy had lapsed, wood induced her, as the intended beneficiary, to persuade daniel brown (daniel) to obtain a new policy rather than reinstate the lapsed policy by paying the increased premiums even though daniel would remain without coverage for a period of time.put another way, michelle claims that wood's alleged failure topage 591counsel her and daniel to reinstate the lapsed policy caused her to incur one million dollars in damages.  these claims are grounded in conduct independent of the insurance policy itself and, as a result, are not barred by the policy's two-year limitations period for ""[a]ny suit brought on or in respect to this policy.""although i concur in the judgment, i note that the evidence in the record indicates that while daniel could have sought to revive the lapsed policy by paying the increased premium, doing so was ""subject to evidence of insurability.""  it is undisputed that, at the time daniel underwent a physical exam on march 9, 2012, in connection with his application for a new policy, he was no longer insurable.additionally, there is evidence demonstrating that michelle was reluctant to reinstate the lapsed policy.  michelle sent an electronic mail message (e-mail) to daniel writing:  ""here's the number to call to schedule your exam for sbli life insurance.  can you call them?  i really don't want to renew the old policy as it's 4k more money but unless you help and get this moving i may have to do that.""  there is no dispute that daniel contacted sbli and underwent the required medical examination.  but, it is not for us to assess the strengths and weaknesses of michelle's case at this juncture.  it suffices that she has alleged facts which, viewed in the light most favorable to her, entitle her to a trial.  for this reason and none other, i agree that the judgment must be reversed in part.michelle also appeals from the denial of her motion to amend her complaint.  ""the decision to grant a motion to amend falls within the motion judge's broad discretion, harvard law sch. coalition for civil rights v. president & fellows of harvard college,, 72 (1992), and we see no abuse of discretion.""  pielech v. massasoit greyhound, inc.,,page 592197-198 (2004).  similarly, i see no abuse of discretion here.  nonetheless, because this case is remanded to the superior court where, should she decide to do so, michelle may file another motion to amend her complaint, there is no reason to address the judge's ruling.",civil,Dennis J.

[596-602]","after the defendant boston public school department (bps) declined to renew her employment contract to work as a second grade teacher, the plaintiff, lisa scarlett, brought an action in two counts, alleging, inter alia, that bps violated g. l. c. 151b, § 4, by discriminating against her on the basis of her race (count i).  a superior court judge  allowed bps's motion for summary judgment and dismissed her complaint.  on appeal, we apply the familiar three-stage mcdonnell douglas paradigm for assessing an employer's motion for summary judgment with respect to an employee's claim of racial discrimination in the context of a work force reduction.  see mcdonnell douglas corp.page 594v. green, 411 u.s. 792, 802-805 (1973).  see also wheelock college v. massachusetts commn. against discrimination,, 138 (1976).  finding that scarlett met her burden under this paradigm, we reverse the judgment as to count i.background.  we briefly summarize the material facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the nonmoving party, reserving additional facts for later discussion.  sullivan v. liberty mut. ins. co.,, 35 (2005).  in november of 2009, scarlett, a black woman of jamaican descent, was hired as a full-time provisional teacher, teaching second grade in a general education classroom at the david a. ellis elementary school (ellis school), a school which is part of bps.  provisional teachers are hired under one-year contracts.  every spring, bps issues ""reasonable assurance letters"" to provisional teachers whom it intends to retain for the following school year.scarlett received a reasonable assurance letter in the spring of 2010, and her contract was renewed for the 2010-2011 school year.  again, scarlett taught second grade in a general education classroom.in october of 2010, bps entered into an interim settlement agreement with the civil rights divisions of the united states departments of justice and education regarding services provided to ""english language learner"" (ell) students.  pursuant to the settlement agreement, bps agreed to provide ell students with sheltered english immersion (sei) programs in core content classes, and also to train and to hire a sufficient number of teachers to serve ell students.in order to adequately serve its diverse student body,bps began requiring its provisional teachers either to obtain english as a second language (esl) certificationpage 595or to attend esl ""category"" trainings.in the 2010-2011 school year, the racial demographics of the student body and staff at the ellis school were as follows:as previously indicated, scarlett's race is black.  approximately forty percent of ellis school students were ell students.in february of 2011, norman townsend became principal of the ellis school, and shortly thereafter was informed that bps faced a $63 million budget shortfall for the upcoming 2011-2012 school year.  bps was required, as a result, to reduce staff.  the ellis school was no exception; townsend was forced to reduce the ellis school staff, including some provisional teachers.  in doing so, townsend prioritized maintaining the services, including the sei program,it was providing to its ell students, many of whom required services in spanish.there were seven provisional teachers, including scarlett, whose contracts were subject to nonrenewal in view of the budget shortfall:  two hispanic sei teachers (one was esl certified and the other was not, but had majored in spanish in college); three esl certified white teachers (two of whom taught sei classes and one of whom taught music); and two black teachers (scarlett and a math specialist).  scarlett and the math specialist both lacked sei teaching experience, and the math teacher also lacked esl certification.  scarlett had been working on her esl certification and received it on june 17, 2011, three days after bps informed her that her contract would not be renewed for the 2011-2012 school year.in connection with the annual ""probable organization"" meeting, during which bps administration representatives met withpage 596leadership from the ellis school to decide how properly to staff the school for the upcoming 2011-2012 school year, townsend recommended that neither scarlett nor the other black provisional teacher (the math specialist) be renewed.scarlett did not receive a reasonable assurance letter, and in june of 2011,bps informed scarlett that, due to budget constraints, her contract would not be renewed for the 2011-2012 school year.the math specialist also did not receive a reasonable assurance letter and was not renewed; his position was cut at the end of the 2010-2011 school year.procedural history.  scarlett filed a complaint with the massachusetts commission against discrimination (mcad), alleging that she was terminated because of her race or national origin in violation of g. l. c. 151b, § 4.  mcad dismissed the complaint for lack of probable cause.  scarlett then commenced the present civil action against bps in superior court.  ruling on bps's motion for summary judgment, the judge ""assume[d] that scarlett ha[d] made out a prima facie case of discrimination based on her race/color and national origin,"" but granted summary judgment in favor of bps even though scarlett had produced evidence that bps had provided ""inconsistent reasons"" for her termination.  in doing so, the judge reasoned that ""the mere existence of evidence that in some contexts may support an inference of pretext does not defeat summary judgment, if no reasonable trier of fact could find discriminatory animus when all the evidence and reasonable inferences favorable to the plaintiff are considered.""  this appeal followed.discussion.  we review the allowance of a motion for summary judgment de novo to determine whether the moving party has established that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the opposing party, ""there is no genuine issue as to any materialpage 597fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.""  bulwer v. mount auburn hosp.,, 680 (2016), quoting from premier capital, llc v. kmz, inc.,, 474 (2013).  see mass.r.civ.p. 56(c), as amended,  436 mass. 1404  (2002).  an employer seeking summary judgment in a discrimination case faces a high burden because ""the question of the employer's state of mind (discriminatory motive) is elusive and rarely is established by other than circumstantial evidence.""  sullivan, 444 mass. at 38 (quotation omitted).  accordingly, summary judgment in such cases is ""disfavored.""  ibid.general laws c. 151b, § 4, as amended by st. 1989, c. 516, § 4, provides, in pertinent part, that ""[i]t shall be an unlawful practice . . . [f]or an employer . . . because of the race [or] color . . . of any individual . . . to discharge from employment such individual . . . .""  to survive summary judgment on claims brought under this provision, an employee alleging discrimination must produce evidence from which a reasonable jury may infer ""four elements:  membership in a protected class, harm, discriminatory animus, and causation.""  lipchitz v. raytheon co.,, 502 (2001).  here, only the last two elements -- discriminatory animus and causation -- are in question.because direct evidence of these elements is rare, an employee may survive summary judgment by providing ""indirect or circumstantial evidence [of these elements] using the familiar three-stage, burden-shifting paradigm [originally set forth] in mcdonnell douglas corp. v. green, 411 u.s. [at] 802-805,"" bulwer, 473 mass. at 681 (quotation omitted), and adopted by the supreme judicial court in wheelock college, 371 mass. at 138.  at the first stage of this paradigm, the employee must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, a prima facie case of discrimination.  sullivan, 444 mass. at 40.  in a ""reduction in force case"" such as the present case,in order to meet this burden, the employee must produce evidence that (i) she is a member of a protected class; (ii) she performed her job at an acceptable level; (iii) she was terminated; and (iv) her layoff occurred in circumstances that raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.  id. at 41, 45.  if the employee is successful at establishing a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer, at the secondpage 598stage, to rebut the prima facie showing by ""articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.""  bulwer, 473 mass. at 681 (quotation omitted).  ""[a]n employer must not only give a lawful reason or reasons for its employment decision but also must produce credible evidence to show that the reason or reasons advanced were the real reasons.""  wheelock college, 371 mass. at 138.  at the third stage, the burden of production shifts back to the employee to provide evidence that the employer's stated rationale for the termination is not true but a pretext.  bulwer, 473 mass. at 681.  as the moving party, the employer ""has the burden of affirmatively demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact on every relevant issue, even if [it] would not have the burden on [the] issue [at] trial.""  sullivan, 444 mass. at 39 (quotation omitted).here, scarlett produced sufficient evidence under this framework to survive summary judgment.  starting with the first stage,bps does not dispute that scarlett produced sufficient evidence under the first three prongs of the prima facie case.  bps, however, argues that scarlett has failed to produce evidence to support a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination under the fourth prong.we disagree.""[e]vidence that a reduction in force has a disproportionate impact on members of a protected class sometimes may help establish a prima facie case of discrimination . . . .""  sullivan, 444 mass. at 46 n.16.  here, scarlett has come forward with evidence that, out of the seven provisional teachers whom townsend considered when determining which teachers to cut to meet his reduced budget, two were black.  these two teachers were the only teachers who were not renewed.  this evidence is ""sufficiently probative to allow a factfinder to believe that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff.""  id. at 44, quoting from barnes v. gencorp, inc., 896 f.2d 1457, 1466 (6th cir.), cert. denied, 498 u.s. 878 (1990).in so concluding, we are guided by the supreme judicial court's admonition in sullivan that the plaintiff's burden at thispage 599stage is ""meant to be a small showing that is easily made.""  sullivan, 444 mass. at 45 (quotation omitted).  indeed, in sullivan, the court contemplated a hypothetical situation very similar to the present case, in which a hospital employed five nursing supervisors, four of whom were women.  in implementing a reduction in force, the hospital discharged only the male supervisor.  the court concluded that ""[t]he fact that the hospital retained all women nursing supervisors and discharged the only man is sufficient, by itself, to raise a reasonable inference that the hospital selected the man for discharge because of his sex.""  id. at 44 n.14.  similarly, here, the aforementioned evidence that bps discharged the only two black provisional teachers at the ellis school suffices to raise an inference of discriminatory animus sufficient for the small showing required at this first stage of the mcdonnell douglas paradigm.bps argues that this evidence is insufficient because the five provisional teachers who were renewed were not similarly situated to scarlett; they each had skills and qualifications -- experience teaching sei classes, esl certification, or spanish language fluency -- that scarlett lacked.  this argument, however, ignores the court's statement in sullivan that ""[t]he third stage [of the mcdonnell douglas paradigm] is the more appropriate stage for the employer to establish that the plaintiff's statistical evidence is unreliable or not probative of discrimination because the statistics do not account for factors pertinent to the employer's selection process.""  sullivan, 444 mass. at 46 n.16.  see, e.g., matthews v. ocean spray cranberries, inc.,, 129-134 (1997) (analyzing at third stage whether employees were similarly situated).  accordingly, the record supports a prima facie case of racial discrimination.moving to the second stage of the mcdonnell douglas paradigm, bps articulated at least three different rationales for its decision not to renew scarlett's contract.  first, bps cited performance issues in its mcad position statement where it stated, inter alia, that ""townsend expressed some concerns with ms. scarlett's teaching performance"" and that in ""his opinion, her skills and performance were at issue.""  this performance rationale is echoed in a bps human resources document generated around the time of the probable organization meeting,and in apage 600document bps human resources sent by electronic mail message to townsend informing him that bps had followed his recommendation not to renew scarlett's contract.both of these documents include a chart in which ""performance issues"" is the reason listed for scarlett's nonrenewal.  additionally, townsend stated in his affidavit that he ""had some concerns with ms. scarlett's teaching performance.""second, bps asserted that scarlett was not renewed because she lacked esl certification.  townsend testified that this was the only basis for his recommendation not to renew scarlett's contract.  moreover, in an affidavit submitted by bps in connection with its motion for summary judgment, townsend explained that, ""[w]ithout a staff of teachers with esl licenses, it would cost more to hire additional staffers who are licensed to teach [ells].""finally, bps indicated that scarlett's contract was not renewed because she lacked spanish speaking abilities.  in its mcad position statement, bps stated, ""[t]he ability to speak a language aside from english (namely, spanish language) [is] an important job qualification.""  in his affidavit, townsend explained that each of the five provisional teachers whom he wished to retain at the ellis school had spanish speaking abilities.  he stated, ""given the high number of students who speak spanish at the ellis [s]chool along with bps's [a]cceleration [a]genda for ells during 2010-2011, i have been motivated to maintain a staff of teachers who speak spanish.""  scarlett speaks very little spanish.we turn then to the third stage of the mcdonnell douglas paradigm to determine whether scarlett has come forward with evidence upon which a reasonable jury could rely to find that bps's articulated rationales were a pretext.  here, scarlett has met her burden.  with regard to the performance rationale, bps admitted that, at the time of the probable organization meeting in february of 2011, ""scarlett's work performance did not impact bps's decision not to give her a letter of reasonable assurance.""  similarly, townsend, in his deposition, unequivocally stated thatpage 601scarlett's performance did not play any role in his nonrenewal decision.  he testified that the documents listing ""performance issues"" as the reason that scarlett was not renewed were not accurate.  in addition, in february of 2011, townsend had written about scarlett that he ""believe[d] she has a sound teaching foundation upon which to build a successful practice.""  these statements directly contradict bps's mcad position statement, townsend's affidavit in support thereof, and the internal bps human resources documents, in which bps explained that part of the rationale for not renewing scarlett was her performance.this direct evidence that one of bps's articulated rationales was false is sufficient to meet scarlett's burden at the third stage.  see, e.g., lipchitz, 434 mass. at 506-507 (at trial, employee ""was not required to disprove every reason articulated by the defendant or suggested in the evidence"" and instead could meet her burden at the third stage ""by persuading the fact finder that it was more likely than not that at least one reason was false"").beyond the direct evidence that the performance rationale was false, scarlett has come forward with evidence that calls into question the veracity of bps's other articulated rationales.  specifically, while townsend testified that the sole reason he decided not to renew scarlett was because she lacked esl certification, the record shows that at least one of the provisional teachers whose contract was renewed also lacked the esl certification.  in addition, while bps stated that scarlett was not renewed because she lacked critical spanish speaking abilities, townsend (who admitted he does not speak spanish) testified that the only reason he believed that the teacher (who lacked esl certification and was nevertheless renewed) spoke spanish was that he overheard her speaking a language that he assumed to be spanish.  he alsopage 602could not recall whether he had any knowledge of scarlett's spanish skills.on this record, scarlett has produced evidence that bps's ""facially proper reasons given for its action against [her] were not the real reasons for that action.""  verdrager v. mintz, levin, cohn, ferris, glovsky & popeo, p.c.,, 397 (2016) (quotation omitted).  significantly, ""massachusetts is a pretext only jurisdiction.""  blare v. husky injection molding sys. boston, inc.,, 443 (1995).  thus, at this third stage, the employee need only present evidence from which a reasonable jury could infer that the rationales advanced by the employer at the second stage were not the real reasons for the adverse employment action.bulwer, 473 mass. at 682.  ""[c]ombined with establishment of a prima facie case[,] a showing of pretext eliminates any legitimate explanation for the adverse hiring decision and warrants, but does not require, a determination that the plaintiff was the victim of unlawful discrimination.""  verdrager, 474 mass. at 397 (quotation omitted).  here, scarlett has produced evidence that bps provided at least one false rationale for her nonrenewal, as well as evidence from which a jury could infer that the remaining rationales proffered were also false.  coupled with her prima facie showing, that was enough to survive summary judgment.conclusion.  so much of the judgment as dismisses count ii of the complaint is affirmed.  in all other respects, the judgment is reversed.so ordered.",civil,Robert L.

[605-608]","michela devoti, the former wife (wife) of thomas m. bonaparte (husband), appeals from a divorce judgment entered in the probate and family court.  she also appeals from the order denying her motion for new trial.  her primary contention on appeal is that her motion to testify by telephone or video should have been allowed when she was unable to personally appear at trial due to immigration issues.  we agree and, with the exception of the portion of the judgment granting the divorce, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.background.  the parties were married in italy on october 2, 2005.  at that time, the husband resided in new jersey, and the wife, an italian citizen, resided in piacenza, italy.  in january of 2006, the wife gave birth to the parties' child in italy.  the parties agreed to continue living apart; however, the husband traveled to italy periodically to visit the wife and the child.page 604in the summer of 2006, the wife and the child visited the husband in new jersey, at which time the parties discussed the possibility of relocating to cape cod.  in march of 2009, the parties purchased a home located in sandwich (marital home).  one year later, in march of 2010, the wife and the child moved into the marital home with the husband.  shortly thereafter, the husband was laid off by his employer and he struggled to find work.in 2011, the wife and child returned to italy, after which time the husband was responsible for the expenses related to the marital home.  the wife was responsible for her own and the child's living expenses, and received little, if any, financial support from the husband until march of 2015, when the husband began sending the wife $100 to $150 per week.in may of 2015, the husband filed a complaint for divorce in the probate and family court.  following a pretrial conference on december 9, 2015, a judge of the probate and family court (pretrial judge) issued an order identifying the contested issues for trial as ""child support"" and ""an equitable division of assets, specifically the former marital home.""  the trial was scheduled for may 3, 2016.  nine days prior to the trial, the wife filed a motion seeking permission to testify by telephone or video.  the wife asserted she was unable to re-enter the united states until her green card status was ""regularized,"" and travel to this country was further complicated by the expiration of the child's italian passport, which could not be renewed until the husband signed ""the appropriate papers with the italian consulate.""  the pretrial judge denied the wife's motion without explanation on april 26, 2016.on may 3, 2016, the wife's counsel, the husband, and the husband's counsel appeared before a different judge (trial judge) for the first day of trial.  at the start of trial, the wife's counsel renewed the wife's request to testify by telephone or video, submitting a supporting affidavit.  the wife's counsel stated that, during a recent trip to the united states in december of 2015, federal immigration officials detained the wife for several hours and warned her that, due to an irregularity with her green card status, she would not be permitted re-entry unless she surrendered her green card or obtained a travel document.  the wife's counsel further stated that, upon returning to italy, the wife immediately began the process of obtaining the required travel document; however, it was presently ""stuck in the system.""  the trial judge denied the wife's request, observing that the wife had not soughtpage 605a continuance of the trial.  each party's counsel presented opening statements, and the husband testified.  a second day of trial was held on may 18, 2016, after which the parties submitted proposed judgments.a divorce judgment closely resembling the husband's proposed judgment entered on june 29, 2016.  the divorce judgment provided, in relevant part, that (1) the wife shall retain ownership of her real property located in italy; (2) the husband shall retain the marital home and reimburse the wife $50,000 for ""her interest in the [marital] home, after taking into consideration her sole interest"" in the italian properties and the husband's expenditures related to the marital home; and (3) the husband shall pay child support in the amount of $240 per week.  the trial judge declined the wife's request to deviate upward from the presumptive child support guidelines (2013) (guidelines) amount of $340 per week, instead deviating downward in consideration of the travel expenses (approximately $96 per week) the husband would incur to visit with the child.the trial judge further declined the wife's request for restitution for the husband's failure to support the child while the parties lived apart.  on july 13, 2016, the wife filed a motion for new trial and relief from judgment pursuant to mass. r. dom. rel. p. 59 and 60, which was denied on july 21, 2016.  the present appeal by the wife followed.discussion.  the wife claims the denial of her motion to testify by electronic means was an abuse of discretion and deprived her of due process.""due process requires, at minimum, an opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'""  brantley v. hampden div. of the probate & family ct. dept.,, 187 (2010), quoting from adoption of simone,, 39page 606(1998).  the decision whether to allow a party's request to testify by electronic means is a matter within the judge's discretion.  see mass. r. dom. rel. p. 43(a) (""in all trials the testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open court, or such other place as the judge may in his discretion determine, unless otherwise provided by these rules"").  see also adoption of edmund,, 530 (2000) (""[t]he precise method of participation should generally be left to the discretion of the trial judge"");

[617-619]","the defendant was convicted by a superior court jury of separate incidents of indecent assault and battery on three of his step-granddaughters and of one incident of rape.  during trial, a fourth alleged victim, one of the defendant's daughters, took the stand and gave some testimony that was inculpatory topage 610the defendant, but she ultimately balked and was relieved from testifying further on self-incrimination grounds.  the trial judge accordingly struck all of the daughter's testimony, instructed the jury to disregard it, and denied the defendant's motion for a mistrial.  the defendant appeals, claiming, among other grounds, that a mistrial was required because the daughter's testimony was ""ineradicable"" from the minds of the jurors.  because the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying a mistrial, and because there was no other reversible error, we affirm.1.  background.  we recite the material facts in the light most favorable to the commonwealth.  the defendant was charged,  inter alia, with multiple counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen, in violation of g. l. c. 265, § 13b, as to four separate alleged victims; the defendant was also charged with one count of rape of one of the victims.  as discussed below, while there were some factual differences in the allegations as to each victim, all accused the defendant of indecent touching beginning when they were around four years old, and continuing for many years.a.  trial testimony.  the charges as to all four victims were joined for trial, and the judge denied the defendant's motion to sever.  the sequence of trial witnesses then proceeded as follows.i.  maria.the first trial witness was maria, a victim who was nineteen years old at the time of trial.  maria testified to a number of occasions where the defendant, her step-grandfather, touched her in way that made her feel ""uncomfortable.""the first incident maria described occurred in the defendant's bedroom in his home in milford when maria was about six years old.  she stated that the defendant ""lure[d]"" her upstairs by whispering her name, and that the defendant then touched her vagina over her clothes.maria testified that the touchings continued at the defendant's home in bellingham, from when she was seven or eight years old until she was thirteen years old.  maria remembered one particular occurrence when the defendant led her into the basement, placed her up on a ledge, and rubbed her vagina over her favorite shorts, which were ruined because the defendant had motor oil on his hands.finally, maria testified that when she was a sophomore in high school, on the morning of thanksgiving she woke up to the defendant licking the right side of her ear, inserting his fingers insidepage 611her vagina, and continuously saying, ""give me your pussy.""  when maria realized what was occurring she became angry, pushed the defendant off of her, and yelled at the defendant; the defendant then left the room.ii.  karenand the motion for a mistrial.  the next witness was karen, the defendant's daughter, an alleged victim who was eighteen at the time of trial.  after answering some initial questions posed by the prosecutor, karen remained silent in response to questions regarding the defendant's conduct, as follows:prosecutor:  ""has [the defendant] ever touched you in a way that made you feel uncomfortable?""karen:  ""well, like . . .""prosecutor:  ""has he ever touched you in a sexual way that's made you feel uncomfortable?""[pause.]. . .prosecutor:  ""so, let me narrow the time frame.  prior to 2012, when you were a young child living with your father, did he ever touch you in a sexual way that made you feel uncomfortable?""[pause.]prosecutor:  ""would you like a glass of water?""[pause.]prosecutor:  ""let me withdraw that question, and ask you, [karen], how do you feel about testifying today?""karen:  ""i don't want to. . . .  because i just . . . don't feel comfortable doing this. . . .  i don't feel comfortable testifying against my own father."". . .prosecutor:  ""well, let me just ask you that question again, then:  did [the defendant] ever touch you in a sexual way that made you feel uncomfortable?""[pause.]page 612defense counsel:  ""your honor, may we approach . . . , please?""the court:  ""yes.""there were four separate pauses in this testimony, and the judge stated that each of them lasted one to one and one-half minutes.  when the prosecutor resumed questioning, karen stated that she did not remember if her father had ""touched [her] in a sexual way.""  the prosecutor then sought to refresh karen's memory by showing her grand jury testimony to her, after which karen stated that her memory was refreshed but also that she could not remember if her father had sexually abused her as a child:prosecutor:  ""after reading that, is your memory refreshed as to withhold on [sic] [the defendant] sexually assaulted you as a child?""karen:  ""yes.""prosecutor:  ""so, has your father, [the defendant], ever sexually abused you as a child?""karen:  ""i said 'yes', so -- i don't remember --""prosecutor:  ""i didn't hear you; i'm sorry, [karen].""karen:  ""i said 'i said ""yes,"" but i don't remember.'""prosecutor:  ""okay; but then i asked you if your memory was refreshed, and you said yes.""karen:  ""i said yes, but i just . . . .  i can't remember, but i said yes.""karen's testimony was then suspended.  counsel was appointed, who informed the court the following day that karen would be invoking her privilege under the fifth amendment to the united states constitution.  the judge conducted a hearing pursuant to commonwealth v. martin,, 504-505 (1996), after which he determined that karen had properly invoked her fifth amendment right and would not be compelled to testify.  the result of these actions was that karen was excused, her testimony was terminated midstream, and she was never cross-examined.the defendant moved for a mistrial.  defendant's counsel argued that the pauses in karen's testimony were ""the most prejudicialpage 613and pregnant pauses [she had] ever seen in the history of . . . trying cases.""  she argued that this prejudice was heightened because in the commonwealth's opening statement the prosecutor had previewed karen's anticipated testimony.defense counsel also pointed out that she had been unable to cross-examine karen, and that she had useful cross-examination material because karen had previously recanted to a defense investigator.  the judge denied the motion for a mistrial.  he agreed that the circumstances were ""unfortunate,"" but believed that they could not ""have been dealt with any other way than bringing [karen] up to the stand.""the judge instead addressed the situation with a curative instruction, as follows:""yesterday, you saw that [karen] was on the stand, and she is no longer going to testify.  you are to make no inference against [the defendant] as [sic] the reason for [karen's] absence.  you are to disregard [karen's] testimony in its entirety, and disregard any reference to [karen's] allegations entirely.  you may not consider any reference to [karen's] prior testimony or her demeanor while on the witness stand., and you shall not speculate as to the reason for that.  the reason was a legal ruling on my part, so you shall not speculate any further on that, and you shall not consider it at all in your deliberations.""  (emphasis supplied.)iii.  naomi and laura.following karen's appearance, both naomi and laura testified.  each of them was a step-grandchild of the defendant, as was maria, the first witness.naomi was eighteen years old at the time she testified.  she testified that the defendant began touching her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable when she was four years old, at the defendant's house in milford.  she testified to multiple instances where the defendant touched her buttocks and vagina with his hands over her clothes.  she also testified to a specific occasionpage 614when she was nine years old, in the basement of the defendant's home in bellingham, where he zipped down her jacket, stared at her breasts, and touched her vagina under her clothes with his hand.laura was fifteen years old at the time of her testimony.  laura testified that the defendant touched her multiple times in a way that made her feel uncomfortable, from when she was four years old until she was eight years old.  she also testified to two specific incidents that occurred at the home in bellingham.  one of those occurred in the defendant's bedroom.  laura testified that she found the defendant lying on his back in bed in just his underwear.  the defendant asked her to give him a hug, and when she did the defendant put his hands on her buttocks and ""made [her] move up and down on him.""b.  verdicts.  the jury found the defendant guilty, inter alia, of multiple counts of indecent assault and battery on a child, with respect to each of maria, naomi, and laura.  the jury also found the defendant guilty of rape with regard to maria.  the defendant appeals.2.  discussion.  a.  motion for a mistrial/karen's testimony.  the defendant first argues that karen's testimony and the events surrounding it were so prejudicial that a mistrial was required.  picking up on language from one of our cases, the defendant argues that despite the judge's instruction to disregard karen's testimony in its entirety, here the prejudice was ""ineradicable.""  see commonwealth v. thad t.,, 508 (2003) (""only a compelling showing of ineradicable prejudice would cause us to conclude that the judge's instructions to disregard [the witness's] testimony were inadequate"").we review the denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion.  see commonwealth v. santana,, 625 (2017), citing commonwealth v. gallagher,, 517 (1990).  the test is not whether we would have made a different decision, but whether the judge ""made 'a clear error of judgment in weighing' the [relevant] factors"" such that his decision ""falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives.""  commonwealth v. bryan,, 357 (2017), quoting from l.l. v. commonwealth,, 185 n.27 (2014).  further, ""[w]hen a jury have been exposed to inadmissible evidence, the judge may rely on a curative instruction to correct any error and to remedy any prejudice.""  commonwealth v. durand,, 668 (2016) (quotation omitted).page 615we discern no abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for a mistrial.  without doubt, karen's testimony, and the events surrounding it, needed to be addressed by the judge.   the lengthy pauses by karen, the prosecution's effort to refresh her recollection with grand jury testimony, and the fact that karen left the stand without being cross-examined certainly held the potential for unfair prejudice.  the jury could well have inferred from karen's abbreviated testimony that she had previously testified that her father had abused her, but that she no longer was willing to testify against him.  this possibility of prejudice was exacerbated because the jury had heard, in the prosecutor's opening, about some of karen's expected testimony.here, however, the trial judge acted forcefully to avert this potential prejudice.  the judge struck karen's testimony in its entirety, and instructed the jury to ""strike it from your memories as if she never testified.""  the instruction was clear and direct.  in law, karen's testimony did not exist for purposes of the defendant's trial.  ""as long as the judge's instructions are prompt and the jury do not again hear the inadmissible evidence . . . a mistrial is unnecessary.""  durand, supra, quoting from commonwealth v. garrey,, 435 (2002).the defendant argues, however, that the jury could not put the testimony out of their minds despite the judge's instruction.  but the fundamental difficulty with the defendant's contention is that it requires this court to conclude that the jury did not follow the judge's very specific instruction to disregard all of karen's testimony.  such a conclusion would be at odds with both our case law and our basic assumptions about how jurors perform their function.  jurors are presumed to follow the law as instructed.  see commonwealth v. williams,, 651 (2008) (""jurors are presumed to follow a judge's instructions, including instructions to disregard certain testimony"").  indeed, our jury system is in many ways built on this assumption -- on the structure that the judge provides the law, and that the jurors then follow that law.  see commonwealth v. leno,, 719 (1978).  ""[we] shall not assume that jurors will slight strong and precise instructions of the trial judge to disregard the matters which have been withdrawn from their consideration.""  thad t., 59 mass. app. ct. at 508, quoting from commonwealth v. gordon,, 604 (1970).indeed, the defendant has not pointed to a single massachusetts case, and we have found none, where an appellate court haspage 616concluded that a mistrial was required because the jury would not be able to disregard evidence they were instructed to disregard in its entirety.  the principal case relied upon by the defendant, commonwealth v. funches,, 292 (1979), provides him no help.  funches is relevant in that it involved a situation where, as here, a witness began testifying and provided inculpatory testimony, but then was not able to be cross-examined as to that testimony (as the witness refused to answer).  id. at 287-288.  unlike in this case, however, in funches the witness's inculpatory testimony was not struck, and the jury were never instructed to disregard it.  see id. at 287.  the testimony in funches thus was before the jury, and infected their verdict.  id. at 291-294.  funches is inapposite where, as here, the testimony was struck in its entirety during trial.the defendant also points to the decision in bruton v. united states, 391 u.s. 123, 135-137 (1968), where the united states supreme court concluded that a jury would be unable to follow a judge's instructions as to the use of evidence in a criminal trial.  while the analogy has some force, we think bruton and its line of cases are distinguishable.  bruton addressed circumstances where criminal codefendants were tried together, and where the prosecution introduced an out-of-court statement of one of the codefendants that directly inculpated the other.  id. at 124.  prior to bruton, this evidence would often be admitted, with judges instructing the jury that the out-of-court statement was admissible only against the codefendant who made the statement, while it must be disregarded as to the other defendants.  id. at 126.  bruton held that the admission of a codefendant's out-of-court statement in a joint trial, where that statement directly implicated his codefendant, violated the confrontation clause of the united states constitution; part of bruton's rationale was that the limiting instruction given to the jury was not sufficient to cure the confrontation clause issue, because the parsing required of the jury was asking too much of them.  id. at 126, 128-129.  it was in that context -- where the jury were instructed to consider the evidence against some defendants but not others -- that judge learned hand wrote that he doubted the jury could engage in the ""mental gymnastic"" required by such an instruction.  id. at 132 n.8, quoting from nash v. united states, 54 f.2d 1006, 1007 (2dpage 617cir. 1932).here, unlike in the bruton cases, the judge struck the testimony and the jury were instructed to disregard it in its entirety.  it was simply not evidence.  the judge was of course able to assess the jury when they heard karen's testimony, and when he gave his corresponding instruction to disregard that testimony.  the decision to deny the motion for a mistrial was not outside the range of reasonable outcomes on the facts here.b.  motion to sever.  the defendant next argues that the judge erred by not granting the defendant's pretrial motion to sever the charges into four separate trials, one for each victim.  the charges were joined as ""related"" under mass.r.crim.p. 9(a)(3),  378 mass. 859  (1979).  offenses are ""related"" if they are ""based on the same criminal conduct or episode or arise out of a course of criminal conduct or series of criminal episodes connected together or constituting parts of a single scheme or plan.""  rule 9(a)(1).  the purpose of the rule is to promote judicial economy and efficiency, and to avoid multiple similar trials and their concomitant burdens on witnesses and the courts.  see commonwealth v. hoppin,, 32 (1982); commonwealth v. hernandez,, 394 (2015).  related offenses accordingly ""shall"" be joined for trial unless the judge ""determines that joinder is not in the best interests of justice.""  rule 9(a)(3).our review of a judge's decision on a motion to sever is for apage 618""clear abuse of discretion.""  commonwealth v. pillai,, 180 (2005) (citation omitted).  ""[t]o prevail on a claim of misjoinder, the defendant 'bears the burden of demonstrating that the offenses were unrelated, and that prejudice from the joinder was so compelling that it prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.'""  id., quoting from commonwealth v. gaynor,, 260 (2005).there was no clear abuse of discretion here.  in considering the question, we are guided by several prior decisions of this court and the supreme judicial court that have allowed the joinder of charges involving multiple victims of sexual offenses, against a single defendant.  see, e.g., gaynor, supra at 259-263; pillai, supra at 179-184; commonwealth v. souza,, 110-112 (1995); commonwealth v. torres,, 275-276 (2014).  these cases collectively identify the factors to consider in deciding whether joinder is appropriate:  whether the victims were of similar age and gender, or shared other characteristics; the proximity in time of the assaults; and whether there were similarities in the details of the crimes -- for example, in terms of location, the manner in which the defendant gained access, or the acts themselves.the facts here fall comfortably within those cases that have allowed joinders to stand.  here, each of the victims was one of the defendant's step-grandchildren or daughters, and the abuse of each occurred within the defendant's home.  each of the victims was first assaulted at around the same age -- between four and six years old -- and for each victim the assaults were repeated over years.  and there were similarities, as well, in the defendant's behavior both leading up to and during the incidents; for example, the defendant often would find means to isolate the child victims in a room in his home (such as the basement) before beginning the assault.  similar facts are echoed in the cases that have previously upheld joinders of charges involving multiple victims of sexual assault.  see souza, 39 mass. app. ct. at 111-112; torres, 86 mass. app. ct. at 276.in determining the propriety of joinder, one important consideration is whether, if the cases were severed into trials of individual victims, the testimony of the other victims of assault nevertheless would have been admitted in each trial regarding an individual victim.  see souza, 39 mass. app. ct. at 111.  the question is material, because if the assaults on the other victims would not have been admitted in the trials of an individual victim,page 619the commonwealth should not benefit from joinder by thereby gaining the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence.we believe the testimony of each of the victims likely would have been admissible at any individual trial.  evidence of prior bad acts may not be used to show bad character or the general propensity to commit crime, but it may be admissible to prove opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, pattern of operation, or common scheme or course of conduct, as long as the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.  see commonwealth v. mazariego,, 56 (2016); mass. g. evid. § 404(b) (2018).  here, there was sufficient identity of location, time periods, relationships to the defendant, and similarities in the acts charged such that the other assault evidence likely would have been admissible to show a common pattern or course of conduct.  see commonwealth v. king,, 471-472 (1982) (evidence of prior acts of sexual abuse, forming ""temporal and schematic nexus,"" properly admitted [citation omitted]).in short, the judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to sever these cases for trial, and we discern no reversible error in the conduct of the trial, either.judgments affirmed.",criminal,Peter M.

1686,commonwealth  vs.  jonathan w. kardas.,"practice, criminal, dismissal, appeal by commonwealth.  notice, timeliness.a criminal defendant's motion to dismiss the commonwealth's appeal from the dismissal of a complaint, on the ground that a single justice of this court abused his discretion in granting the commonwealth's motion to file a late notice of appeal, was not properly before this court, where the defendant should have challenged the single justice's order by filing an appeal therefrom. [621-624]a boston municipal court judge erred in dismissing a complaint over the commonwealth's objection, where, absent a legitimate basis appearing from the record that was sanctioned by statute or rule and that did not run afoul of constitutional principles, the decision whether the prosecution of the defendant was a wise use of prosecutorial discretion belonged to the executive branch alone. [624-625]","this is an appeal by the commonwealth from the sua sponte dismissal of a complaint for trespass issued from the dorchester division of the boston municipal court (bmc).  when the defendant failed to appear for the first pretrial conference on september 21, 2016, the judge asked the prosecutor for the facts of the case.  the prosecutor summarized the police report, which indicated the charge was brought on july 15, 2016, after the homeless defendant refused to vacate his friend's residence where he had been staying temporarily.  upon hearing these facts, the judge dismissed the complaint, over the commonwealth's objection,page 621because the defendant had not ""been in any new trouble"" in the two months since the incident.more than seven months after the dismissal, the commonwealth submitted a motion to file a late notice of appeal to the single justice of this court; the motion was granted, and the defendant did not appeal therefrom.  the commonwealth argues on appeal that the bmc judge exceeded her constitutional authority when she dismissed the complaint.  rather than submitting a brief, the defendant has taken the unusual step of filing a motion to dismiss the appeal on grounds that the single justice abused his discretion when he allowed the commonwealth's motion to file a late notice of appeal.  we address the propriety of filing a motion to dismiss in the first instance in this court before turning to the merits of the commonwealth's appeal.1.  motion to dismiss.  in its broadest terms, an appeal is ""a legal proceeding by which a case is brought from a lower to a higher court for rehearing.""  webster's third new international dictionary 103 (2002).  to ensure that the appellate process is undertaken with due regard to fairness and the efficient administration of justice, certain guiding principles and procedures have been set in place.  see generally massachusetts rules of appellate procedure; tisei v. building inspector of marlborough,, 378 (1975) (""the purpose of the massachusetts rules of appellate procedure is to simplify and expedite appellate procedure"").  while these principles clearly encompass the ability to obtain review of an ""action of a single justice"" in an appellate court, mass.r.a.p. 15(c),  365 mass. 859  (1974), they also set forth specific requirements for perfecting that or any appeal.an aggrieved party must first file a notice of appeal in the court in which the order or judgment was entered and from which an appeal is being taken.  see mass.r.a.p. 3(a), as amended,  378 mass. 927  (1979) (""an appeal permitted by law from a lower court shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the lower court within the time allowed by [mass.r.a.p. 4, as amended,  430 mass. 1603  (1999)]""); mass.r.crim.p. 15(b)(1), as appearing in  422 mass. 1501  (1996) (requiring notice of appeal to be filed in trial court before pursuing interlocutory appeal); commonwealth v. cowie,, 119-120 (1989) (failure to file notice of appeal results in loss of right to direct appeal).an appeal from an order of the single justice is no different.  our rule 2:02 provides that the litigant must proceed in ""the same manner as if the single justice were the 'lower court' within thepage 622meaning"" of the massachusetts rules of appellate procedure.  in other words, a litigant must comply with the massachusetts rules of appellate procedure, which require the filing of a notice of appeal in the court in which the order or judgment appealed from was entered.  see mass.r.a.p. 3(a).  although there is a notation in rule 2:02 that it is ""[a]pplicable to civil cases,"" rule 2:02 is instructive in criminal cases; its application to criminal cases is consistent with the pervasive requirement that a civil or criminal appeal must proceed from a timely filed notice of appeal.in this case, the sole issue raised in the defendant's motion to dismiss concerns the single justice's conclusion that good cause justified the commonwealth's delay in filing its notice of appeal.  to challenge that decision, the defendant should have commenced an appeal by filing a notice of appeal.  because he did not do so, his challenge to the order of the single justice is not properly before this court.  see cowie, 404 mass. at 119-120 (direct appeal not permitted where notice of appeal not filed within permitted time period); commonwealth v. burns,, 266 (1997) (appeal dismissed because notice of appeal was filed fourteen months late, which exceeds one-year time period in which this court can extend time for filing notice of appeal).  see also commonwealth v. jordan,, 148-149 (2014) (single justice must resolve any issues related to timeliness of notice of appeal before ruling on substance of application seeking interlocutory appeal).the defendant attempts to avoid this result by arguing that in commonwealth v. linhares,(2011), we provided an alternative mechanism for obtaining review, namely by filing a motion to dismiss the appeal directly in the appellate court.  the defendant's interpretation paints the discussion in linhares with too broad a brush.in linhares, the commonwealth filed a notice of appeal in the trial court twenty days late, together with a motion for leave to extend the time to file an appeal.id. at 821-822.  after the trial judge allowed the motion to file a late notice of appeal, the defendant moved for reconsideration on grounds that the commonwealth had not established excusable neglect; the judge denied the defendant's motion.  id. at 822.  ""[t]he defendant did notpage 623appeal from the judge's allowance of the motion to file a late notice of appeal or from the denial of his motion for reconsideration; he also did not file a cross appeal or"" (emphasis added).  ibid.nevertheless, the defendant in linhares argued on appeal ""that the judge abused his discretion when he allowed the commonwealth's motion to file a late notice of appeal.""  ibid.  the defendant conceded that he had not taken any of the steps outlined above to pursue his appeal from the allowance of the commonwealth's motion to file a late notice of appeal, but claimed ""that a challenge to the lateness of an appeal is jurisdictional, and that such a challenge is appropriate at any stage of the proceeding.""  ibid.  we rejected the defendant's characterization of his claim as jurisdictional and ruled that because he had not ""properly appealed from the order allowing the motion to file a late notice of appeal or moved to dismiss the appeal, . . . the matter [was] not properly before us.""  id. at 822-823.we note that the circumstances in linhares, in which we mentioned a motion to dismiss as an avenue for challenging a trial judge's order, may be readily distinguished from those present here.  because the notice of appeal filed in linhares was only twenty days late, the deadline could be enlarged by the trial judge upon a showing of excusable neglect.  see mass.r.a.p. 4(b), as amended,  431 mass. 1601  (2001); mass.r.a.p. 4(c), as amended,  378 mass. 928  (1979).  thus, the timeliness of the notice of appeal could be and was litigated in the trial court.  in this setting, our inclusion in linhares of a motion to dismiss as a method available to the defendant to challenge a ruling of the trial judge was appropriate, because motions to dismiss are part of the everyday lexicon of the trial court, which is not true in an appellate court.here, because the notice of appeal was filed seven months late, only an appellate court or a single justice thereof was permitted to extend the time (but not beyond one year from the date the judgment or order being appealed from was entered in the trial court).  see burns, 43 mass. app. ct. at 265; mass.r.a.p. 14(b), as amended,  378 mass. 939  (1979).  rule 15(c) of the massachusetts rules of appellate procedure,  365 mass. 859  (1974), states that ""a single justice may not dismiss . . . an appeal,"" thus plainly prohibiting the application of the ""motion to dismiss"" language inpage 624linhares to a single justice matter.moreover, because the function of an appellate court is to review trial court actions, we do not view it as an appropriate venue in which to file a motion to dismiss challenging the exercise of discretion by a trial judge.  see commonwealth v. zannino,, 75 (1983) (discussing review of motion to dismiss).  for these reasons, we consider the mention of a motion to dismiss in linhares as limited to the situation presented therein, namely where the notice of appeal is not more than thirty days late and its timeliness can still be addressed in the trial court, together with any related motion to dismiss.here, because the defendant challenges the single justice's exercise of discretion, rather than raising an issue that bars the appeal from going forward, a motion to dismiss is inappropriate.the defendant should have challenged the single justice's order allowing the commonwealth's late notice of appeal by filing an appeal therefrom, and his failure to do so is fatal to his claim.2.  commonwealth's appeal.  next, we consider whether the bmc judge was permitted to dismiss a complaint over the commonwealth's objection.  ""in the context of criminal prosecutions, the executive power affords prosecutors wide discretion in deciding whether to prosecute a particular defendant, and that discretion is exclusive to them.""  commonwealth v. cheney,, 574 (2003).  ""judicial review of decisions which are within the executive discretion of the [prosecutor] would constitute an intolerable interference by the judiciary in the executive department of the government and would be in violation of art. 30 of the declaration of rights.""shepard v. attorney gen.,, 401 (1991) (quotation omitted).  ""thus, when a judge, '[w]ithoutpage 625any legal basis . . . preempt[s] the commonwealth's presentation of its case [t]hat action effectively usurp[s] the decision-making authority constitutionally allocated to the executive branch.'""  cheney, 440 mass. at 574, quoting from commonwealth v. gordon,, 501 (1991).  ""pretrial dismissal, over the commonwealth's objection, of a valid complaint or indictment before a verdict, finding, or plea, and without an evidentiary hearing basically quashes or enters a nolle prosequi of the complaint or indictment.""  commonwealth v. pellegrini,, 404 (1993).  ""[t]he decision to nol pros a criminal case is within the discretion of the executive branch of government, free from judicial intervention.""  gordon, 410 mass. at 500.in this case, the judge appeared to dismiss the complaint against the defendant because she did not believe it was a case that should be prosecuted.  this belief is not a sound basis upon which to dismiss the complaint.  see commonwealth v. morgan,, 780 (2017) (""in the absence of a legal basis to do so, it is well established that a judge may not dismiss a valid complaint over the commonwealth's objection"").  in addition, the defendant did not file a motion under mass.r.crim.p. 13(c), as appearing in  442 mass. 1516  (2004), or under any other rule, asserting any ground for dismissal, and the judge did not identify any legal ground for dismissing the complaint.  absent a legitimate basis that appears from the record, that is sanctioned by statute or rule, and that does not run afoul of constitutional principles, the decision regarding whether the prosecution of the defendant is a wise use of prosecutorial discretion belongs to the executive branch alone, and the judge erred in usurping that authority.  see and contrast morgan, 476 mass. at 776-781.order dismissing complaint reversed.",criminal,Lisa A.

[630-632]","in this zoning appeal, we must decide whether the trial judge could determine sua sponte that a direct abutter's presumptive standing was rebutted where the defendants did notpage 627press the issue at trial.  we conclude that the judge properly reached the question and affirm the judgment of dismissal.background.  the defendants carleton j. buckley and heidi pihl-buckley (collectively, the buckleys) reside at 30 nixon road, framingham, in a converted barn located on the same lot as heidi's parents' single-family home.the barn was constructed in 1971 and used as a horse stable and then as storage for heidi's father's business.  in the mid-1980s, the barn was converted into a residence without any permits authorizing the renovation.  the buckleys, who have owned the parcel since 2009, have resided in the converted barn since the mid- to late-1980s and reared their now-adult children there.  in 2004, heidi's father applied for a building permit to construct a twelve foot by twenty-four foot addition onto the barn to serve as a ""great room.""  the permit was granted and the addition was built.the plaintiff, robert d. talmo, owns 28 nixon road, which directly abuts the buckleys' property.  in 2009, talmo sought zoning enforcement from framingham's building commissioner (see g. l. c. 40a, § 7), requesting that the buckleys be ordered to cease using the converted barn as a residence.  the building commissioner denied the request, and talmo appealed to the zoning board of appeals (the board).  the board reversed the building commissioner's decision, and ordered him to take all action necessary to enforce framingham's zoning by-law.thereafter, the buckleys filed an application for a building permit seeking to convert the barn into ""additional living space for main house.  not to be used as a separate dwelling.  not to include permanent provisions for cooking.""  a permit issued on june 17, 2010.the buckleys then removed their stove and oven from the barn's kitchen and had the stove connection capped.on october 18, 2010, talmo initiated a second zoning enforcementpage 628action.  the building commissioner again denied his request for relief, taking the position that the converted barn could no longer be considered a dwelling unit for purposes of the by-law because the cooking facilities had been removed, making the building a permissible ""accessory use.""  talmo appealed and the board denied talmo relief.  he appealed that decision to the land court.the case was tried to a land court judge on december 8, 2015, and the judge took a view the next day.  in his decision, the judge did not reach the substance of talmo's argument that the board exceeded its authority in upholding the building commissioner's determination that the converted barn now qualifies as a permissible accessory use.  instead, he found that talmo's presumed ""aggrieved person"" standing as a direct abutter to the buckleys' property was rebutted by evidence presented at trial.  see 81 spooner rd., llc v. zoning bd. of appeals of brookline,, 700 (2012).  the judge relied on talmo's own testimony and evidence about the distance between talmo's home and the converted barn and on partial screening of talmo's view of the barn.  since talmo offered no specific evidence of particularized harm in the face of this evidence, the judge found talmo lacked standing and entered a judgment dismissing the case.talmo filed a motion for new trial.  the judge allowed the motion in part, reopening the trial on the issue of standing.  talmo then offered evidence related to alleged contamination of his drinking water well, on the theory that the contamination was caused by the existence of a second septic system on the buckleys' property.  the judge found that talmo's evidence was insufficient to show that he is aggrieved by the board's decision, and declined to alter the prior judgment.  this appeal followed.discussion.  1.  rebuttal of presumption.  ""under the zoning act, g. l. c. 40a, 'only a ""person aggrieved"" has standing to challenge a decision of a zoning board of appeals.' g. l. c. 40a, § 17.""  81 spooner rd., 461 mass. at 700.  abutters are, however, ""entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are 'aggrieved.'""  ibid.  see g. l. c. 40a, §§ 11, 15, 17; marotta v. board of appeals of revere,, 204 (1957); watros v. greater lynn mental health & retardation assn.,, 110-111 (1995).a rebuttable presumption ""continues only until evidence has been introduced which would warrant a finding contrary to the presumed fact.""  scaltreto v. shea,, 64 (1967).  seepage 629jacquot v. wm. filene's sons co.,, 316 (1958) (presumption favoring plaintiff disappeared based on her own testimony); potter v. john bean div. of food mach. & chem. corp.,, 425 n.1 (1962); standerwick v. zoning bd. of appeals of andover,, 34 (2006); 81 spooner rd., 461 mass. at 702.  thus, in the zoning context, the standing ""presumption recedes when a defendant challenges the plaintiff's status as an aggrieved person and offers evidence supporting his or her challenge.""  watros, 421 mass. at 111.here, the judge found that talmo's presumption of aggrievement was rebutted by evidence introduced by talmo, amplified by the judge's view.  although the defendants asserted lack of standing as an affirmative defense in their answers, they never claimed at trial that talmo lacked standing, and talmo argues that the judge was not permitted to reach the issue on his own.talmo's standing, however, was a ""jurisdictional"" prerequisite to proceeding with the case in the sense that his status as an aggrieved person is an essential prerequisite to judicial review.  see watros, 421 mass. at 107; 81 spooner rd., 461 mass. at 700 n.12; nickerson v. zoning bd. of appeals,, 681 n.2 (2002).  as such, it was properly reached by the judge sua sponte.  see rental property mgmt. servs. v. hatcher,, 547 (2018), quoting from nature church v. assessors of belchertown,, 812 (1981) (""[w]henever a problem of subject matter jurisdiction becomes apparent to a court, the court has 'both the power and the obligation' to resolve it, 'regardless [of] whether the issue is raised by the parties'"").  see also litton bus. sys., inc. v. commissioner of rev.,, 622 (1981); prudential-bache sec., inc. v. commissioner of rev.,, 248 (1992).there being no impediment to the judge's reaching the issue, his factual determination that the evidence warranted a finding contrary to the presumption is reviewed for clear error.  see murray v. board of appeals of barnstable,, 476 (1986).  we see no error here.  the judge found based on testimony, photographs admitted in evidence, and his viewthat the converted barn is not in close proximity to, and cannot clearlypage 630be seen from, talmo's house.  specifically, the judge found that talmo's house is located in excess of 250 feet from the buckleys' converted barn, confirming talmo's testimony as to the ""substantial"" distance between the two properties.  the judge also found that trees, boulders, and other landscaping partially obscure the view of the barn from talmo's property and that ""[t]he distance between the two houses is great enough that it is virtually inconceivable that traffic, noise or light from the former barn, now occupied as a residence, could disturb or injure talmo in the use of his property, and there was no evidence to suggest otherwise.""  the available evidence was sufficient to rebut the presumption of standing.the case before us might be more difficult had talmo not been given notice of the issue and an opportunity to introduce countervailing evidence of his aggrievement once the judge determined sua sponte that the presumption was rebutted.  certainly, the better practice would have been to alert the parties that the judge was concerned that talmo's presumptive standing had receded in light of evidence presented at trial, and invite the parties to offer evidence and possibly briefing on the issue prior to the entry of judgment.  however, where, as here, the judge reopened the trial as to the standing issue upon talmo's motion, we see no procedural or factual error, nor abuse of discretion, in the judge's determination that the presumption was rebutted.2.  factual determination on reopened evidence.  once the presumption of standing has been rebutted, whether an abutter qualifies as an aggrieved person ""will be decided on the basis of all the evidence, with no benefit to the plaintiff from the presumption of aggrievement.""  81 spooner rd., 461 mass. at 701.  thus, we now turn to the judge's finding, based on the evidence entered upon reopening the trial, that talmo lacks aggrieved person status.  ""in this context, standing becomes, then, essentially a question of fact for the trial judge,"" marashlian v. zoning bd. of appeals of newburyport,, 721 (1996), and the judge's determination will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.  kenner v. zoning bd. of appeals of chatham,, 119 (2011).page 631a person is ""'aggrieved' if he suffers some infringement of his legal rights.""  marashlian, 421 mass. at 721.  ""the injury must be more than speculative,"" ibid., and also must be ""special and different from the concerns of the rest of the community.""  standerwick, 447 mass. at 33, quoting from barvenik v. board of aldermen of newton,, 131, 132 (1992).  kenner, 459 mass. at 120 (plaintiffs had burden of showing they suffered ""particularized injury"" as result of alleged zoning infraction).  ""aggrievement requires a showing of more than minimal or slightly appreciable harm.""81 spooner rd., 461 mass. at 700, quoting from kenner, 459 mass. at 121.during the reopened trial, talmo's sole basis for asserting particularized injury was alleged contamination of his drinking water well.the judge found, however, that the amount of nitrates and nitrites detected in talmo's well was so far below the level of contamination permissible under federal regulations that any contamination did not constitute a specific cognizable injury.  moreover, even if there were an injurious level of contamination, the judge found that the evidence was insufficient to establish a nexus between that contamination and the septic systems on the buckleys' property.to prove aggrieved person status, the plaintiff in a zoning appeal ""must put forth credible evidence to substantiate his allegations"" of particularized or special injury, with ""credible evidence"" being comprised of both quantitative and qualitative components.page 632butler v. waltham,, 441 (2005).  ""quantitatively, the evidence must provide specific factual support for each of the claims of particularized injury the plaintiff has made.""  ibid.  ""qualitatively, the evidence must be of a type on which a reasonable person could rely to conclude that the claimed injury likely will flow from the board's actions.""  ibid.  having reviewed the record, we see no error in the judge's factual findings.  here, where the measured level of contaminants was so low in comparison to federal safety standards and evidence that any existing contamination could be traced to the buckleys' property was lacking, talmo's evidence of particularized injury fell short of the ""credible evidence"" standard.judgment affirmed.",civil,Howard P.

[636-642]a boston municipal court judge did not err in denying a criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained by police through a warrantless search of her motor vehicle, leading to the discovery of a loaded firearm in the trunk, where the defendant's statements, overheard by police conducting a wiretap of a telephone line pursuant to a federal order, furnished ample objective grounds, in no way weakened by the discovery of a stun gun in the defendant's handbag, to believe that the defendant possessed and was prepared to use a loaded firearm, and that it was somewhere in her motor vehicle. [642-643]","before us is the defendant's interlocutory appealfrom the denial of her motions to suppress evidence obtained by police through (1) warrantless real-time tracking of the defendant's whereabouts using cell site location information (csli) and (2) a warrantless search of her motor vehicle, leading to the discovery of a loaded firearm and a stun gun.we affirm.background.  we recite the relevant facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented where necessary by uncontroverted police testimony, which the judge expressly credited in full.  see commonwealth v. isaiah i.,, 337 (2007), s.c.,(2008).  none of the judge's subsidiary findings is challenged on appeal.in april, 2015, as part of a joint investigation with federal authorities, the boston police were conducting a wiretap of the telephone line of one mike coke pursuant to a federal court order.at approximately 4:30 p.m. on april 14, 2015, an officer in the ""wire room"" was monitoring a call from coke to an unidentified woman, and he heard her say:  ""i'm about to go shoot up this nigga right now, i'm going to get the fucking gun, i'm sick of this bitch ass nigga yo.  he fucking took my fucking money and don't want to give it the fuck back.  i'm going to his, i'm going right there, right now.  right fucking now, by my fucking self . . . .""  the judge, who listened to a recording of the call, found that she sounded ""angry, upset, and emotional.""  the wire room officer found the call ""alarming"" in that the woman on the call ""intended to use a firearm to shoot someone.""  he checked her telephone number in various databases and identified her as the defendant.the police then knew that the defendant was referring to alvin dorsey, with whom she had been in ""some type of romantic relationship.""  the judge found that ""the police were reasonable inpage 635having grave concerns about the defendant imminently causing serious bodily harm.""within fifteen minutes of hearing the defendant's threat, the officer called at&t to initiate an ""exigent request.""  he stated that the boston police had reliable information that a person using an at&t cellular telephone (cell phone) might have a gun and might be about to harm another person.  he provided the defendant's cell phone number and asked at&t to perform ""emergency pings"" and give the police real-time csli about the approximate location of the defendant's cell phone.at&t agreed to assist, and it began sending the results of the pings to a designated boston police electronic mail (e-mail) address at approximately fifteen-minute intervals.  the officer mapped the location of each ping result as it was received and shared this information with officers in the field attempting to find the defendant.the first result, received at 5:06 p.m., showed the cell phone within a 1,880 meter radius of a cell site in braintree.  subsequent results showed the cell phone to be moving toward boston, leading police to believe that the defendant was on her way to locate dorsey.  specifically, a 5:37 p.m. result showed the cell phone somewhere in the dorchester section of boston, and a 5:53 p.m. result showed the cell phone in the roxbury section of boston, within a 652-meter radius of a cell site atop a food market.  in the meantime, police had learned that dorsey ""may have been"" with a girl friend who lived at a particular address in a housing project near that market.  results received at 6:25 p.m. and 6:41 p.m. showed the cell phone in an area with a 487-meter radius that included that housing project.at 6:46 p.m., the officer in the wire room, still monitoring coke's phone calls, listened to a second conversation between coke and the defendant.  in this call, the defendant said, ""i'm sitting right in front of her house,"" which the police knew referred to the house of dorsey's girl friend.  the defendant further stated that she was going to ""shoot him and his bitch in the face""; that she knew dorsey was in the apartment because he had been texting her; that she was waiting for him; that if he did not come out, she would be back at 7:00 a.m. in a motor vehicle that he would not recognize; and that she would jump out and ""pistol whip"" him.  she added that if dorsey sent anyone to attack her, itpage 636would be a ""firefight,"" which the detective understood to mean a ""shootout.""at this time, a boston police sergeant, who had been kept informed of the defendant's threats and suspected location, was in a motor vehicle near the market and the housing project.  at approximately 6:50 p.m., the sergeant turned onto the street where dorsey's girl friend lived and observed a woman sitting in a motor vehicle parked about 100 yards away from, and with a clear line of sight to, the girl friend's residence.  the woman was talking on a cell phone.  the sergeant knew that the defendant was on the phone with coke at the time.the sergeant called in the motor vehicle's license plate number and learned that the vehicle was registered to the defendant.  the sergeant then contacted a boston police detective who, along with two other officers, was patrolling the area in an unmarked cruiser.  the sergeant described the defendant, her vehicle, and its plate number and location; warned the detective that the defendant likely had a firearm and was threatening to shoot someone; and asked the detective to stop the defendant's vehicle.the three officers stopped and approached the defendant's motor vehicle on foot.  the detective then asked her for her license and registration.  when she said she did not have a license, she was ordered out of the vehicle and arrested for operating without a license.  one officer led her to the rear of the vehicle, while the others searched the vehicle.  they found a stun gun in the defendant's purse in the passenger compartment and a loaded gun in the trunk.the defendant filed separate motions to suppress the fruits of (1) the warrantless csli search of her location and (2) the warrantless search of her motor vehicle.  the judge ruled that the csli search was justified under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, because the police had a ""good faith, reasonable belief that there was a serious and imminent threat to human life.""  the judge further ruled that the search of the vehicle was justified under the automobile exception, where the police had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained a loaded firearm that the defendant intended to use.discussion.  in reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge's subsidiary findings unless clearly erroneous, see commonwealth v. white,, 137 (1977), aff'd, 439 u.s. 280 (1978), and make an ""independent determination on the correctness of the judge's 'application of constitutional principlespage 637to the facts as found.'""  commonwealth v. haas,, 550 (1977), quoting from brewer v. williams, 430 u.s. 387, 403 (1977).1.  csli search.  the parties and the judge proceeded on the assumption that the police use of the csli voluntarily provided by at&t, in order to track the defendant's location in real time for two hours, was a search, subject to the warrant requirement of art. 14 of the massachusetts declaration of rights.compare commonwealth v. augustine,, 255 (2014), s.c.,(2015) (""[t]he government-compelled production of the defendant's [historical] csli records [covering two weeks] by sprint constituted a search in the constitutional sense to which the warrant requirement of art. 14 applied""); commonwealth v. fredericq,, 27-28 (2018) (government-compelled creation and production of real-time csli for more than six days was subject to art. 14 warrant requirement).  without deciding the question, we proceed on the same assumption.and, as neither the supreme judicial court nor this court has previously determined whether an emergency might justify a warrantless csli search, we begin by reviewing emergency search cases from other contexts.a.  the emergency aid exception.  in the context of a search of a home, where constitutional protection against unreasonable searches is at its zenith,the courts have recognized an ""emergency aid"" exception to the warrant and probable cause requirementspage 638of the federal and state constitutions.see commonwealth v. snell,, 774-775, 776 n.7, cert. denied, 527 u.s. 1010 (1999); commonwealth v. duncan,, 749-750, cert. denied, 135 s. ct. 224 (2014); commonwealth v. cantelli,, 165 (2013).  ""this exception 'permits the police to enter a home without a warrant when they have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that there may be someone inside who is injured or in imminent danger of physical harm.'""  duncan, 467 mass. at 749-750, quoting from commonwealth v. peters,, 819 (2009).  ""the need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.""snell, 428 mass. at 774, quoting from commonwealth v. bates,, 219 (1990).  see brigham city v. stuart, 547 u.s. 398, 403 (2006).  ""the reason is plain:  'people could well die in emergencies if police tried to act with the calm deliberation associated with the judicial process.'""  commonwealth v. ringgard,, 201 (2008), quoting from wayne v. united states, 318 f.2d 205, 212 (d.c. cir.), cert. denied, 375 u.s. 860 (1963).in such cases, probable cause is not required, ""because the purpose of police entry is not to investigate criminal activity. . . .  instead, a warrantless entry 'must meet two strict requirements.  first, there must be objectively reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency exists. . . .  second, the conduct of the police following the entry must be reasonable under the circumstances . . . .'""  duncan, 467 mass. at 750, quoting from peters, 453 mass. at 823.  the burden of showing reasonableness is on the commonwealth.  cantelli, 83 mass. app. ct. at 167.""the injury sought to be avoided must be immediate and serious, and the mere existence of a potentially harmful circumstancepage 639is not sufficient.""  commonwealth v. kirschner,, 841-842 (2006).  but neither is ""ironclad proof of 'a likely serious, life-threatening' injury"" required.  commonwealth v. entwistle,, 214 (2012), cert. denied, 568 u.s. 1129 (2013), quoting from michigan v. fisher, 558 u.s. 45, 49 (2009).  ""it suffices that there are objectively reasonable grounds to believe that emergency aid might be needed.""  entwistle, supra.""[w]hether an [emergency] existed, and whether the response of the police was reasonable and therefore lawful, are matters to be evaluated in relation to the scene as it could appear to the officers at the time, not as it may seem to a scholar after the event with the benefit of leisured retrospective analysis.""  commonwealth v. young,, 456 (1981).  what matters are the objective circumstances known to police officers; their subjective motives are irrelevant.  entwistle, 463 mass. at 214.thus, in snell, the court upheld a warrantless entry into the defendant's house because ""[t]here existed objectively reasonable grounds to believe that [the defendant's wife] might be injured or dead inside,"" presenting a domestic violence situation, ""which often calls for rapid police response designed to prevent further injury to a victim, to see whether a threat against a victim has been carried out, or to ascertain whether some other grave misfortune has befallen a victim.""  428 mass. at 775.  and in cantelli, we upheld a warrantless police entry into the defendant's apartment to allow a technician to turn off the gas supply to the defendant's stove, where his prior erratic conduct in allowing ""explosive levels"" of gas to fill his apartment, and in refusing entry to the technician, presented ""an emergency of sufficient proportions . . . to render a warrantless entry reasonable.""  83 mass. app. ct. at 165-166.the emergency aid exception also applies to searches within lawfully-entered homes.  in commonwealth v. samuel,(2011), the police, after entering an apartment with a resident's consent, searched under a pillow where they reasonably believed the defendant had hidden a loaded firearm.  the defendant had earlier told others that he would use the firearm in a killing for hire.  we upheld the search under the emergency aid exception.  id. at 562-564.other decisions have applied the exception to uphold warrantless searches of places other than homes, in order to find and assist a victim of serious physical harm or to prevent such harm from occurring.  see commonwealth v. marchione,, 11-12page 640(1981) (search of commercial premises where there was reason to believe explosive liquid was stored in partially-open containers near homemade incendiary device); commonwealth v. ortiz,, 572-573 (2002) (search of fruit store to find missing person who police reasonably believed was inside and injured or dead); commonwealth v. dimarzio,, 747-750 (2001), s.c.,(2002) (police entry into warehouse office to find angry, intoxicated man who had just threatened to come to couple's house with shotgun); commonwealth v. mccarthy,, 594-595 (2008) (search of handbag of woman who collapsed in public of apparent drug overdose, to find type of drug she might have ingested in order to assist medical personnel in treating her).we mention two other cases that illustrate the reach of the emergency aid exception.  in duncan, the court extended the exception to protect nonhuman animal life.  467 mass. at 753.  and in commonwealth v. hurd,(1990), we applied the exception to uphold police officers' stop of a motor vehicle with new hampshire license plates approaching the entrance to a highway, based on an anonymous tip that the driver was intoxicated and had three small children with him.

rather, she argues only that the exception's requirements were not met here.  therefore, assuming without deciding that this was a search, we will also assume without deciding that it would have been permissible if the exception's requirements were met.accordingly, we examine whether the commonwealth has met its ""burden of showingpage 641that authorities had a reasonable ground to believe that an emergency existed and that the actions of the police were reasonable in the circumstances.""  commonwealth v. knowles,, 96 (2008).we have no difficulty concluding that these standards were met here.  the police overheard a phone call in which an angry, upset individual said she was ""going to get the . . . gun"" and was ""about to go shoot up [someone] right now . . . .  i'm going to his, i'm going right there, right now.""  the police identified the person making the threat as the defendant and thus inferred that she was likely talking about shooting dorsey.  the judge, after listening to a recording of the call, found that ""the police were reasonable in having grave concerns about the defendant imminently causing serious bodily harm,"" and we see no basis for rejecting that finding.  see dimarzio, 52 mass. app. ct. at 747-751 (emergency aid exception applied where police reasonably believed that angry, intoxicated person had just threatened to come to couple's house with shotgun); samuel, 80 mass. app. ct. at 563-564 (exception applied where police reasonably believed that person had concealed loaded gun under pillow and announced that he had been hired to kill someone).  although the defendant here argues that the police had no basis other than her own statement for believing she had access to a firearm, such a statement was found sufficient in dimarzio, 52 mass. app. ct. at 748-749, and it was sufficient here.what police did not know here, at the time of the call, was the whereabouts of the defendant.  in the circumstances, it was objectively reasonable for the police to request real-time csli, in order to determine the defendant's current location and the direction in which she was moving, and thus to find and intercept her before she could shoot dorsey.the defendant points out that when at&t, in response to the ""exigency request,"" sent the police her subscriber information as well her real-time csli information, the police learned her home address in braintree.  she argues that at that point, the police could have asked their counterparts in braintree to look for her at her home, instead of tracking her using csli.  but this ignores, among other factors, that the police had no information suggesting that she was actually at her home or would still be there whenpage 642police arrived.  indeed, the police had just heard her say that she was ""going to get the . . . gun"" and ""going to his . . . going right there, right now"" to shoot the intended victim, thus indicating that she was leaving wherever she was and going to wherever she believed dorsey was.  the defendant's second-guessing approach contravenes the principle that the reasonableness of the police response is ""to be evaluated in relation to the scene as it could appear to the officers at the time . . . .""  young, 382 mass. at 456.the same is true of the defendant's argument that the police, once they formed a belief that her target was dorsey and that he might be at his girl friend's address, could simply have gone to that address instead of tracking her using csli.  even assuming (although the record does not show it) that the police formed this belief about dorsey's whereabouts before they obtained any csli, their belief was merely that dorsey ""may have been"" at that address.  it was reasonable for the police to believe that a more direct and sure way of preventing the defendant from shooting dorsey was to find and intercept the defendant herself.  see dimarzio, 52 mass. app. ct. at 748 (where defendant left couple's house but threatened to return with a shotgun, ""[i]t was reasonable for the police to go looking for the defendant to gather further information"").the defendant makes no other argument that the police lacked reasonable ground to believe that an emergency existed or that their actions were unreasonable in the circumstances.  the police tracked her location using csli for a brief period, apparently not exceeding two hours, and intercepted her immediately after hearing her say, in a second phone call, that she was ""sitting right in front of [the girl friend's] house,"" and was going to ""shoot him and his bitch in the face.""  we conclude that the police use of the csli voluntarily provided by at&t, assuming without deciding that it was a search that could in principle be justified by the emergency aid exception, was justified on these facts.2.  search of motor vehicle.  the judge upheld the search of the defendant's motor vehicle based on the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.that exception ""applies to situations where the police have probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle parked in a public place and apparently capable of beingpage 643moved contains contraband or evidence of a crime.""  commonwealth v. dame,, 536 (quotation omitted), cert. denied, 137 s. ct. 132 (2016).  the exception extends to a vehicle's trunk, if the item(s) sought may reasonably be thought to be there.  see commonwealth v. garden,, 51-52 (2008); commonwealth v. hernandez,, 383-384 (2015).  the judge here concluded that police had probable cause to believe that ""the defendant's car contained a loaded firearm and that she intended to use it.""on appeal the defendant argues that the automobile exception was inapplicable only because the police lacked probable cause to search the trunk for a gun.she contends that, although her statements to coke gave reason to ""suspect that she was carrying a gun, . . . once the stun gun was located in [her] purse, the force of those statements as evidence that she had some other type of gun was greatly diluted"" and fell below the level of probable cause.even assuming that the stun gun was found first (an issue on which the evidence was unclear and the judge made no finding), we disagree.  the defendant stated in the first call that she was going to ""get the fucking gun"" and ""shoot up"" the intended victim.  she stated in the second call, from outside his girl friend's residence, that she was going to ""shoot him and his bitch in the face,"" that she was prepared to ""pistol whip"" him, and that if he sent anyone to attack her, it would be a ""firefight.""  these statements furnished ample objective grounds -- in no way weakened by the discovery of a stun gun in her handbag -- to believe that the defendant possessed and was prepared to use a loaded firearm, and that it was somewhere in the motor vehicle.order denying motions to

[652-654]","this is a dispute between inland and shoreland owners over rights to use a particular beach in dennis.  the sixty-nine plaintiffs (inland owners) claim the right to use the intertidal beach area that lies seaward of lots owned by the thirty-four defendants (shoreland owners).  all of the lots are registered land that originally was part of a 217-acre tract adjacent to cape cod bay that was subdivided over the course of the last century.  on motions for summary judgment, a land courtpage 646judge ruled in the shoreland owners' favor, concluding that they owned the contested portions of the beach (disputed flats), and that the inland owners' rights to use the disputed flats were limited to those public rights reserved by the colonial ordinance of 1641-1647.   see michaelson v. silver beach improvement assn., inc.,, 253 (1961) (although land in intertidal zone generally is privately held, it is subject to certain reserved public rights, typically summarized as fishing, fowling, and navigation).  the judge explained his ruling in a thoughtful and comprehensive forty-page decision.  we affirm the judgment, while clarifying one ambiguity in it.background.  as an initial matter, we note that the current case is a follow-up to hickey v. pathways assn., inc.,(2015) (hickey i).  that case was a dispute over hickey way, a twenty-foot wide right-of-way that runs from shore drive to cape cod bay in dennis.  id. at 736.  the four shoreland owners who owned the lots abutting hickey way brought that case seeking to establish that they held the fee interest in hickey way and that the inland owners had no right to use it.  id. at 737.  the supreme judicial court ruled in favor of the inland owners.  specifically, the court held that the original developers had retained the fee to hickey way and had granted the inland owners rights to use that way.  id. at 753, 761.fresh from their victory securing their rights to use hickey way, the inland owners brought the current case seeking to establish their right to use the disputed flats for all normal beach purposes (not just for the reserved public rights of fishing, fowling, and navigation).  as the judge aptly put it, ""having been adjudged to hold rights in . . . hickey way, [the inland owners] now seek a ruling as to the scope of their rights in the area accessed by that way.""we turn next to a summary of the undisputed subsidiary facts.  the original 217-acre tract was registered in 1903 to frank b. tobey.  it subsequently was developed in stages, as depicted in various land court plans.the eastern portion of the tobey tract -- depicted on the so-called ""b plan""-- was developed first.  although the current litigation does not directly involve any ofpage 647the b plan lots, the development of that area serves as a useful point of comparison.  along the water in that area was a long but narrow upland beach that was set aside as a separate lot (beach lot b-e).  the b plan lots were developed so that there would be access ways that ran to beach lot b-e from a road that paralleled the water (with the access ways spaced every few lots).  the deeds to the fourteen lots shown on the b plan that lie just to the south of beach lot b-e describe their northern boundary variously as ""by the beach,"" by specific reference to beach lot b-e, or both.the current litigation involves the western portion of the tobey tract.  as the court observed in hickey i, 472 mass. at 740, this area was laid out ""in a similar fashion to the earlier subdivision on the b [p]lan.""  thus, access ways ran to cape cod bay from the road that paralleled the water (again, with the ways spaced every few lots).  however, unlike the eastern portion, there was not a separately reserved upland beach lot to which the access ways led.nor did the deeds or certificates of title to the shoreland lots in the western portion describe the northern boundary of those lots as ""by the beach.""  instead, each shoreland lot was described as being bounded ""by the waters of cape cod bay"" (or similar language).after the shoreland area of the western portion was subdivided, the inland lots in that area were developed.  although most of the deeds or certificates of title for the lots held by the inland owners reference rights in hickey way or the other reserved ways, none of them references any reserved beach rights.  as discussed further below, there are two owners of inland lots who are not parties to this case whose deeds do reference beach rights.discussion.as the court did in hickey i, we begin by examining whether the shoreland owners hold title to the disputed flats, and then proceed to examine what easement rights, if any, the inland owners were granted in that land.1.  ownership of the disputed flats.  ""the colonial ordinance ofpage 6481641-1647 established that a person holding land adjacent to the sea shall hold title to the land out to the low water mark or 100 rods (1,650 feet), whichever is less.""  pazolt v. director of div. of marine fisheries,, 570 (1994), citing boston waterfront dev. corp. v. commonwealth,, 635 (1979).  although title to the upland portion of shoreland property can be severed from the title to the flats, this generally must be done expressly, that is, through the use of ""excluding words.""  id. at 570-571, quoting from commonwealth v. roxbury,, 524 (1857).  otherwise, the owners of shoreland property are presumed to own the fee in the adjacent flats.  as explained below, we agree with the judge that the inland owners have not overcome the presumption that the disputed flats are owned by the shoreland owners, whose predecessors in title acquired title to them from the original developers.as noted, the shoreland owners' deeds and certificates of title describe their lots as bounded ""by the waters of cape cod bay,"" or equivalent language.  under the cases, such language is interpreted as conveying property to the low water mark.  see michaelson, 342 mass. at 260-261 (""[w]ords in a deed such as 'westerly by wild harbor,' or words of similar import, convey title to the low water mark""); brown v. kalicki,, 535, 538 (2016) (language that land was bounded by ""nantucket sound"" gave title to low water mark, including with respect to any accretions).  in addition, most of these deeds or certificates of title note that the property is being held subject to the public rights reserved by the colonial ordinance.  such references would make no sense if the land being conveyed were bounded by the mean high tide mark, with the fee to the intertidal area reserved to others.  thus, far from providing evidence helpful to the inland owners, the deeds and certificates of title to the shoreland lots support the shoreland owners' claim that they own title down to the mean low water mark.in trying to argue that that the fee in the disputed flats nevertheless was reserved by the original developers, the inland owners seek support in the rulings that the supreme judicial court made in hickey i with respect to the fee in hickey way.  this analogy does not aid them.  in hickey i, the court relied, in great part, on the fact that the deed and certificates of title to the relevant shoreland lots referenced hickey way as the side boundary to those lots and also gave the shoreland owners themselves the right to use hickey way for access (something that would havepage 649been unnecessary if the original developers had intended to convey title to hickey way).  hickey i, 472 mass. at 748.  in the case before us, the inland owners cannot raise any similar textual arguments based on the language in the deeds or certificates of title to the shoreland lots.similarly, any comparisons to the development of the eastern portion of the tobey tract also do not aid the inland owners' case.  while there are some broad similarities as to how the two portions of the tobey tract were developed, there are also some important distinctions.  most significantly, as noted, there was an upland beach in the eastern portion that the original developers carved out as a separate lot, with the lots immediately to the south of the beach lot denoted as being bounded by that beach.  with respect to the western portion, the inland owners cannot point to any evidence in the deeds or certificates of title to the lots owned by the litigants -- or in the plans that document the progression of the development of the western portion -- that evince that the original developers intended to carve out a beach lot comparable to the one on the eastern side.see labounty v. vickers,, 349 (1967) (""a person examining [the relevant] plan could reasonably discern that [an access] easement [to the water] had been reserved[,] . . . [b]ut there is nothing on the plan to show that the beach area [on either side] of the strip was similarly reserved"").  comparisons to the development of the eastern portion of the tobey tract therefore hurt, rather than help, the inland owners' case.the only robust evidence that the inland owners have identified in support of their claim that the original developers might have intended to retain the fee in the disputed flats for use as a communal beach comes from the deeds to two inland lots (lots h-a2 and h-a3), whose owners are not parties to this litigation.  specifically, the deeds to those two lots -- which were the first granted by the original developers for inland lots in the western portion of the tobey tract -- purported to convey the right to usepage 650a beach owned by the developers, referenced in one of the deeds as ""the beach reserved by the grantors for use of the lot owners in this development.""  however, which beach was being referenced in those deeds is not at all clear.  given the lack of any other indication that the original developers at that point still owned a separate beach lot carved out on the western portion of the tobey tract, the judge concluded that the unidentified beach referenced in the two deeds was likely beach lot b-e (the long, private demarcated upland beach created on the eastern portion of the tract).in any event, whatever beach rights were conveyed to the owners of lots h-a2 and h-a3 (an issue not resolved by the current litigation), we agree with the judge that the two deeds in question are not enough to overcome the presumption that the shoreland owners acquired the fee in the disputed flats.  we turn next to the inland owners' claim that they nevertheless hold an easement to use the disputed flats for general beach purposes.2.  alleged easements in the disputed flats.  it is undisputed that the certificates of title to the shoreland lots (which include the disputed flats) make no reference to beach rights held by others (other than to those public rights reserved by the colonial ordinance).  that fact alone presumptively negates the inland owners' claim that they own such rights.  see hickey i, 472 mass. at 754 (""[f]or registered land to be burdened by an easement, generally the easement must be shown on the certificate of title"").  however, ""there are two exceptions to th[is] general rule.""  id. at 755, citing jackson v. knott,, 711 (1994).  the inland owners argue that the first exception recognized by jackson applies.under the first jackson exception, even where the certificate of title does not show an easement, courts nevertheless can find registered land impressed with an easement if a review of the certificate revealed facts ""which would prompt a reasonable purchaser to investigate further other certificates of title, documents, or plans in the registration system"" that memorialized such an easement.  hickey i, at 755-756, citing jackson, 418 mass. at 711.page 651however, even if we assumed arguendo that a reasonable purchaser of the shoreland lots somehow was put on notice that he or she should investigate further whether other documents in the registration system reflected an intent to reserve beach rights easements in the disputed flats, a review of those documents would not actually reflect such an intent.as noted, while many of the deeds or certificates of title to the inland owners' lots reference rights to use hickey way and the other access ways, none references a right to use the disputed flats.  compare anderson v. devries,, 129, 134 (1950), overruled on other grounds by m.p.m. builders, llc v. dwyer,(2004) (inland owners held to have beach rights where certificates of title of both inland and shore properties referenced access easement ""to the beach"" and where ""[t]he chief inducement for the purchase of [the inland parcels] was the right to use the beach for swimming, bathing, and sun bathing""); houghton v. johnson,, 834-835 (2008) (even as to nonregistered land, reservation of recorded right of way ""leading to the beach,"" without more, held insufficient to support implied easement to use privately held beach outside of right of way).once again, the inland owners seek to invoke the deeds to lots h-a2 and h-a3 to support their claim that they have beach rights in the disputed flats even though the certificates of title to the shoreland lots make no reference to such rights.  as already noted, however, it is far from clear that the particular beach referenced in those deeds is the one comprised of the disputed flats.  in any event, as the judge aptly observed, ""[e]ven if the inference could be made that [the h-a2 and h-a3 deeds] referred to the [d]isputed [f]lats, there is nothing in the record indicating that [the inland owners'] lots were intended to be benefitted by these conveyances, which represent outliers among the thousands of deeds to hundreds of lots within the tobey [t]ract.""the inland owners are left to argue that their easements to use hickey way and the other access ways to reach the intertidal area necessarily indicate the original developers' intent that the inland owners be able to use the entire intertidal beach area for generalpage 652beach purposes.  it makes no sense, they argue, for the original developers to have created a system of access ways for the benefit of the inland owners unless such owners thereby acquired significantly greater rights than the public at large.  they maintain that because members of the general public can access a public beach down the road, and additionally have the right to undertake fishing, fowling, and navigation in privately held intertidal areas, then it must follow that the original developers intended the inland owners to be able to spread out onto the entire beach area and use it for all normal beach purposes.we are unpersuaded.  through the easements they hold in hickey way and the other access ways, the inland owners enjoy significant rights not possessed by the general public.  for example, the inland owners can use the access ways closer to their homes and not have to walk down to the public ways to access cape cod bay and the disputed flats.  in addition, as we note infra, there is nothing in the undisputed facts to indicate that the inland owners necessarily would be limited to fishing, fowling, and navigation within those portions of the intertidal area that lie within the corridors of the access ways themselves.  simply put, holding that the inland owners never obtained rights to use the disputed flats for general beach purposes does not render their rights in the access ways so ""worthless"" that we must draw a contrary conclusion.  in sum, we agree with the judge's conclusion that the first jackson exception does not apply, and that there is no other basis for inferring the existence of easements that do not appear on the certificates of title to the shoreland lots.3.  ambiguity in the judgment.  we are not quite done, because it is appropriate that we address a facial ambiguity in the judgment, lest our affirmance of it be misunderstood.before turning to that language, we briefly review the overall scope of the current litigation.the case before us has always been about whether the inland owners could use the disputed flats for general beach purposes, and not just for fishing, fowling, and navigation.  the portions of the intertidal beach that lie within the access ways themselves are not part of the disputed flats, because title to them is not held by the shoreland owners but instead by the unidentified heirs of the original developers (who, like the shoreland owners, presumably hold title down to the low water mark).  see hickey i, 472 mass. atpage 653753.accordingly, the extent of the inland owners' rights to use the access ways was implicated in the current litigation only to the extent that it bore on any rights they claimed in the disputed flats.  the extent of their rights to use the beach area lying within the boundaries of the access ways was not at issue in this case.the judge's well-crafted memorandum of decision is fully consistent with the scope of the litigation.  despite the length of that memorandum, there is nothing therein to suggest that the judge was adjudicating the extent of the inland owners' rights to use the access ways themselves.  with one potential exception, the terms of the judgment he entered are also consistent with this scope.  thus, the judgment recites that it adjudged ""that [the shoreland owners] own the portions of the [d]isputed [f]lats adjacent to their respective properties, and . . . that [the inland owners] have no rights in the [d]isputed [f]lats other than their colonial ordinance rights.""  the potential exception involves a provision in the judgment that ""ordered and adjudged that [the inland owners'] rights in the [referenced access] ways are limited to the use thereof to access the [d]isputed [f]lats solely for the purpose of exercising their colonial ordinance rights"" (footnote omitted).  read literally, this phrasing could be taken as saying that the inland owners have no rights to use the access ways themselves for any purpose other than those reserved by the colonial ordinance (that is, fishing, fowling, and navigation).  we reject this interpretation, which would resolve issues outside the scope of this litigation and would be unsupported by -- and indeed inconsistent with -- the judge's memorandum of decision.instead, we interpret the provision as meaning -- as we believe the judge intended -- that while the access ways providepage 654the inland owners the right to gain access to the disputed flats, they may gain such access only to exercise the rights reserved by the colonial ordinance.  we leave to another day resolution of the scope of the inland owners' rights to use the access ways themselves.judgment

[658-659]","on march 3, 2016, the conservation commission of dennis (commission) issued an approval pursuant to the local wetlands by-law (by-law) for a walkway and stairs (walkway) proposed by pathways association, inc. (pathways).  the walkway is designed to allow certain inland owners to use their easements to access cape cod bay.  brian and mary hickey (the hickeys), who own property that abuts the site of the proposed walkway, brought an action in the nature of certiorari challengingpage 656the commission's approval.  see g. l. c. 249, § 4.  on the hickeys' motion for judgment on the pleadings, a superior court judge ruled that they lacked standing to maintain this action, and judgment entered affirming the commission's decision.  we affirm.background.  this case involves a twenty-foot wide access way (hickey way) that runs from shore drive to cape cod bay in dennis.  hickey way was the subject of earlier litigation.  see hickey v. pathways assn., inc.,(2015) (hickey i).  together with the couple that owned the property on the other side of hickey way, the hickeys brought a land court action seeking to establish that each couple owned to the center line of the way, and that various owners of nearby inland lots had no rights to use it.  id. at 738.  the hickeys named pathways -- the incorporated association representing the inland owners in their quest to use hickey way -- as the lead defendant in that action.  the supreme judicial court eventually ruled in favor of pathways and the inland owners.  id. at 738-739.  the court specifically held that the underlying fee interest in hickey way was not held by the hickeys and their coplaintiffs, but instead had been retained by the original developers of the tract that included all of the respective properties (thereafter devolving to the original developers' heirs).  id. at 743.  the court also held that the inland owners hold easements in hickey way allowing them to use it for access.  ibid.the area through which hickey way runs includes a steep, armored coastal bank that lies parallel to the water.  because of this topography, the inland owners cannot make use of their access rights in hickey way unless some version of the walkway is built there.on the heels of its victory in hickey i, pathways sought to build such a structure over hickey way, and it filed a permit application -- known as a notice of intent -- to do so.  on their own, and through their counsel and wetlands consultant, the hickeys submitted comments in opposition to the proposal.  in particular, the hickeys opposed the width of the proposed walkway and the fact that the proposal included landings (measuring eight by ten feet each), on which people could congregate or store items.  the hickeys were concerned that people congregating in the landing areas would disrupt their enjoyment of their nearbypage 657home.  they were also concerned that people who used the walkway to reach the intertidal beach area at the bottom of the stairs inevitably would stray onto their portion of the beach and use it for general beach purposes.the commission unanimously approved the project by issuing an order of conditions pursuant to both g. l. c. 131, § 40 (the wetlands protection act), and the by-law.  the hickeys filed the current certiorari action challenging the approval issued under the by-law, and they simultaneously filed an administrative appeal with the department of environmental protection (dep) pursuant to the wetlands protection act.  in the latter appeal, the dep issued a superseding order of conditions that approved a somewhat smaller version of the walkway.  unsatisfied with this partial victory, the hickeys filed a further administrative appeal at the dep.  however, before that appeal was heard, the dep stayed the matter until resolution of the hickeys' certiorari action (then pending in the superior court, now before us).after the commission assembled the record that had been before it, the hickeys filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, to which pathways filed an opposition.  without addressing the underlying merits, the judge ruled that the hickeys lacked standing to maintain this action.discussion.  to demonstrate standing to bring a certiorari action to challenge the wetlands approval issued by the commission, the hickeys must ""make[] a requisite showing of a reasonable likelihood that [they have] suffered injury to a protected legal right.""  higby/fulton vineyard, llc v. board of health of tisbury,, 850 (2007).  unlike in the zoning context, the hickeys do not enjoy presumptive standing based on their status as abutters.  ibid.when their standing was challenged, the hickeys did not submit affidavits seeking to establish how they would be adverselypage 658affected by the proposed walkway.instead, they relied on the comments that they, their attorney, and their wetlands consultant had submitted to the commission as part of the administrative process.  as the judge accurately pointed out, ""the heart of the [hickeys'] opposition to the proposed [walkway] is their fear that it will increase recreational activity within the private way, potentially spilling over onto the [hickeys'] private property, which the [hickeys] find offensive or injurious.""  these concerns do not fall within the wetlands-related interests protected by the by-law, and therefore cannot form the basis of standing to challenge a decision made under it.  see enos v. secretary of envtl. affairs,, 135 (2000), quoting from massachusetts assn. of indep. ins. agents & brokers, inc. v. commissioner of ins.,, 293 (1977) (to establish standing to challenge governmental action, alleged injury must fall ""within the area of concern of the statute or regulatory scheme"").to the extent that the hickeys' comments addressed wetlands issues at all, they essentially argued that pathways had not met its burden of proof with regard to such issues, rather than trying to demonstrate affirmatively what specific harms the walkway would cause.  we agree with the judge that the hickeys' factual assertions about such harm were raised ""in a conclusory fashion, and [were unsupported by] expert evidence, technical analysis, or particular facts in the record that establish [the purported risks].""on this record, we conclude that the hickeys have not ""put forward evidence to show actual, substantial injury"" to the interests protected by the by-law, and their claims are of a ""speculative nature"" insufficient to support standing.  higby/fulton vineyard, llc, 70 mass. app. ct. at 851-852.the hickeys additionally argue that they have automatic standing based on the uncontested fact they too hold an accesspage 659easement in hickey way.specifically, the hickeys argue that because pathways's ""standing"" to seek approval to build the walkway rests on its representing those who own an access easement in hickey way,it necessarily must follow that their own interest in the way provides them standing to challenge the commission's approval of pathways's proposal.  any superficial appeal of such an ""equivalency"" argument vanishes under scrutiny.as the incorporated association representing inland owners who hold easements allowing them to use hickey way for access, pathways is a proper party to seek approval to build a walkway in order that such access rights can be used.  see hickey i, 472 mass. at 741 (observing that land court judgment that in pertinent part was being affirmed ""explicitly permitted [the inland owners] whom [the judge] concluded had access rights over [hickey way] to repair or rebuild the [walkway structure that had been there] and to make use of [hickey way]"").  the hickeys' own access easement in hickey way may provide them a basis for arguing -- in a proper forum -- that the inland owners' use of hickey way will overburden or otherwise interfere with their own right to use hickey way.  see id. at 753 (recognizing that hickeys, ""as easement holders, have an interest in preventing use of the way by those without rights of access"").it does not, however, provide the hickeys a basis for arguing that the commission's approval of the project pursuant to the by-law will cause them harm of the type that the by-law was intended to protect.  cf. picard v. zoning bd. of appeals of westminster,, 574-575 (2016) (plaintiff who held easement in site of proposed development lacked standing to bring zoning challenge).in sum, we agree with the judge that the hickeys failed to demonstrate their standing to bring this action in the nature of certiorari, and we therefore affirm the judgment.so ordered.",civil,Alexander H.

[664]in a medical malpractice action, the superior court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion of the defendant medical practice to amend the pleadings to add the so-called charitable cap (i.e., the statutory limitation on tort liability afforded to certain charitable organizations pursuant to g. l. c. 231, § 85k) as an affirmative defense under mass.r.civ.p. 15(a), where the defendant's delay (i.e., four years of litigation and two weeks of trial) caused manifest prejudice to the plaintiffs [664-665]; further, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant's motion to amend under mass.r.civ.p. 15(b), where the plaintiffs' actions revealed that they did not consent, but rather expressly declined to consent to try the issue of the defendant's charitable status, and where the documents that the defendant sought to introduce to prove its charitable status were marked for identification and were not intended for the jury. [665-666]in a medical malpractice action, the superior court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion of the defendant medical practice for a new trial, where no prejudice arose from the testimony of the plaintiffs' expert witness, in that the defendant's own pretrial expert disclosures demonstrated that the defendant was on notice as to the plaintiffs' theory of causation, i.e., the defendant was prepared to and did rebut the expert's testimony at trial. [666-668]in a medical malpractice action, the superior court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial on the basis of the plaintiffs' payment of a contingency fee to a consulting service used topage 662locate medical experts (but not to the medical experts, who were themselves paid flat fees pro rata based on their time spent preparing for and providing testimony), where no case or rule in massachusetts prohibited the practice and the defendant pointed to nothing in the record to suggest that the payment had any effect on the independence of the expert witnesses who testified for the plaintiffs. [668-669]in a medical malpractice action, the superior court judge neither erred nor abused his discretion in reducing only so much of the jury's award as was for past medical bills, where the jury reasonably could have calculated, based on the evidence at trial, without any reference to a misrepresentation by the plaintiffs' counsel in closing argument, that the plaintiffs were entitled to $11 million for future medical expenses. [669-672]","following a trial, a jury returned a verdict for timothy larkin, who brought this medical malpractice suit individually and on behalf of his wife, andrea larkin,and his daughter, alexa larkin (collectively, plaintiffs, or larkin).  the jury awarded damages in the sum of $35.4 million, which a judge of the superior court later reduced to approximately $32.5 million on the motion of the defendant, dedham medical associates (dma).  on appeal, dma claims the judge made erroneous rulings on its posttrial motions.  we affirm.background.  the unfortunate facts of this case are not disputed in this appeal.  andrea, a former elementary school teacher, exercise class instructor, and marathon runner, complained of persistent dizziness beginning in 2004.  she underwent a magnetic resonance imaging procedure at massachusetts general hospital (mgh), which revealed a venous varixin her brain that was determined not to be a cause of her dizziness symptoms.  herpage 663primary care doctor, jehane johnston, an employee of dma, was copied on the mgh report, but failed to note the venous varix on andrea's ""problem list,"" which is designed to alert a patient's various treating physicians to her medical conditions.  as a result, when andrea became pregnant in 2007, her obstetricians were not informed about her venous abnormality.  andrea was not informed that this condition posed a particular risk of the venous varix rupturing during vaginal labor using the valsalva maneuver or that an elective caesarian section would avoid placing additional stress on the veins in her head and neck.andrea delivered her daughter vaginally using the valsalva maneuver in june of 2008.twelve hours after andrea delivered her baby, she experienced a sudden, very painful headache, which accompanied a rupture of the venous varix in her brain.  after having emergency surgery to remove a part of her skull and falling into a month-long coma, andrea awoke to find that her legs and left hand were paralyzed, her trunk muscles were impaired, and that she had difficulty chewing, swallowing, and speaking.  despite having physical therapy twice per week, the occasional occupational, water, and speech therapies, and a ""battery"" of daily medications, andrea's injuries are permanent.  she requires care around the clock and likely will for the duration of her lifetime.larkin filed this suit against dma and dr. johnston.  a two-week long trial commenced on april 27, 2015.  the jury rendered a verdict in favor of larkin and awarded $35.4 million.dma filed a series of posttrial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, for a new trial and/or remittitur, to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence, and to alter or amend the judgment, challenging the verdict and the jury award, alleging, among other things, (1) that it was entitled to the benefit of the statutory limitation on tort liability afforded to certain charitable organizations pursuant to g. l. c. 231, § 85k, as then in effect, (2) that testimony provided by larkin's expert improperly exceeded the bounds of the parties' joint pretrial memorandum, (3) that larkin entered into an impermissible contingent fee arrangementpage 664for consulting services, and (4) that larkin's counsel misrepresented the amount of andrea's past medical bills, causing an ""anchoring"" effect that inflated the jury award.  the judge denied the majority of these motions, but reduced the jury's award in part to adjust for an error in the calculation of andrea's past medical bills.discussion.  1.  general laws c. 231, § 85k.  dma first argues that the judge erred in denying its motion to amend the pleadings to conform to evidence of its charitable status pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 15(a) and (b),  365 mass. 761  (1974).  it also alleges error in the judge's denial of its motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 59(e),  365 mass. 827  (1974), to conform to the statutory cap on liability as provided in g. l. c. 231, § 85k, as then in effect, which limited the liability of certain charitable organizations to $20,000.for substantially the same reasons listed in the judge's thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum and order denying dma's motions, we disagree.a.  statutory limitation on liability.  the statutory limit set forth in § 85k is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded and proved by the entity seeking to utilize it.  see keene v. brigham & women's hosp., inc.,, 238-239 (2003).  ""although technically a limitation on liability, the charitable cap set forth in § 85k has been treated as an affirmative defense that must be pleaded under mass.r.civ.p. 8 (c),  365 mass. 749  (1974) (listing specific affirmative defenses, and concluding with the residuary clause 'any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense').""  ibid., citing harlow v. chin,, 715 (1989).  it is undisputed that dma did not plead the statutory cap as an affirmative defense in its answer.  therefore, as is the case with other affirmative defenses, see anthony's pier four, inc. v. hbc assocs.,, 471 (1991), dma waived the statutory limitation on liability.b.  motion to amend.  rule 15(a) of the massachusetts rules of civil procedure permits a party to amend the pleadings ""by leavepage 665of court"" ""when justice so requires.""  rule 15(b) allows a party to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence ""[w]hen issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties[.]""  a judge enjoys considerable discretion in deciding whether to allow or deny a motion to amend a complaint.  murphy v. i.s.k.con. of new england, inc.,, 864 (1991).  here, the judge denied dma's motion on both rule 15(a) and (b) grounds.with regard to rule 15(a), as the judge stated in his memorandum and order, dma ""moved to amend its answer to add the charitable cap as an affirmative defense after more than four years of litigation and two weeks of trial.""  dma did not suggest that ""this defense was unavailable to it when the answer was filed in 2011, and, aside from inadvertence, [gave no] reason for the delay.""  such a prolonged delay, the judge found, caused ""manifest"" prejudice to the plaintiffs and made amendment pursuant to rule 15(a) inappropriate.  we agree.  see divenuti v. reardon,, 77 (1994) (""among the good reasons . . . for which a motion to amend may be denied are that no justification for the lateness of the motion is apparent [beyond counsel for the moving party having had a late dawning idea] and that one or more of the nonmoving parties would be caught off balance by the proffered amendment"").there was no abuse of discretion.with regard to dma's rule 15(b) motion to amend the pleadings to conform to the evidence, the judge found that the parties did not try the issue of dma's charitable status by either express or implied consent.  although dma points to its pretrial efforts to have larkin stipulate to its charitable status, larkin refused to do so.  furthermore, larkin objected when, on the last day of trial, dma sought to introduce its state certificate to prove its charitable status, which was marked for identification to be kept apart from the jury.  the plaintiffs objected and reserved their right to argue about dma's status.  the plaintiffs' actions reveal that they did not consent, but rather, that they expressly declined to consent to try the issue of dma's status.  absent such consent, the judge acted within his discretion to deny dma's 15(b) motion.additionally, dma claims that the introduction of its state certificate constituted prima facie evidence of its charitable statuspage 666such that the judge erred in denying its motion.  we disagree.  the documents dma sought to introduce were marked for identification and were not intended for the jury.  ""absent circumstances or an agreement revealing a different approach, . . . 'documents marked for identification are not evidence.'""  lingis v. waisbren,, 470 (2009), quoting from commonwealth v. o'neil,, 177 n.7 (2001).  here, the judge did not indicate that he intended to take a different approach, as was taken in goldberg v. northeastern univ.,, 711-713 (2004), in which the judge explicitly bifurcated the trial to resolve, separately from the jury, whether the statutory cap applied and, in doing so, marked the university's certificate of incorporation and articles of organization for identification.  instead, here, the judge reassured the plaintiffs that they had reserved their rights as to dma's (unpleaded) limitation on liability, and indicated that ""[i]f it comes to an issue, ultimately that's for post-trial jousting.""  it was within the judge's discretion to determine that the issue did not arise during the course of the proceedings, making any posttrial ""jousting"" unnecessary, and to deny dma's motion.2.  larkin's expert witness.  dma next claims that a new trial is warranted because larkin's expert, dr. chavali, testified beyond the anticipated testimony contained within the joint pretrial memorandum.  we disagree.our rules of civil procedure direct parties to disclose the identity of expert witnesses they plan to call and the ""subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.""  mass.r.civ.p. 26(b)(4)(a)(i),  365 mass. 772  (1974).  such disclosures provide notice to the other parties about the intended use of a party's experts, who are considered key factual witnesses in medical malpractice cases.  see kace v. liang,, 636-640 (2015).  it is within a judge's broad discretion to admit or exclude properly disclosed expert testimony, and, absent prejudicial error, we will not disturb a judge's exercise of that discretion.  id. at 637.page 667the parties' joint pretrial memorandum indicates that dr. chavali was expected to testify that ""the size of a venous varix can change substantially and that the rupture rate increases substantially during pregnancy.""  the parties also anticipated dr. chavali would testify that ""had a cesarean section and/or other alternative treatment . . . been performed or offered to ms. larkin that to a reasonable degree of medical certainty she would not have suffered an intracranial bleed and the ensuing catastrophic brain injuries.""  in his trial testimony, dr. chavali described his basis for stating that pushing using the valsalva maneuver was a cause of andrea's injuries:  increased intracranial pressure while pushing prevents blood from exiting, leading to a rupture of the venous varix.  later, he stated that the ""venous aneurysm itself may not have ruptured, but [it] was the back-pressure within it from occlusion that caused this rupture.  and that rupture is this hemorrhage that's in the brain.""dma contends that dr. chavali testified about causation theories that went beyond the barebones pretrial disclosure.  although the pretrial memorandum did not entail the full range of explanation to which dr. chavali testified, what was disclosed was consistent with and not qualitatively different from his trial testimony.  in other words, the disclosure was sufficient to provide dma with notice that the plaintiffs would proffer testimony from dr. chavali regarding the nature and causes of the risk of undertaking the valsalva maneuver in light of the venous varix in andrea's brain.  dr. chavali's testimony then provided the jury with a detailed explanation of how such a risk unfolded in this case, namely, the manner in which increased pressure from the valsalva maneuver built up and caused the venous varix in andrea's brain to rupture.furthermore, the pretrial memorandum, dated june 2, 2014, supplied dma with information regarding dr. chavali's intended testimony at trial almost one year prior to its commencement, ample time during which dma could have further explored the matter.no prejudice resulted, since the pretrial memorandum satisfied the goal of the disclosure rule:  ""to facilitate the fair exchange of information about critical witnesses and to prevent unfairpage 668surprise.""  kace v. liang, 472 mass. at 636-637.indeed, dma's own pretrial expert disclosures demonstrate that dma was on notice as to larkin's theory of causation.  dma knew of dr. chavali's anticipated testimony and specifically retained multiple experts, including rebuttal testimony that the process of labor did not cause andrea's hemorrhage.  thus, dma understood larkin's causation theory from the disclosure, and the trial judge, who had broad discretion to decide the matter, understood as well.  dma was prepared to and did rebut dr. chavali's testimony at trial.3.  contingency fee arrangement.  dma also claims that it is entitled to a new trial because the judge improperly denied its motion for posttrial discovery regarding the plaintiffs' expert witness compensation.  it alleges that the plaintiffs paid a contingency fee to new england medical legal consultants, inc. (nemlc), and that such an arrangement undermines the integrity of the judicial process.  we disagree.while payment of a contingency fee to an expert witness is prohibited in massachusetts,see new england tel. & tel. co. v. board of assessors of boston,, 871-872 (1984), no massachusetts authority has held the same is true of payments made to compensate a consulting service, such as the one retained by the plaintiffs here.  although not binding on us, dma relies on cases from outside our jurisdiction holding that similar contracts are void as contrary to the established public policy of those states.  see, e.g., first natl. bank of springfield v. malpractice research, inc., 179 ill. 2d 353 (1997).  in contrast, however, such contracts have been upheld in other jurisdictions.  see, e.g., schackow v. medical-legal consulting serv., inc., 46 md. app. 179, 197 (1980) (""all the experts were to be paid a flat fee by the client.  [the consultant]'s role was limited to locating potential experts and then educating them about the case . . . .  thatpage 669arrangement does not violate the public policy of maryland"").  no consistent treatment of consulting contracts emerges from a survey of these extrajurisdictional cases.the rule that expert witnesses may not collect contingent fees relates to a concern that contingent fees will improperly induce expert witnesses to provide outcome-oriented testimony.  see rule 3.4 of the aba model rules of professional conduct (1983) (""a lawyer shall not . . . [b] . . . offer an inducement to a witness that is prohibited by law""), and comment [3] (""the common law rule in most jurisdictions is that . . . it is improper to pay an expert witness a contingent fee"").  see also mass.r.prof.c. 3.4(b), (g) & comments 3, 5,  426 mass. 1389  (1998) (adopting american bar association model rule).  those same concerns are not directly implicated by the payment of contingency fees to consulting services to locate medical experts, where the medical experts are themselves paid flat fees pro rata based on their time spent preparing for and providing testimony.  where no case or rule (in this jurisdiction) prohibits the practice, we will not upset the judgment on the basis of how these consultants were paid.  moreover, dma points to nothing in the record that suggests the payment made to nemlc had any effect on the independence of the expert witnesses who testified for the plaintiffs.  accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the judge's denial of dma's motion for new trial and/or remittitur.4.  past medical expenses.  finally, dma claims error in the judge's reduction of the jury award.  although the judge reduced the award for past medical bills upon dma's motion, dma now argues that the plaintiffs' misrepresentation of andrea's past medical bills had an ""anchoring"" effect -- especially in light of a lack of evidence to support the $11 million award for future medical expenses -- that influenced the entire jury award, which the judge should have vacated.  we disagree.""questions concerning inadequate or excessive damages are initially within the discretion of the trial judge.""  pridgen v. boston hous. authy.,, 715 (1974), citing bartley v. phillips,, 41-44 (1944).  ""[a]n award of damages must stand unless . . . to permit it to stand was an abuse of discretion on the part of the court below, amounting to an error of law.""  reckis v. johnson & johnson,, 299 (2015), quoting from labonte v. hutchins & wheeler,, 824 (1997).  an error of law occurs ""if 'the damages awarded were greatly disproportionate to the injury proven or representedpage 670a miscarriage of justice.'""  reckis v. johnson & johnson, supra, quoting from labonte v. hutchins & wheeler, supra.  furthermore, damages are considered excessive ""when they are 'so great . . . that it may be reasonably presumed that the jury, in assessing them, did not exercise a sound discretion, but were influenced by passion, partiality, prejudice or corruption.'""  reckis v. johnson & johnson, supra, quoting from bartley v. phillips, supra at 41.here, the misrepresentation, the occurrence of which is not in dispute, arose as follows.  larkin's counsel, in his closing argument, stated that, considering the $4,000 per week andrea paid for her care, a potential award of $8 million would not ""include her four million dollars in medical bills.""  dma did not object to this statement at the time it was made.  the judge instructed the jury that attorneys' closing arguments do not constitute evidence.  after entering their deliberations, the jury returned with a question that indicated the jury may have been influenced by the misrepresentation:  ""out of the four million dollars of medical bills, how much was paid out of pocket by the larkin family?""  in answering the jury's question, the judge instructed the jury that larkin is ""entitled to be . . . compensated for those expenses which were reasonable in amount and which were reasonably necessary.""  to make that determination, the judge explained that ""[i]temized medical hospital bills were admitted as evidence of the fair and reasonable charges for such services.""  again, neither party corrected the misrepresentation and dma did not object to it.the judge determined there was no dispute that, in light of the evidence introduced, andrea's past medical bills amounted to $1,272,013.70, rather than $4 million, the amount referenced in larkin's closing argument.the award for past medical bills, as the judge found, ""likely resulted from mistaken representations to the jury by the plaintiffs at trial and, in any event, . . . lacked a sufficient evidentiary foundation to avoid reduction.""  accordingly, the judge reduced the award for past medical expenses to the baseline amount reflected in the record.dma does not allege that this reduction was an abuse of discretion.page 671dma claims that, because the plaintiffs introduced limited evidence as to future medical expenses, the jury may have relied on the misrepresentation to reach its $11 million award for anticipated future medical costs.  in arguing a lack of evidence related to future medical costs, dma cites to (1) dr. chavali's statement that andrea's injuries were permanent; (2) andrea's father's testimony that her medical costs at the time ""roughly"" totaled $4,000 per week; and (3) evidence that andrea's life expectancy was another forty-seven years from the time of trial.  dma claims that this was insufficient evidence on which to base an award for future damages, and, therefore, that the misrepresentation ""anchored"" the jury, leading to an improper award.  we disagree.although the plaintiffs did not introduce expert witnesses to prove future medical expenses, dma points to no case holding that such evidence is required, and it raises no independent argument that the damages award should be vacated on this basis.  cf. simon v. solomon,, 105 (1982).  based on the testimony that andrea's medical care costs ""roughly $4,000 a week"" and that her injury is permanent -- testimony that the jury were free to credit -- and that her life expectancy is another forty-seven years, the jury could have reasonably calculated that the plaintiffs were entitled to $11 million for future medical expenses.  this figure could represent an estimated weekly cost of $4,500,totaling $234,000 per year, spread over forty-seven years.the jury's reasonable calculation, grounded in the evidence at trial, could have been made without any reference to larkin's misrepresentation.  it is not disproportionate to andrea's injuries, as it is based in andrea's current costs, which are likely to continue in the future.  nor does it indicate the jury were ""influenced by passion, partiality, prejudice or corruption.""  reckis v. johnson & johnson, 471 mass. at 299, quoting from bartley v. phillips, 317 mass. at 41.  therefore, the judge neither erred nor abused his discretion in reducing only the award for pastpage 672medical bills.  see ramos v. storlazzi,, 877-878 (1980) (finding no abuse of discretion where judge denied motion for new trial based on misrepresentations that were admitted into evidence without objection).judgment affirmed.orders denying postjudgment

affirm.background.  we summarize the evidence in the summary judgment record in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the nonmoving party.  see augat, inc. v. liberty mut. ins. co.,, 120 (1991).1.  legal malpractice claim.  in september, 2008, perreault retained mann to represent him in a wrongful death action.  perreault wanted mann to advise him regarding an action against tobacco companies for the death of his wife due to cancer.  perreault's wife died in march, 2006.  the statute of limitations on a wrongful death action is three years.  see g. l. c. 229, § 2.in may, 2009, mann obtained a medical opinion regarding the likelihood of success of an action by perreault.  mann retained a registered nurse, who opined that the case had merit but questioned whether the statute of limitations had run.  mann withheld this report from perreault and in july, 2009, sent a letter to perreault stating that there was no likelihood of success on the wrongful death claim and terminating his representation.  perreault sought the opinion of another attorney, who requested mann's file and determined that there was a viable claim of attorney malpractice.  thereafter, perreault sent mann a g. l. c. 93a demand letter and filed suit against mann.2.  legal malpractice insurance policies.  there are three relevant insurance policies, covering three firms with which mann was involved during the relevant time period.  all of these policies were ""claims made and reported"" policies.  the parties agree thatpage 675coverage was available only when both the alleged misconduct and resulting claim arose during a policy period. that is, if the alleged malpractice arose before the policy period, coverage would only be available if the malpractice arose on or after a policy's ""prior acts"" date, or fell within an ""automatic extended reporting period"" of sixty days after the policy terminated.a.  a&g policy.  in 2006, mann was an associate at the law firm of arnowitz & goldberg (a&g).  the law firm consisted of mann, jerrold arnowitz, and henry goldberg.  mann had no involvement in acquiring or purchasing the a&g professional liability policy with liberty through aon.  he did not review the a&g policy, did not discuss the policy with arnowitz or goldberg, and had limited communication with aon regarding the a&g policy.b.  agm policy.  in 2007, arnowitz, goldberg, & mann llc (agm) was formed.  mann, now one of three managing members of agm, contacted kathleen burns at aon in august, 2007, to obtain insurance coverage for agm.  burns sent mann an application and helped him fill out pertinent information to complete the application.  although mann claims that he ""relied exclusively on [burns's] advice and recommendation as to different types of policies,"" burns did not evaluate agm's particular coverage needs and was not asked to provide risk management services or consultation regarding the scope of insurance that agm might need.  aon placed agm's malpractice insurance policy with liberty.c.  mann firm policy.  in late december, 2009, mann left agm.  mann opened the law offices of simon mann (mann firm) and contacted burns to obtain a new malpractice policy for the mann firm.  mann relied on burns regarding insurance coverage for the mann firm.  mann instructed burns to purchase a new policy for the mann firm with a starting date of january 4, 2010.  mann did not disclose the perreault claim on the application, but he told burns that he ""needed coverage for all my past work since i first became an attorney in

extended reporting period endorsement.""  that same day mann responded on agm letterhead, ""please cancel the insurance policy for [agm] effective no later than december 31, 2009.""mann did not purchase extended reporting coverage for the mann firm.  immediately thereafter, burns responded, ""we received the request and will cancel the [agm] policy 12/31.""the mann firm account was then transferred to matthew kiernan of aon, who handled new accounts.  kiernan communicated with mann about the mann firm policy application.  on january 4, 2010, kiernan sent a completed application to mann for review and approval.  mann executed the application, manually checked a box indicating that it was for a policy with a january 4, 2010, prior acts date, and returned the executed application to aon on january 5.  on february 2, 2010, the mann firm policy issued with coverage for the period of january 4, 2010, to january 4, 2011.  the policy had a prior acts date of january 4, 2010, and no tail.  after receiving the policy, mann did not review it.d.  commencement of the malpractice action.  in march, 2010, perreault sent a g. l. c. 93a demand letter to mann.  mann soughtpage 677coverage for the malpractice action from liberty.  liberty declined coverage under two of the three policies at issue:  the agm policy because it was cancelled, pursuant to mann's request, on december 31, 2009;and the mann firm policy because it was not in effect until january 4, 2010, and did not have prior acts coverage before that date, or a tail.  liberty agreed to provide a defense under the a&g policy.  mann hired new counsel and reached a settlement with perreault, assigning his rights to any claims against liberty and aon to perreault.this litigation ensued.discussion.  on appeal, ""[w]e

that is adequate for the needs of the insured.""  martinonis v. utica natl. ins. group,, 420 (2006).  see robinson v. charles a. flynn ins. agency, inc.,, 902-903 (1995).  however, an insurance agent may acquire a greater duty of investigation, advice, and assistance to an insured by reason of ""special circumstances.""  mccue v. prudential ins. co. of america,, 661-662 (1976).  martinonis, supra at 421.  such ""special circumstances of assertion, representation and reliance"" may create a duty of due care.  mccue, supra at 661, quoting from rapp v. lester l. burdick, inc.,, 442 (1957).factors creating special circumstances include (1) a prolonged business relationship; (2) the complexity and comprehensiveness of the customer's coverages; (3) the frequency of contact between a customer and agent to attend to the customer's insurance needs;page 678and (4) the extent to which a customer relies on the advice of the agent by reason of the complexity of the policies.  see mccue, 371 mass. at 661-663; bicknell, inc. v. havlin,, 500-501 (1980); construction planners, inc. v. dobax ins. agency, inc.,, 674-676 (1991).  the list is not exhaustive; for example, enhanced duties will arise ""when the agent holds himself out as an insurance specialist, consultant or counselor and is receiving compensation for consultation and advice apart from premiums paid by the insured.""  baldwin crane & equip. corp. v. riley & rielly ins. agency, inc.,, 32 (1997) (quotation omitted).viewing the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, no rational finder of fact could conclude that special circumstances existed such that aon owed mann a duty of care.  although burns had worked with a&g since 2005, mann did not have a prolonged business relationship with aon and had no involvement in acquiring or purchasing the a&g professional liability policy.  mann did not communicate personally with aon until 2007, when he sought professional liability coverage for agm, and then again in 2009, to place the mann firm coverage.  his relationship with aon spanned only three years.  contrast mccue, 371 mass. at 660, 662 (twenty-eight-year relationship between insured and agent involving seven different policies).mann's insurance needs were not complex but, rather, were limited to basic malpractice liability insurance coverage.  burns communicated perfunctorily with mann via e-mail, telephone, and letter.  burns did not evaluate agm's particular coverage needs and was not asked to provide risk management services or consultation regarding the scope of insurance that agm or the mann firm might need.  contrast mccue, 371 mass. at 662 (agent made monthly visits to attend to client's insurance needs); martinonis, 65 mass. app. ct. at 421-422 (plaintiffs asked specific questions about adequacy of policy limits and were assured by agent that policy limits were proper).  neither agm nor mann paid any additional fees for professional advice.  see baldwin crane & equip. corp., 44 mass. app. ct. at 32.perreault looks to statements from aon's web site to support the existence of a special relationship.  as the motion judge stated, ""[s]uch reliance is misplaced because [perreault] has not even alleged that mann relied on, or ever even read, these statements prior to this lawsuit.""  furthermore, the affidavit of joseph guerrero, president of aon's ""attorneys' advantage"" and ""a&epage 679advantage"" divisions, states that the web site perreault references pertained to a division of aon with which mann did not deal and listed services that the division mann dealt with did not provide to attorneys who purchased the malpractice liability policies.  neither agm nor the mann firm retained the other aon division to provide additional services.perreault also contends that burns was bound to issue mann a policy with adequate prior acts coverage because mann informed burns that he ""needed coverage for all [his] past work since [he] first became an attorney in 2006,"" and burns responded, ""pleasepage 680make [the agm policy] payment so that [it] does not cancel so we can offer you prior acts.""  this exchange did not create a special relationship.  burns told mann that he needed to keep the agm policy in force if he (or other members of the firm) wanted to be offered prior acts coverage in the future.  see note 3, supra.  she did not promise to provide prior acts coverage, advise him regarding eligibility, or advise him regarding his insurance needs.mann then departed from the path laid out in burns's email and directed that the agm policy lapse no later than december 31, 2009.  he then manually checked a box on the mann firm policy application setting the prior acts coverage date of january 4, 2010.  he did not request a tail, despite the fact that burns told him to read the pertinent clause regarding coverage extensions.  when mann received the mann firm policy it specifically stated that it had a prior acts date of january 4, 2010.  in the absence of a special relationship, mann was obligated to review the mann firm policy before signing.  ""[i]n such circumstances, a business entity such as [mann] should read its policies rather than rely on representations by an agent.""  see sarnafil, inc. v. peerless ins. co.,, 307 (1994).summary judgment was properly granted on the negligence claim as a matter of law because perreault did not demonstrate that there were facts in dispute that would establish a duty running from aon to mann.2.  contract claim.  perreault contends that even if there was no special relationship, aon's failure to secure prior acts coverage was in breach of contract.  the record is devoid of evidence that would permit a fact finder to conclude that there was a contract that obligated aon to ensure mann had particular coverage.  once again, perreault relies on the e-mail exchange where mann stated that he ""needed coverage for all [his] past work since [he] first became an attorney in 2006,"" and burns's response, ""please make [the agm policy] payment so that [it] does not cancel so we can offer you prior acts.""  this exchange did not set forth the material terms of an agreement.  see rodriguez v. massachusetts bay transp. authy.,, 29-30 (2017) (contract must state terms with specificity).  rather, burns told mann to keep the old policy in place so that he could ask for prior acts coverage in the future.  mann sent in a payment for the agm policy, but he soon thereafter shifted course and terminated the agm coverage no later than december 31, 2009.  mann did not request either a prior acts date going back to 2006 or a tail, despite having the extended reporting period endorsement called to his attention.no contract was made.3.  chapter 93a.  in the absence of a special relationship, there is no merit to mann's c. 93a claim.  viewed in the light most favorable to mann, neither burns's handling of mann's request for insurance nor the modification of the a&g policy to exclude him constituted an unfair or deceptive act under g. l. c. 93a.  see generally auto flat car crushers, inc. v. hanover ins. co.,, 820 (2014).  cf. construction planners, inc., 31 mass. app. ct. at 677-678.  summary judgment was properly granted as a matter of law.judgment affirmed.",civil,Karen F.

[686-687]at the trial of an indictment charging possession of a class a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of g. l. c. 94c, § 34, a police detective's expert testimony that the manner in which the 1.49 grams of heroin found on the defendant's person was packaged as fifteen individually wrapped plastic bags inside of a larger plastic bag was consistent with possession with an intent to distribute, as well as evidence that the defendant had no paraphernalia on his person to inject or ingest the heroin, was arrested in a high drug activity area, and was found with half of the cash on his person in his pocket stacked in fifteen and twenty dollar amounts (i.e., consistent with the detective's testimony that each baggie possessed by the defendant had an approximate street value of twenty dollars), was sufficient to sustain his conviction. [687-688]a superior court judge properly denied a criminal defendant's motion for a new trial, where the judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that defensepage 682counsel was not ineffective for failing to submit in evidence documents concerning the defendant's receipt of social security benefits, in that the commonwealth did not refer to the defendant's employment status, the only social security letter in the record did not cover the period when the defendant was arrested, and the defendant failed to establish how such records would have been helpful to his defense or that such records even existed [688-689]; where the judge neither erred nor abused her discretion in finding that, even assuming evidence that the testifying chemist falsely asserted that she had earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry (when in fact she had earned a bachelor's degree in sociology) was newly discovered, it was at best impeachment evidence that did not rise to the level of requiring a new trial [690]; and where the prosecutor's closing argument was properly based on the evidence admitted at trial and the fair inferences drawn therefrom, was not improper in arguing that the evidence showed that the defendant was guilty in spite of the misconduct of another chemist, and, although improper in commenting on that misconduct based on events outside the record of the case, did not prejudice the defendant [690-692].","this is an appeal by the defendant, leonides bones, from his conviction, after a trial by jury, of possession of a class a controlled substance with intent to distribute, see g. l. c. 94c, § 34, and, following a subsequent jury-waived trial conducted in accordance with g. l. c. 278, § 11a, of being a second or subsequent offender.the defendant argues that his motion to suppress was improperly denied because the police were not justified in stopping him on a public sidewalk for drinking an alcoholic beverage as that conduct is not a criminal violation under state or local law.  the defendant further argues that even if the motion to suppress was properly denied, there was insufficient evidence presented at trial to permit the jury to infer that he intended to distribute the heroin found on his person.  finally, the defendantpage 683also appeals the order denying his motion for a new trial arguing that his motion was improperly denied.  for the reasons set forth below, we affirm.the relevant facts are set forth in connection with each of the defendant's several arguments.discussion.  1.  motion to suppress.  the defendant does not take issue with the facts found by the motion judge, which are supported by the evidence.on april 4, 2012, sergeant brian dunn, then a patrolman with the chelsea police department, was in uniform and operating a marked cruiser when he responded to a call from a party reporting possible drug activity.  the caller reported that the offender was a black male wearing a white t-shirt, shorts, and a hat.  on division street, in the vicinity of bellingham square, sergeant dunn observed a black male matching the caller's description.  from prior encounters, sergeant dunn recognized the man as the defendant.  sergeant dunn observed the defendant ""drinking out of a nip type bottle of alcohol"" while he was walking down the sidewalk.  sergeant dunn stopped his cruiser and got out to speak with the defendant.  after seeing sergeant dunn approach, the defendant said, ""i'm sorry, i didn't see you.  i'll dump it out,"" and began dumping contents of the bottle of alcohol onto the sidewalk.  sergeant dunn did not order the defendant to stop drinking the alcohol or make any other show of authority.  sergeant dunn testified without objection that ""drinking alcohol in public is an arrestable offense in the [c]ity of chelsea.""  he then detained the defendant to see whether he had any active warrants.  after determining that the defendant did have an active warrant for his arrest, sergeant dunn and other officers who had arrived on scene arrested the defendant on the warrant and transported him to chelsea police headquarters.at the police station, the officers conducted an inventory of the defendant's personal property.  the defendant had $209 on his person.  the currency was separated into bundles of small denominations ""like a stack of [fifteen dollars], a stack of [twenty dollars], a stack of [fifteen dollars], like that in each pocket.""  sergeant dunn testified that he had seen united states currency bundled like that in the past ""and it's usually that way when it's involved in drug activity.""  in accordance with departmental policy, the officers removed the defendant's shoes and took his belt before he was placed in a cell.  the officers noticed a bulge protruding from the defendant's sock; when asked what it was, thepage 684defendant removed his sock and threw it to the floor.  in his sock, the police found a large plastic bag filled with fifteen individually wrapped smaller bags of heroin.the defendant's argument on appeal is that sergeant dunn was not justified in detaining him to check for warrants because drinking in public is not a crime under either the general laws of the commonwealth or the ordinances of the city of chelsea.  the defendant relies for support on a document that appears in an addendum to his brief on appeal, which he describes as the pertinent city of chelsea ordinance.  the same material appears in the commonwealth's brief on appeal.  a copy of the city of chelsea ordinance was not offered in evidence during the hearing on the motion to suppress.the defendant's argument fails for several reasons.  first and foremost, the defendant overlooks the testimony by sergeant dunn, credited by the judge, that drinking an alcoholic beverage on the street or a sidewalk in the city of chelsea is a criminal offense.  in massachusetts, the contents of a municipal bylaw or ordinance may be proved by oral testimony.  see commonwealth v. rushin,, 518 & n.6 (2002) (officer's testimony that defendant's drinking can of beer while sitting in car violated city ordinance was sufficient to prove contents of municipal law).  contrast commonwealth v. perretti,, 40 (1985) (criminal conviction for violating municipal ordinance proscribing ""peeping and spying"" was invalid because there was no evidence of contents of ordinance either in oral or documentary form).  here, sergeant dunn testified without objection that in the city of chelsea, drinking alcohol in public is an arrestable offense.  see g. l. c. 272, § 59, as appearing in st. 1981, c. 629 (providing that person who, in public, willfully violates ordinance ""the substance of which is the drinking or possession of alcoholic beverage,"" is subject to arrest).  see also commonwealth v. jones,, 296 n.1 (21013).  the detention of the defendant for purposes of conducting a check for active warrants therefore was valid, because sergeant dunn had probable cause to arrest the defendant for violating the ordinance prior to his detention.  see commonwealth v. charros,page 685, 765 (2005).  accordingly, sergeant dunn's subsequent arrest of the defendant based on an outstanding warrant was valid.  for these reasons, the defendant's motion to suppress properly was denied.while what has been said is sufficient to dispose of the defendant's argument that he was unlawfully detained before the police discovered there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest, we add this additional observation about municipal ordinances and bylaws.  courts are required to take judicial notice of the general laws of the commonwealth, statutes, and other public acts of the legislature, the common law, rules of court, the code of massachusetts regulations, and federal statutes.  furthermore, courts will take judicial notice of the contents of federal regulations, the laws of foreign jurisdictions, legislative history, and municipal charters and charter amendments when this material is called to their attention.  see mass. g. evid. § 202(a)(1) & (2) (2018).  however, the general rule here in massachusetts is that in the absence of statutory authorization, a court will not take judicial notice of a municipal ordinance.  e.g., brodsky v. fine,, 54 (1928); russell v. new bedford,, 722 (2009).  see mass. g. evid. § 202(c) (2018).the law has traditionally treated municipal ordinances as a ""peculiar species of fact, requiring formal proof"" because those materials tended to not be readily available to judges.  

2 mccormick on evidence § 335, at 334 (k.s. broun ed., 7th ed. 2013).  see, e.g., passanessi v. c.j. maney co.,, 604 (1960); peters v. haymarket leasing,, 775 n.11 (2005).  ordinarily, the contents of a municipal ordinance or bylaw is proved by offering an attested copy of the same as an exhibit.  see mariano v. building inspector of marlborough,, 666 (1968), citing g. l. c. 233, § 75.  at least one noted authority on the law of evidence has observed ""that as these materials become more accessible, the tendency is toward permitting the judges to do what perhaps they should have done in the beginning, that is, to rely on the diligence of counsel to provide the necessary materials, and accordingly to take judicial notice of all law.""  2 mccormick on evidence, supra.  we havepage 686noted that ""reliable versions of municipal ordinances and by-laws now may be as generally accessible as statutes.""  halbach v. normandy real estate partners,, 675 n.5 (2016).the time may have come for the rule prohibiting judicial notice of municipal ordinance and bylaws to be revisited by the supreme judicial court.even if we were to consider the material that both parties have included in their briefs and described as the city of chelsea ordinance, it is not inconsistent with sergeant dunn's testimony that drinking in public is a criminal offense in chelsea.  the defendant misunderstands language in that material that provides a civil alternative to what otherwise would be a criminal violation.  a municipal ordinance or bylaw that provides a criminal penalty for a violation by, for example, setting forth a schedule of fines, may also provide for a noncriminal, civil disposition of the violation.  see g. l. c. 40, § 21d.see also g. l. c. 277, § 70c.page 687the existence of an alternative civil process for the disposition of a violation of an ordinance or bylaw establishing criminal liability does not mean that the police cannot proceed with enforcement of the criminal sanction by subjecting violators to arrest pursuant to g. l. c. 272, § 59.  see commonwealth v. weston w.,, 29 (2009).  contrast, g. l. c. 94c, § 32n (directing police departments to enforce g. l. c. 94c, § 32l [possession of less than one ounce of marijuana] in accordance with the noncriminal provisions of g. l. c. 40, § 21).2.  sufficiency of the evidence.  the defendant next argues that the evidence presented against him at trial was not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to distribute the heroin found in his sock at booking.  we disagree.in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, the question is ""whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""  commonwealth v. latimore,, 677 (1979), quoting from jackson v. virginia, 443 u.s. 307, 319 (1979).  ""intent is a factual matter that may be proved by circumstantial evidence.""  commonwealth v. gonzales,, 731 (1992), quoting from commonwealth v. laperle,, 427 (1985).here, the defendant was found in possession of 1.49 grams of heroin.however, ""[t]he fact that the amount of drugs seized was small does not, by itself, require a finding of not guilty to so much of the indictment as states 'intent to distribute.'  a dealer's inventory of drugs may have been reduced before his arrest to a smallpage 688amount by a number of sales.""  ibid.  a detective with the chelsea police department provided expert testimony indicating that the manner in which the drugs were packaged -- fifteen individually wrapped plastic bags inside of a larger plastic bag -- was consistent with possession with an intent to distribute.  see ibid. (ten glassine bags bundled by elastic band evidence of intent to distribute).  moreover, the detective testified without objection that in his experience, someone possessing drugs for personal use in chelsea would typically have the drugs in a single bag and would also possess paraphernalia to use the drugs.  the defendant was not found with any paraphernalia on his person that would allow him to inject or otherwise ingest the heroin.  see commonwealth v. labitue,, 914 (2000).  the detective further described the area in which the defendant was arrested as a high drug activity area.  see commonwealth v. dancy,, 178 (2009).  finally, the defendant was found with $209, $100 of which was located in his wallet, and $109 of which was located in his pocket and stacked in fifteen and twenty dollar denominations, which is consistent with the detective's testimony that each baggie of heroin possessed by the defendant had an approximate street value of twenty dollars.  see commonwealth v. arias,, 619 n.10 (1990).based on the foregoing, the commonwealth presented sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the heroin with the intent to distribute and the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty was properly denied.3.  motion for a new trial.  the defendant argues that his motion for a new trial was improperly denied by the motion judge, who also presided over the defendant's trial.a judge ""may grant a new trial at any time if it appears that justice may not have been done.""  mass.r.crim.p. 30(b),  365 mass. 780  (1974).  our review of a decision to deny a motion for a new trial is limited to determining whether the motion judge ""committed an abuse of discretion or a significant error of law.""  commonwealth v. lys,, 720 (2017), quoting from commonwealth v. dejesus,, 178 (2014).  we grant special deference to a judge's decision on a motion for a new trial where, as here, the motion judge also acted as the trial judge.  see ibid.a.  ineffective assistance of counsel.  the defendant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to introduce a socialpage 689security letter indicating that he began receiving social security benefits in the amount of $993 per month in december, 2012, and other social security documents ""show[ing] benefits to mr. bones over the years"" as evidence of the defendant's income in an attempt to account for the money found on the defendant's person during booking.a defendant complaining of ineffective assistance must establish (1) ""serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel -- behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer . . ."" and (2) that it ""likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.""  commonwealth v. saferian,, 96 (1974).  here, the commonwealth's argument in relation to the cash found on the defendant focused on the way in which the bills were folded in groups of fifteen or twenty dollars, suggestive of a series of individual transactions consistent with the testimony about the cost of an individual bag of heroin purchased on the street.  the commonwealth did not refer to the defendant's employment status, nor argue that due to being unemployed his possession of $209 in cash could not be explained other that by assuming it was the proceeds of illegal drug sales.  moreover, the prosecutor did not make any reference to the defendant's employment status in the commonwealth's closing argument.  finally, the social security letter in the record before us does not cover the period during which the defendant was arrested, as the letter indicates that he began receiving social security benefits in december, 2012, and the defendant was arrested in april, 2012.  the letter alone thus does not provide an alternative explanation as to how the defendant came to possess the money found on his person.  while the defendant's trial counsel indicated in her affidavit that other social security records would have been helpful to the defendant had they been introduced in evidence, the defendant has failed to prove how the contents of those records would have been helpful to the defense, or to show that such records even exist.  the motion judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to submit in evidence documents concerning the defendant's receipt of social security benefits.page 690b.  testifying chemist's credentials.  the defendant further argues that his motion for a new trial should have been allowed on the basis that newly discovered evidence cast doubt on the defendant's conviction.  the defendant argues that the testifying chemist falsely asserted at trial that she earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry, when she was in fact awarded a bachelor's degree in sociology.""a defendant seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence must establish both that the evidence is newly discovered and that it casts real doubt on the justice of the conviction.""  commonwealth v. grace,, 305 (1986).  as the motion judge correctly found, even assuming that this is newly discovered evidence, see id. at 306 (newly discovered evidence is evidence not reasonably discoverable by defendant at time of trial), the information was, at best, impeachment evidence that does not rise to the level of requiring a new trial.  see commonwealth v. simmons,, 72 (1994) (""newly discovered evidence that tends merely to impeach the testimony of a witness does not ordinarily warrant a new trial"").c.  commonwealth's closing argument.  the defendant makes numerous arguments relating to the propriety of the commonwealth's closing argument, all of which lack precision.  our understanding of the defendant's argument is that the defendant objects to the following:  (1) the prosecutor's argument that it was unfair that the credibility of the testifying chemist and police officers was being undermined by annie dookhan's malfeasance, see commonwealth v. scott,(2013); (2) the prosecutor's statement that it is not the jury's job ""to give anybody a break""; and (3) the prosecutor's statement that dookhan's misconduct and its aftermath are ""a chilling thing for our whole society.""as for the defendant's first argument, the prosecutor is entitledpage 691to base his argument on the evidence and the fair inferences drawn therefrom.  see commonwealth v. kozec,, 516 (1987).  here, the defendant attempted to undermine the validity of the drug certificate and the testimony of the commonwealth's witnesses by referencing the misconduct of dookhan.  the prosecutor properly argued that the evidence elicited at trial indicated that dookhan did not taint the drug samples admitted in evidence, and that the chemist reported dookhan's misconduct to her supervisor.  the commonwealth's closing argument was proper in this respect, as it was based on the evidence admitted at trial and the fair inferences drawn therefrom.  the defendant's second argument must also fail because the prosecutor was entitled to argue that the evidence showed that the defendant was guilty in spite of dookan's misconduct and that the jurors have a duty to make a determination as to the defendant's guilt based on the admissible evidence before them.  see commonwealth v. payton,, 597-598 (1993).  third, the prosecutor's statement that dookhan's misconduct is a ""chilling thing for our whole society"" was best left unsaid, as it was arguably based on the prosecutor's knowledge of events outside of the record in this case.  however, we do not believe that this statement prejudiced the defendant because, as the evidence showed, dookhan was not involved in the testing of the drugs in this case.  furthermore, the judge gave a strong curative instruction indicating that the evidence about dookhan and the hinton drug lab were properly admitted as relevant to the issues before the jury in response to defense counsel's objection to this statement.see kozec, supra at 518.  finally, we note that the commonwealth's closing argument, while critical of the defense mounted by the defendant, did not ""constitute[] an overly aggressive response"" to the defendant's challenging of the validity of the drug certificate and testimony of the chemist.  commonwealth v. lopes,, 607 (2018).judgment affirmed.order denying motion for new

[698-701] rubin, j., dissenting in part.","the plaintiff, aa&d masonry, llc (aa&d), appeals from a judgment dismissing its complaint on statute of limitations grounds.  as will be discussed in more detail below,page 694this is the latest in a series of actions brought by aa&d to obtain payment for masonry work it performed in 2009, in connection with the construction of an office park (the project) on property owned by the defendant, south street business park, llc (south street).  the first case resulted in default judgments against south street and the project's contractor, crowsnest corporation (crowsnest).  the present complaint was filed on october 30, 2015, and asserts claims against south street, its principal, david a. franchi, and members of david's family including olga l. franchi (mother), domenic franchi (father), john s. franchi (brother), and lisa m. carroll (sister).aa&d claims that each of the individual defendants had sufficient involvement and ownership interest in south street to be held liable for south street's breach of contract and the default judgment under the theory of piercing the corporate veil.  for the reasons that follow, we conclude that the complaint was properly dismissed.background.  we summarize the facts alleged in aa&d's complaint and describe the history of prior related litigation in order to provide context for our discussion of the issues.on or about january 6, 2009, aa&d entered into a written contract with crowsnest for the benefit of south street to furnish masonry labor and materials to the project.the contract sum was $409,452.  the complaint alleges that aa&d was induced to enter the contract by south street and crowsnest through representations of the project manager that aa&d would be paid in installments from the proceeds of a construction loan from wells fargo bank, n.a. (wells fargo), which was secured by a mortgage on the property.aa&d completed its work in june of 2009, but it was not paid as promised.  this led aa&d to file a mechanic's lien under g. l.page 695c. 254, § 4.  aa&d recorded a notice of the contract and a statement of account in the middlesex south district registry of deeds on june 29, 2009, and august 26, 2009, respectively.  by that time, as aa&d subsequently learned, south street had granted a mortgage to olga in the amount of $4,750,000.the mortgage was secured by the property and recorded at the same registry on march 12, 2009.  a discharge of that mortgage was recorded shortly thereafter, on march 25, 2009.on august 27, 2009, aa&d commenced an action to enforce its mechanic's lien against crowsnest, south street, and wells fargo as a party in interest.  neither crowsnest nor south street filed a response to the complaint.on april 21, 2010, aa&d obtained separate default judgments against south street and crowsnest, in the amount of $409,452 plus interest (the south street judgment).no portion of the south street judgment has been paid to aa&d.more than three years later, on or about january 11, 2013, aa&d filed a new lawsuit against crowsnest, david, and olga, alleging that david, a principal of crowsnest, and olga, a de facto principal, were jointly and severally liable with crowsnest for contempt for nonpayment of the south street judgment.  the complaint further alleged claims of fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, conversion, and violation of g. l. c. 93a (the 2013 case).olga moved to dismiss the complaint in the 2013 case under mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6),  365 mass. 754  (1974).  in its opposition to olga's motion, filed on march 4, 2013, aa&d asserted that (1) ""[t]he public records of this court and middlesex south [r]egistrypage 696of [d]eeds indicate a pattern by david franchi to defraud his creditors through his corporate entities.  in some instances this appears to have been accomplished with the assistance of his mother, olga franchi""; (2) ""[a] search of david franchi's name through the trial court information center reveals dozens of suits were filed in middlesex superior court by creditors and contractors against him and the corporate entities in which he was a principal""; (3) in addition to its suit, aa&d had discovered at least three other suits filed against crowsnest and south street by subcontractors alleging nonpayment for work on the project; and (4) aa&d had recently discovered, from records relating to an action on the mortgage filed in superior court by wells fargo against south street and david, that david and south street had defaulted on the construction loan in april of 2009.  aa&d pointed specifically to the $4,750,000 mortgage to olga, as recorded in the middlesex south district registry of deeds (and a copy of which was attached to aa&d's opposition), as evidence of collusion and fraud because it showed that olga was involved in diverting funds from the wells fargo loan.  aa&d argued that the timing of south street's april 1, 2009, default on the wells fargo loan ""is curious because it comes immediately after south street granted olga franchi a mortgage in the amount of $4,750,000 and discharged the same in less than thirty days.""ultimately, olga's motion to dismiss the complaint was allowed.  aa&d appealed, and the judgment of dismissal as to olga was affirmed in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to our rule 1:28.  see aa&d masonry, llc v. franchi, 87 mass. app. ct. 1136 (2015).  no final judgment appears to have entered with respect to david and crowsnest.as indicated, aa&d brought this superior court action on october 30, 2015.  the allegations in the current complaint mirror those asserted in the 2013 case (albeit with more particularity) and are primarily as follows:  (1) south street fraudulently diverted loan proceeds from wells fargo to other entities owned and controlled by the individual defendants; (2) the defendants confused and intermingled the assets of south street and their other entities while failing to observe corporate formalities; (3) on february 25, 2009, south street fraudulently granted olga apage 697mortgage in the amount of $4,750,000; (4) south street defaulted multiple times on the wells fargo loan and concealed that fact from aa&d; (5) david and crowsnest also concealed from aa&d that they had been sued by another contractor in connection with the project; and (6) the individual defendants are de facto principals, owners, and alter egos of south street and, as such, they controlled and managed south street directly or through david as their agent.  aa&d's complaint seeks relief for contempt of the south street judgment (count i), fraud in the inducement (count ii), conversion (count iii), unjust enrichment (count iv), and violations of g. l. c. 93a (count v).  it also seeks, in count vi, to pierce the corporate veil to hold the individual defendants liable for south street's conduct as stated in counts ii through v.the defendants filed motions to dismiss aa&d's complaint on the ground, among others, that counts ii through vi are barred by the applicable statutes of limitations, the longest of which is six years.  they maintained that aa&d was harmed in 2009, when it was not paid from the proceeds of the wells fargo loan as promised.  aa&d did not dispute that the applicable statutes of limitations had expired unless tolling applied.rather, it argued that it was entitled to tolling of the limitations periods under the discovery rule and the fraudulent concealment statute, g. l. c. 260, § 12, because it could not reasonably have discovered the identity of those responsible for its injury until 2013, when it obtained documents related to the wells fargo loan.aa&d did not argue in its oppositions, as it argues now, that count vi included an action on an unsatisfied judgment and was subject to a twenty-year period of limitations.  see g. l. c. 235,page 698§ 19.the motion judge therefore did not address that issue.  after judgment entered, aa&d filed a motion to reconsider in which it raised this claim for the first time.  no action appears to have been taken on the motion for reconsideration, nor was it the subject of a notice of appeal.  we decline to address the issue.  see commissioner of rev. v. comcast corp.,, 312-313 (2009) (new legal theory presented for the first time in motion for reconsideration is waived).the motion judge concluded that aa&d's claims are time-barred because no tolling applies, and dismissed the complaint pursuant to mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6).  on appeal, aa&d does not challenge the dismissal of count one.  for substantially the reasons articulated by the judge, we conclude that the statutes of limitations on aa&d's remaining claims were not tolled.  we therefore affirm the judgment of dismissal.discussion.  ""we review the allowance of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.""  harrington v. costello,, 724 (2014).

""[t]he factual inquiry focuses on which was the first event reasonably likely to put the plaintiff on notice that the defendant's conduct had caused him injury.""  ibid.as previously noted, aa&d asserts that its causes of action against the individual defendants did not accrue until march or april of 2014.  according to aa&d, it could not with reasonable diligence have discovered that the defendants were responsible for its injury before reviewing various documents that were obtained while conducting discovery in connection with the 2013 case.  those documents allegedly show that (1) david is not the sole owner of south street, (2) john and lisa (together with david) were coguarantors of the wells fargo loan, (3) south street maintained a working capital account at middlesex savings bank and loan proceeds were deposited into that account and then almost immediately transferred to other bank accounts in the name of other entities the defendants owned and controlled, and (4) a notice of default on behalf of wells fargo to south street dated august 20, 2008, specified that the basis for the claim of default was the failure of the borrower to utilize loan proceeds exclusively for the development project as required by the loan documents.  (see note 11, supra.)the problem with aa&d's argument is that we test the accrual of a cause of action by what a reasonable person in the plaintiff's position would have known ""or on inquiry would have discovered at the various relevant times.""  bowen v. eli lilly & co., supra at 210.  we believe that a reasonably prudent plaintiff in aa&d's position, upon not being paid any of the over $400,000 due after six months of contracted labor, would have madepage 700inquiries to determine how the wells fargo construction loan proceeds had been spent.  see friedman v. jablonski,, 486 (1976) (as of time of sale, plaintiff buyers bringing action for deceit in connection with sale of real estate could have taken steps to discover misrepresentations and therefore cause of action accrued at that time).it is clear that aa&d would have learned that other contractors had not been paid, that south street had defaulted on the wells fargo loan both before and after contracting with aa&d, and that a ""fraudulent"" mortgage had been granted to olga and discharged ten days later, had aa&d followed up on information that was available through the trial court information center or recorded in the middlesex south district registry of deeds in 2009, as it apparently did before filing its opposition to the motion to dismiss in the 2013 case.there are no allegations in the complaint that support the inference that aa&d was able to discover this information in 2013, but not in 2009.  indeed, all of the documents upon which aa&d currently relies to establish fraud and collusion were created in 2009 (see note 11, supra), and could have been obtained by aa&d when it filed its complaint to enforce its mechanics lien.  we therefore conclude that aa&d failed to exercise its duty of reasonable inquiry and, as a result, the discovery rule does not protect aa&d's complaint from dismissal on statute of limitations grounds.  see harrington v. costello, 467 mass. at 730 n.17.2.  general laws c. 260, § 12.  equally unavailing is aa&d's contention that the statutes of limitations were tolled due to thepage 701defendants' fraudulent concealment of material facts which prevented it from learning their individual identities and the extent of their involvement in diverting funds from the wells fargo loan.see g. l. c. 260, § 12 (excluding for statute of limitations purposes the period before the plaintiff becomes aware of his cause of action ""[i]f a person liable to a personal action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled to bring it"").  even accepting for the purposes of this appeal aa&d's allegations that the defendants took actions to conceal their financial circumstances, those actions did not give rise to aa&d's injury.  aa&d was injured in 2009, when it was not paid as promised from the proceeds of the wells fargo loan.  aa&d immediately was aware of its injury and, as we have already discussed, it was or should have been aware of potentially fraudulent conduct when reasonable inquiry would have uncovered the $4,750,000 mortgage granted to olga.  consequently, and despite the alleged collusion between the defendants, the statutes of limitations were not tolled under g. l. c. 260, § 12.judgment affirmed.the defendants' motions to dismiss the lawsuit of plaintiff aa&d masonry, llc (aa&d), were allowed on statutes of limitations grounds.  aa&d now appeals.  because i believe the court majority misapprehends both the doctrine of ""inquiry notice"" and the significance of recording documents with the registry of deeds, i must respectfully dissent.in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the allegations of the complaint, and all reasonable inferences favoring the plaintiff that may be drawn therefrom, must be taken as true.  see harrington v. costello,, 724 (2014).  the complaint allegespage 702that the defendant south street business park, llc (south street), and crowsnest corporation (crowsnest), an entity owned by defendant david franchi, were involved in a joint enterprise to develop commercially a parcel of real estate in marlborough.  in february, 2008, south street obtained a construction loan from wells fargo bank in the original principal amount of $9,550,000 which funds were required to be used exclusively for the construction project in marlborough.  in january, 2009, aa&d entered into a written contract with crowsnest for the benefit of south street to furnish masonry labor and materials for the project for the sum of $409,452.  the complaint alleges that aa&d was induced to enter the contract by south street and crowsnest through representations of the project manager that aa&d would be paid in installments from the proceeds of the wells fargo loan.  and indeed the written agreement itself provided that payments would be made no later than ten days after receipt by crowsnest of payment from south street and/or wells fargo.aa&d completed the work in june, 2009, but was not paid for it.  aa&d subsequently filed a mechanic's lien, which, in august, 2009, it sought to enforce by filing a complaint in superior court against south street and crowsnest.  a default judgment was entered in the principal sum of $409,452.  south street has not satisfied any portion of that judgment.in its complaint aa&d alleges that, unbeknownst to it, south street defaulted multiple times in its obligations to wells fargo under the loan, both prior to and after contracting with aa&d.  aa&d alleges that south street maintained a working capital account at middlesex savings bank, and that loan proceeds were deposited into the account and then almost immediately transferred into other bank accounts in the name of other entities the defendants owned and controlled.  during just the six-month time period from january of 2009 to june of 2009, approximately $1,406,000 of deposits into the middlesex savings bank account were diverted to these other entities.  and, indeed, a notice of default on behalf of wells fargo bank to south street dated august 20, 2008, specifies that the basis for the claim of default was the failure of the borrower to utilize loan proceeds exclusively for the development project as required by the loan documents.attached to the opposition to the motions to dismiss were, among other things, a repayment and completion guaranteepage 703signed by three of the individual defendants, david franchi, john franchi, and lisa carroll.  it guaranteed the $9,550,000 note to wells fargo bank, and also guaranteed ""the performance by [south street] of all the terms and provisions of the loan agreement,"" implying the guarantors maintained a level of control over south street.  the complaint alleges that all the individual defendants were at all material times members or owners of south street, as well as its alter egos, who controlled and managed south street directly and/or through defendant david franchi as their agent, and that they were all partners or principals in the joint venture to commercially develop the subject property.count i of the complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim, and the plaintiff has not appealed that ruling.  count ii alleges fraud in the inducement; count iii conversion and misappropriation; count iv unjust enrichment; and count v violations of g. l. c. 93a.  count vi does not articulate a stand-alone cause of action.  as the majority explains, it articulates a corporate veil-piercing theory of liability against the individual defendants with respect to counts ii through v.  consequently, we are concerned only with the statutes of limitations with respect to those latter counts, which range from three to six years.this case was brought more than six years after the failure of crowsnest to pay aa&d's bill.  the question therefore is when the causes of action accrued, starting the statute of limitations clock.

      aa&d alleges that it could not have known of the relevant facts underlying these causes of action until the wells fargo loan documents and the middlesex savings bank records were provided to it in discovery in a related action in march and april of 2014.  although i agree with the method of analysis employed by the court majority, i think it goes astray in concluding that aa&d's contention is wrong.under the discovery rule, ""a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or with reasonable diligence should have discovered that (1) he has suffered harm; (2) his harm was caused by the conduct of another; and (3) the defendant is the person whopage 704caused that harm.""  harrington v. costello, 467 mass. at 727.  with respect to the defendants listed on the loan guarantee, i disagree with the court majority's conclusion that with reasonable diligence the plaintiff could have adduced the existence of its causes of action against them more than six, or even three, years prior to initiation of the suit.the court majority concludes (a) that aa&d should have been aware of a mortgage to olga franchi for $4.75 million that was recorded in march of 2009, (b) that this mortgage should have put aa&d on ""inquiry notice"" that something fraudulent was happening with respect to the loan proceeds, and (c) that based on that notice aa&d should have discovered the documents that reveal the basis for its claims, documents indicating that there were three unknown guarantors of the wells fargo loan and that funds from the loan were siphoned to entities they controlled.  see ante at 699-700. each of these conclusions warrants examination.to begin with, the majority holds that aa&d should have been aware of the olga franchi mortgage simply because it was recorded.  to be sure, aa&d had discovered the mortgage by 2013, and it may be that there is some reason peculiar to the plaintiff in this case why it ""had no difficulty"" in finding it, such that, as the majority holds, aa&d should have discovered it earlier.  ante at note 14.  but the majority relies on the simple fact that the mortgage was recorded in support of its conclusion that aa&d should have found it.the only way to ensure one is aware of all recorded documents with respect to a piece of property is of course to undertake a comprehensive title search.  i see no reason for an unpaid worker, supplier, contractor, or subcontractor who files and records a mechanic's lien with the registry of deeds, as aa&d did, to undertake such a search.  unlike a purchaser or mortgagee, who must in order to protect itself examine the title to a piece of property, one recording a mechanic's lien has no reason to engage in a comprehensive title search nor to undertake the expense involved in doing so.i would not hold as the majority does that one who files a mechanic's lien is as a matter of law put ""onpage 705inquiry"" by recorded documents that might have been found in a title search; i believe that doing so will impose unnecessary costs, and create unnecessary complications, for the ""contractors, subcontractors, laborers, and suppliers"" who routinely utilize such liens ""to provide security . . . for the value of their services and goods provided for improving the owner's real estate.""  hammill-mccormick assocs., inc. v. new england tel. & tel. co.,, 542-543 (1987).next, and perhaps more fundamental to this case, even had aa&d been aware of the mortgage, standing alone it presents no reason to suspect a diversion of loan funds to anyone.  it is not a disbursement of funds, but an additional debt obligation.  borrowing additional funds cannot put one on notice as a matter of law that there is a problem with the way in which the proceeds of a previous mortgage are being utilized.  and while the discharge of the mortgage so quickly might in some circumstances have raised suspicions, there is no reason to believe that aa&d knew, three to six years before the suit was filed, that the mortgage had been discharged,nor is there any basis for a conclusion that someone in aa&d's position,page 706who had done work, not been paid, and filed and recorded a mechanic's lien, should have known of the discharge.  further, ""inquiry notice"" merely imposes an obligation to investigate; it does not mean that a party can be charged with constructive knowledge of a fact that reasonable investigation should not or could not have revealed.  so, even if aa&d should have known of the olga franchi mortgage because it was recorded, and even if, standing alone, that mortgage did suggest something nefarious, putting aa&d on some kind of inquiry notice, the court majority does not explain why the mortgage should have sent it looking for the critical loan guarantee from wells fargo.nor does the majority's explanation of how, exactly, aa&d was supposed to obtain the loan guarantee and south street's bank records stand up to scrutiny.  first, the majority says ""aa&d could have conducted discovery before moving for a default judgment"" in the 2009 case, or gotten postjudgment discovery under mass.r.civ.p. 69,  365 mass. 836  (1974).  ante at note 13.  but the defendants in that case, south street and crowsnest, did not even file an answer in the 2009 case -- perhaps precisely to avoid discovery -- resulting in judgments against them of over $400,000, which they have not paid in the ensuing years, even as interest accrues.  a default ends the case.  the idea that in those circumstances the defendants would have responded to discovery requests, or -- more to the point -- that a plaintiff facing such defendants can be held not to have undertaken a diligent investigation for not making some such requests, either before moving for a default judgment, or after judgment under rule 69, would impose a costly and largely purposeless burden on both the litigant who has done nothing wrong and the courts, and would give a windfall to those who default and seek to avoid judgments rightly entered against them.the majority also says that ""aa&d also could have obtained most of the documents from wells fargo, who was named as a party in interest in the 2013 case.""  ante at note 13.  of course wells fargo would have had only the loan documents, not south street's bank records, but even passing that, i find it exceedingly unlikely a mortgage lender would provide such records to a third party without a court order even assuming it would be lawful for it to do so, a question unbriefed before us.  and, notwithstandingpage 707the majority's conclusion that the olga franchi mortgage put the plaintiff on inquiry notice, i find it very difficult to imagine a court on the basis of that mortgage ordering wells fargo to turn over all the relevant loan documents, including the critical loan guarantee signed by three previously unknown individuals.i thus do not see how aa&d could with reasonable diligence have discovered the three guarantors of the loan until the documents were turned over in discovery in the related action in 2014.  consequently, i would hold that the discovery rule prevented the causes of action against those three individuals from accruing until that time, and that, consequently, the claims against those defendants were brought timely in the instant action.likewise, until it obtained the bank records from middlesex savings bank, the plaintiff could not have known that, rather than simply running out of money on the project,south street diverted funds from the loan to entities controlled by domenic, john, and lisa carroll, which is the operative set of facts with respect to these causes of action.i therefore would reverse the dismissal of counts ii through vi of the complaint as to defendants south street, domenic franchi, john franchi, and lisa carroll on these independent bases.  and, even if i am mistaken that the discovery-rule issue can be decided as a matter of law in favor of aa&d, it is certainly clear that when, exactly, aa&d should have known of these causes of action presents at least a jury question rendering the dismissal of these counts improper.  see riley v. presnell,, 240 (1991) (""[w]hen a plaintiff knew or should have known of his cause of action is one of fact which in most instances will be decided by the trier of fact"").the defendants olga franchi and david franchi stand on a somewhat different footing.  in the related suit filed in january of 2013, olga franchi and david franchi were named as defendants.  aa&d argued in that case that there was a diversion of funds from the project to olga, evidenced by the repayment of her mortgage and its recorded discharge in 2009.  a final judgment (which was affirmed on appeal) was entered as to olga franchi in that case and it is thus res judicata as to her.  likewise, because that case is still pending against david franchi, this case is barred as to him by mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(9), as amended,  450 mass. 1403  (2008).  dismissal as to those two defendants was thus appropriate.page 708for these reasons i respectfully dissent with respect to so much of the judgment as dismissed the claims against south street, domenic franchi, john franchi, and lisa carroll.  i would affirm so much of the judgment as dismissed the claims against david franchi and olga franchi.",civil,None,affirm

[715-716]","the defendant, steven bouley, appeals from hispage 710conviction by a district court jury of operating a vehicle under the influence of drugs (oui), g. l. c. 90, § 24(1)(a)(1), second offense, following a single-car accident.a responding emergency medical technician (emt)testified that, in his opinion, the defendant was actively overdosing at the scene of the accident, and this testimony was corroborated by the observations of a responding police officer and the defendant's admission to having taken fentanyl.  we conclude that the jury could convict the defendant without additional proof as to the amount or concentration of narcotics in the defendant's system or expert testimony regarding how that amount or concentration would impair a defendant's ability to operate a vehicle safely.  concluding as well that the trial judge's implicit qualification of the emt as an expert was proper and that the trial record does not set forth the factual basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we affirm.1.  background.  at approximately 9:00 p.m. on may 24, 2015, a lawrence police officer and an emt affiliated with lawrence general hospital responded to the scene of a single-car accident at an intersection in lawrence.  the officer arrived less than five minutes after the accident was reported, observing that the vehicle appeared to have struck a fire call box on the side of the road and rolled back into the intersection.  the defendant was hanging partially out of the vehicle with his feet inside the open driver's side door and his body lying face-up on the street.the defendant was unconscious, with pinpoint pupils, and was barely breathing as the emt and other paramedics arrived.  a fireman gave the defendant a sternal rub, but the defendant could not be resuscitated.  based on his observation of the defendant and his experience in responding to hundreds of drug overdoses in over eighteen years as a certified paramedic, the emt believed the defendant was actively overdosing.  following his training, the emt administered narcan, an emergency medication used to treat opioid overdoses.  the emt testified that narcan serves no medical purpose other than to bind to opioids in a person's system and allow the body to restore natural respiration, and that it would not revive a person who was not breathing as a result ofpage 711any other condition.  the defendant responded to the narcan immediately; his pupils dilated, he began breathing normally, and he awoke in an agitated state.  the emt stated all of the defendant's signs and symptoms -- including his response to the narcan -- were consistent with an overdose caused by ingesting opioid narcotics.the defendant, now awake and alert, spoke with the emt and the police officer, responding appropriately and coherently to questions.  he admitted to the emt that he had taken fentanyl, a synthetic opioid painkiller, and he told the officer he owned the vehicle and was driving at the time of the accident.  the defendant, however, said he believed the accident was caused by malfunctioning because of recent repairs to the car's drive shaft.the defendant also said he hit his head, and there was a slight red mark on his forehead, but there was no sign of a concussion, brain trauma, or any other injury to the defendant.  the accident did not appear particularly severe or life-threatening, and there was no evidence of any internal impact or trauma that would have impaired the defendant's breathing.after the defendant was taken to the hospital, the officer conducted an inventory search of the vehicle.  he found a needle and syringe on the driver's seat floor - items commonly used to ingest narcotics.the defendant was tried for oui by a district court jury.  during the trial, the judge denied the defendant's motions for a required finding of not guilty both at the close of the commonwealth's case and at the close of all the evidence.  the jury convicted the defendant.2.  sufficiency of the evidence.  ""when reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, 'we consider the evidence introduced at trial in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'""  commonwealth v. faherty,, 133 (2018), quoting from commonwealth v. oberle,, 547 (2017).  ""the inferences that support a convictionpage 712'need only be reasonable and possible; [they] need not be necessary or inescapable.'""  commonwealth v. waller,, 303 (2016), quoting from commonwealth v. woods,, 713 (2014).  this determination, moreover, ""is to be measured upon that which was admitted in evidence without regard to the propriety of the admission.""  commonwealth v. sepheus,, 164 (2014), quoting from commonwealth v. farnsworth,, 98 (2010).to prove the crime of operating a motor vehicle under the influence of a narcotic drug under g. l. c. 90, § 24(1)(a)(1), the commonwealth was required to establish that the defendant (1) physically operated a vehicle; (2) on a public way; (3) while under the influence of a narcotic drug.  see commonwealth v. ferola, 72 mass. app. ct. 170, 172-173 (2008); commonwealth v. gallagher,, 392 (2017).  the defendant here contests only the final element, which is established by showing that the use of a narcotic drug resulted in the ""impairment, to any degree, of an individual's ability to safely perform the activity in question.""  commonwealth v. veronneau,, 479 (2016).temporarily setting aside whether the emt's testimony was properly admitted (an issue we address, infra), see sepheus, 468 mass. at 164, the evidence was sufficient to prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  the jury heard testimony from an emt who was a certified paramedic, experienced in hundreds of drug overdoses, that, shortly after exhibiting the classic symptoms of an opioid overdose and being resuscitated by medication exclusively used for treating opioid overdoses, the defendant admitted to having taken fentanyl.  see gallagher, 91 mass. app. ct. at 390-392 (affirming oui conviction where defendant admitted to consuming alcohol and ""exhibited classic symptoms of alcohol intoxication"").  it is undisputed, moreover, that the defendant was found in that condition outside of the driver's seat of a car he admitted to driving only minutes after it crashed into a call box on the side of the road.  see commonwealth v. reynolds,, 219 (2006) (jury may infer impairment by intoxicating substance from ""the manner in which the accident occurred, and the defendant's conduct . . . immediately after the collision"").  this evidence was corroborated by testimony from an experienced police officer, who also collected a needle and syringe from the driver's seat floor of the defendant's vehicle.considering that the defendant was unconscious and barely breathing at the scene of the accident, the jury could reasonablypage 713infer that whatever amount of fentanyl he took was sufficient to impair his capacity to operate the car safely.  see commonwealth v. adonsoto,, 510 (2016) (""slurred speech"" and ""unsteadiness when standing""); gallagher, 91 mass. app. ct. at 392-393 (""classic symptoms"" of intoxication).  see also reynolds, 67 mass. app. ct. at 219-220 (evidence of accident, defendant's appearance thereafter, and admission to taking narcotics supported inference that defendant's ability to drive safely was impaired at the time).contrary to the defendant's contention, this case is not like commonwealth v. shellenberger,(2005).   there, the defendant operated a van at excessive speed, passed vehicles in a no-passing zone, and ultimately caused a fatal crash.  id. at 71-72.  the commonwealth relied upon hospital records showing that the defendant tested positive for amphetamines to argue that the defendant's use of amphetamines made her operation negligent.id. at 73-74.  we reversed, as ""the amphetamine theory of criminal liability . . . lacked evidentiary foundation - both by way of any evidence concerning the concentration of amphetamines in the defendant's system as well as any expert evidence concerning the effect of such substances on her ability to drive.""  id. at 75-76.  in short, the mere fact that the defendant had amphetamines in her system was not a proper basis for an argument that the amphetamines impaired her ability to drive.here, by contrast, there is much more than the mere presence of an opioid in the defendant's system.  the defendant had enough fentanyl in his system to render him unconscious and barely capable of breathing, much less operating a motor vehicle.  he admitted to using fentanyl, responded to narcan in a manner consistent with an overdose, and had struck a fire call box with his motor vehicle.  thus, the evidence before the jury was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that the defendant had consumed an excessive amount of fentanyl and that the fentanyl affected his ability to operate a motor vehicle.  shellenberger requires that these factors be demonstrated to show impairment caused by drug use; it is not necessary that they be demonstrated by expert medical testimony.page 7143.  admissibility of the evidence.  we now turn to whether the trial judge properly allowed the emt to testify that, in his opinion, the defendant was overdosing on narcotics at the scene of the accident.""[d]eterminations as to the admissibility of evidence lie 'within the sound discretion of the trial judge,'"" commonwealth v. bins,, 364 (2013), quoting from commonwealth v. jones,, 19-20 (2012), an abuse of which ""occurs only where the judge makes 'a clear error of judgment in weighing' the factors relevant to the decision . . ., such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives.""  commonwealth v. keown,, 242 (2017), quoting from l.l. v. commonwealth,, 185 n.27 (2014).  we discern no such abuse of discretion here.""the judge is not required to hold a voir dire before qualifying an expert, and the judge's determination may be inferred from the record.""  commonwealth v. calderon,, 593 (2006) (citation omitted).  a judge may implicitly qualify an experienced, certified emt as an expert, and ""[i]t was not necessary for the judge expressly to qualify [the emt] as an expert.""  commonwealth v. ruiz,, 834 (2004).  here, the testifying emt was a certified paramedic with over eighteen years of experience.  he had responded to hundreds of calls in which an individual was suspected of having overdosed.  he had received training in treating overdoses with narcan.  accordingly, the judge acted within his discretion in implicitly qualifying the emt as an expert and allowing him to offer an opinion about the defendant's overdosing.  see ibid.;   commonwealth v. phillips,, 636 n.13 (2008).furthermore, on balance, the emt's opinion was not unfairly prejudicial against the defendant, as this case does not present the ""danger posed by a witness,. . . offering an opinion regarding a defendant's guilt '[where] the jury might forego independent analysis of the facts and bow too readily to the opinion of an expert or otherwise influential witness.'""  commonwealth v. canty,, 542-543 (2013), quoting from commonwealth v. lacorte,, 705 (1977).  rather, independent of the challenged opinion, there was evidence that the defendant (1) admitted to taking fentanyl; (2) was found at the scene of an accident; (3) unresponsive and barely breathing; (4) untilpage 715revived by a widely-known opioid antidote; (5) outside a vehicle he admitted to driving and which contained a needle and syringe near the driver's seat.  the jury thus had ample evidence with which to evaluate the weight and persuasiveness of the emt's opinion.  compare gallagher, 91 mass. app. ct. at 389-390 (""in view of the whole case, the prejudice flowing from [opinion as to defendant's impairment] would be relatively modest given what must have been obvious to the jury""), with shellenberger, 64 mass. app. ct. at 76-77 (""the evidence of the mere presence of [narcotics] cannot justify the verdict and the supplemental theory of proof advanced by the commonwealth"").  in sum, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's admission of the emt's testimony that, in his opinion, the defendant experienced an opioid-induced overdose.4.  ineffective assistance of counsel.  pretermitting the first prong of commonwealth v. saferian,, 96 (1974), there is no evidence in the trial record to support the claim that counsel's conduct ""likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence[.]""  commonwealth v. navarro,, 254 (2016), quoting from saferian, supra.  on direct appeal, assertions of ineffective assistance succeed ""only where 'the factual basis of the . . . claim appears indisputably on the trial record.'""  commonwealth v. diaz,, 289 (2007), quoting from commonwealth v. zinser,, 811 (2006).  crucially, ""[a] claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to call an expert witness is generally doomed where '[t]he defendant's claim is not supported by any affidavits' to disclose the content of the omitted expert testimony.""  commonwealth v. alicea,, 850-851 (2013), quoting from commonwealth v. morales,, 785 (2012).  accord commonwealth v. seino,, 474 (2018).the defendant here provided no affidavit describing how expert testimony would have demonstrated the accident was caused by mechanical issues, nor does the record before us otherwise suggest such testimony could have assisted the defendant's case in any meaningful way given the evidence against him.  see commonwealth v. belliveau,, 836 (2010), quoting from saferian, 366 mass. at 96 (""regardless, given the overwhelming evidence of his intoxication, it certainly did not 'deprive[] the defendant of an otherwise available, substantialpage 716ground of defence'"").  this claim fails as a result.  see alicea, 464 mass. at 851.judgment affirmed.",criminal,John F.

1696,commonwealth  vs.  jeremy grafton.,"fire prevention.  practice, criminal, required finding, affirmative defense, presumptions and burden of proof.this court concluded that a defendant in a criminal prosecution for disconnecting and removing a fire protection device in violation of g. l. c. 148, § 27a, must raise authority (i.e., procurement of a permit to do so) as an affirmative defense and produce some evidence to support it in order to shift to the commonwealth the burden of disproving it. [719-723]","after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of disconnecting and removing fire protection devices -- smoke detectors -- in violation of g. l. c. 148, § 27a.the statute requires that such devices may not be removed or disconnected without a permit.the defendant appeals, arguing that, because the procurement of a permit is an element of the crime, the judgepage 718erred in denying his motion for a required finding of not guilty and in improperly instructing the jury.  the issue is whether failure to obtain a permit to remove the fire protection devices is an element of the offense -- which the commonwealth always must prove beyond a reasonable doubt -- or whether the defendant must raise the permit issue as an affirmative defense and produce some evidence to support it, in order to shift to the commonwealth the burden of disproving it.  here, we agree with the judge that the defendant was entitled to raise the issue as an affirmative defense, but that, if he did not, the commonwealth was not required to disprove it.  for that reason, we affirm the judgment.background.  the jury heard the following evidence.  on the afternoon of july 29, 2015, sergio munos was the property manager of the three-story, two-family house at 12 munroe avenue in waltham; a family lived on one side of the house and the other side functioned, essentially, as a rooming house with seven bedrooms.munos was responsible for renting those bedrooms as well as for providing maintenance for the entire property, along with several other properties.around noon, munos drove into the parking lot of the house, intending to address an issue a tenant had reported to him -- a leaking toilet.  as he did so, he observed the defendant walking from the direction of the back door of the house toward trash barrels a short distance away; the defendant was carrying a large plastic grocery bag.  munos could see that fire extinguishers and smoke detectors were in the bag that the defendant was carrying.  when munos approached the defendant to speak with him, the defendant looked ""surprised,"" walked quickly to the trash barrels, and threw the bag he was carrying into one of the barrels.  when munos tried to speak to him, the defendant walked away, ""scream[ing]"" at munos but refusing to answer any questions.munos recognized the contents of the bag -- now in the trash barrel -- as two fire extinguishers and two smoke detectors that he previously had installed in the house.  the fire extinguisherspage 719had been installed in the kitchen and in the common area; the smoke detectors had been installed on the second-floor hallway ceiling and on the third-floor hallway ceiling.  munos took photographs of the items in the trash barrel and then retrieved the items from the trash, reinstalled them back in the house, and contacted the police.the owner of the property testified that, at the time of the incident, eviction proceedings against the defendant were already pending.after the commonwealth rested, defense counsel moved for a required finding of not guilty, arguing that the commonwealth had offered no evidence that the defendant did not possess a permit to remove the smoke detectors.  the judge denied the motion, ruling that the question of a permit was ""a defense.""the defendant testified in his own defense and denied removing the fire extinguishers or the smoke detectors; he claimed that he was out of the house the entire day.  he also testified that he was present when a health inspector came to the house the following day, july 30, 2015.  according to the defendant, the health inspector had come in response to the defendant's request to have the building inspected because of ""mice, cockroaches, [and] soiled carpet.""  the defendant testified that he became aware of the missing smoke detectors only as a result of this health inspection.  at the close of all of the evidence, during the charge conference, defense counsel renewed her argument that failure to obtain the necessary permit was an element of the commonwealth's proof.  the judge declined to give that instruction to the jury.in reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, we assess the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, along with reasonable inferences therefrom, to determine whether we are satisfied that the commonwealth presentedpage 720""enough evidence that could have satisfied a rational trier of fact of each . . . element beyond a reasonable doubt.""  commonwealth v. torres,, 292 (2014), quoting from commonwealth v. latimore,, 677-678 (1979).  the jury's inferences must only be reasonable and possible.  torres, supra.the defendant argues that it was error to deny his motion for a required finding of not guilty and his request for a jury instruction on the issue of the necessary permit.  he contends that, in cases where the behavior at issue is the norm, e.g., operating a motor vehicle, the commonwealth bears the burden of proving that the behavior was unlicensed or uninsured.  by contrast, for conduct that is generally prohibited, e.g., possession of a firearm, ""the burden is on the defendant to come forward with evidence of the defense.""  commonwealth v. jones,, 406 (1977).  in the defendant's view, handling fire protection devices is more like the former than the latter.the issue for us, then, is whether, in the circumstances presented -- removing fire protection devices -- the absence of a permit is an essential element of the offense or an affirmative defense.  we are satisfied that obtaining the necessary permit here is an affirmative defense.""an affirmative defense is defined as a matter which, assuming the charge against the accused to be true, constitutes a defense to it; an 'affirmative defense' does not directly challenge any element of the offense.""  commonwealth v. farley,, 861 (2005), quoting from 21 am. jur. 2d criminal law § 217 (1998).  such a defense ""involves a matter of justification particularly within the knowledge of the defendant on which he can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.""  farley, supra, quoting from model penal code § 1.12(3)(c) (1985).  pursuant to g. l. c. 278, § 7, ""[a] defendant in a criminal prosecution, relying for his justification upon a license, . . . or authority, shall prove the same; and, until so proved, the presumption shall be that he is not so authorized.""the cases citing g. l. c. 278, § 7, give us some guidance.  see, for example, jones, supra (""we sum up the established interpretation of g. l. c. 278, § 7, as it applies to prosecutions under g. l. c. 269, § 10[a].  the holding of a valid license brings the defendant within an exception to the general prohibition against carrying a firearm, and is an affirmative defense.  absence of a license is not 'an element of the crime,' as that phrase is commonly used.  in the absence of evidence with respect to a license, no issue ispage 721presented with respect to licensing.  in other words, the burden is on the defendant to come forward with evidence of the defense.  if such evidence is presented, however, the burden is on the prosecution to persuade the trier of facts beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense does not exist"") (citation omitted).the courts consistently have followed that analysis in the cases involving possession of a firearm.  in commonwealth v. humphries,, 767 (2013), the court reiterated:  ""[a] defendant charged with a possessory firearms offense can raise the defendant's own license as a defense.  see commonwealth v. gouse,, 802-803 (2012) . . . , and cases cited.  such a defendant must, prior to trial, provide notice of intent to raise the defense of license, see mass. r. crim. p. 14(b)(3), and must produce 'some evidence' of license at trial before the burden shifts to the commonwealth to prove the absence of the defendant's license beyond a reasonable doubt.""  see commonwealth v. indrisano,, 712 (2015).the courts have employed the same analysis in other contexts.  in commonwealth v. jefferson,, 718 (1979), the court said that ""[t]he same principles apply to a prosecution under g. l. c. 94c, § 27[, which made unlawful possession of hypodermic needles or syringes, with certain exceptions].  the 'authority' which the defendant must show extends beyond a license or other governmentally issued permission.  it includes, for example, the 'authority' to possess a hypodermic needle which may arise from the defendant's status as a student in a school described in the statute or which may arise because the defendant is a patient who has a written prescription from a physician.  placing on the commonwealth the burden of disproving each of the numerous exemptions under g. l. c. 94c, § 27, would make successful prosecutions under the statute virtually impossible.""  in commonwealth v. o'connell,, 664-665 (2003) (citation and footnote omitted), the court held that ""authority [to sign checks on behalf of an authorized signator] may be raised as a defense, and, if so raised, the commonwealth then bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the absence of authority.  see g. l. c. 278, § 7.  to raise the defense of acting under authority, the defendant must so notify the prosecutor and file a copy of the claim with the clerk of the court where the case is pending.  mass. r. crim. p. 14(b)(3) . . . .  failure to do so renders the claim of authority unavailable as a defense.""  see commonwealth v. dzewiacin, 252 mass. 126, 130-131 (1925) (wherepage 722a defendant is charged with transporting intoxicating liquors, ""g. l. c. 278, § 7, provides that a defendant in a criminal prosecution who relies for his justification upon a license, appointment or authority, shall prove the same, and until so proved, the presumption is that he is not so authorized"").by contrast, the supreme judicial court explicitly has distinguished the cases involving records from the registry of motor vehicles from application of g. l. c. 278, § 7.  see commonwealth v. munoz,, 507 (1981) (""the commonwealth, in urging us to apply g. l. c. 278, § 7, to this case and to require the defendant to bear the burden of producing evidence showing insurance, points to the relative ease with which the defendant could produce a document proving insurance if the car were in fact insured as compared with the difficulty the commonwealth has in proving noninsurance.  the commonwealth acknowledges, however, that under g. l. c. 90, § 34i, the registrar of motor vehicles is obliged to maintain information as to insurance on every car registered in the commonwealth and is required to make this information available to any person on request.  even assuming that it may be difficult for the commonwealth to prove noninsurance, this obstacle does not warrant the application of c. 278, § 7, in view of the fact that noninsurance is an element, in fact, the central element of a prosecution under g. l. c. 90, § 34j.  accordingly, we conclude that g. l. c. 278, § 7, is inapplicable to prosecutions under g. l. c. 90, § 34j"").we are persuaded that removing fire protection devices, with all of the safety concerns that activity presents, is more like those cases (possession of a firearm or ammunition, possession of a hypodermic needle, signing another's name to a check, or transportation of alcohol during prohibition) that prohibit the behavior absent an affirmative showing from the defendant that his or her actions were authorized.  the facts of this case, concerning a three-story rooming house with seven unrelated tenants occupying one side of a two-family house and a family occupying the other side, highlight the importance of the necessary fire protection devices and the safety interests protected by the statute.both humphries and o'connell highlight another flaw in the defendant's argument.  in order to raise a defense of authority, rule 14(b)(3) of the massachusetts rules of criminal procedure, as appearing in  442 mass. 1525  (2004), requires a defendant to provide pretrial notice that he or she intends to rely on a defense of authority or license.  here, the defendant offered no such notice and, instead, testified that he hadpage 723nothing to do with the removal of the smoke detectors.  as a result, a defense of authority was unavailable to him.  cf. commonwealth v. jefferson,, 832 (2012).conclusion.  in sum, reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, rational jurors were entitled to find that the defendant committed the charged offense.  see torres, 468 mass. at 292.  we see no error in the denial of the defendant's motion for a

[726-728]","after a probation violation hearing, the defendant was found in violation of his probation and had his probation term extended by six months.  the defendant now asserts, inter alia, that the judge's failure to specify, in writing, the grounds for his decision that the defendant was in violation of his probation was a due process violation.because we conclude that the judge's incomplete written findings at the time of the violation hearing, coupled with his oral findings issued at the hearing, satisfied the defendant's due process rights, we affirm.the defendant was found to be in violation of his probation for violating a special condition of his probation, which required that he stay away from the victim.  the facts of the violation itself arepage 725not of consequence to the appeal.the defendant now argues that the judge violated his right to due process by failing to issue written findings.further, he contends that he received inadequate written notice of his alleged probation violation and of purported additional probation violations, and that the probation officer improperly testified at his violation hearing without being placed under oath or subjected to cross-examination.the commonwealth and the defendant each produced one witness at the probation violation hearing, and both witnesses' testimony arguably supported a finding that the defendant had violated the order to stay away from the victim.  at the conclusion of the hearing, after the defendant's attorney argued that he should not be found in violation, the judge specifically stated, ""well [the defendant is] definitely in violation; even by the terms of [his] own witness.""  on the defendant's probation violation finding and disposition form, the judge checked off ""violation of probation found"" for the defendant's failure to comply with his order of probation, specifically, for violating the stay-away order.  on the same form,page 726the judge indicated that this finding was based on ""a hearing and the preponderance of the credible evidence, specifically, the following testimonial or documentary evidence.""  that section of the form is followed by a blank line, to be filled in by the judge with specific evidence relied on to support the violation finding.  in this instance, it was left blank.as the defendant's contentions implicate constitutional rights, we review to determine whether there was error and, if so, whether it was ""harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.""  commonwealth v. bacigalupo,, 495 (2009), citing commonwealth v. vinnie,, 163 (1998).  see commonwealth v. kelsey,, 319 (2013) (""courts in the commonwealth have assumed, without so holding, that the same standard [as exists in the trial context] applies to probation revocation hearings"").as a threshold matter, we note that ""[w]e may affirm . . . on any grounds supported by the record.""  commonwealth v. bartlett,, 117 (2013).  due process requires a judge to issue a written statement supporting a probation revocation to help ""insure accurate factfinding with respect to any alleged violation and"" (emphasis added).  black v. romano, 471 u.s. 606, 613-614 (1985).  probation violation hearings do not, however, carry the ""full panoply of constitutional protections applicable at a criminal trial.""  commonwealth v. bukin,, 520 (2014) (quotation omitted).  ""although a separate written statement of the evidence relied on and the reasons for revocation is one of the probationer's due process rights in such proceedings, it is not an inflexible or invariably mandatory requirement and can be satisfied in other ways.""  commonwealth v. morse,, 592-593 (2000).  transcribed oral findings can satisfy or supplement the judge's requirement to issue written findings.  see fay v. commonwealth,, 504-505 (1980).  like morse, supra at 593, ""this was a simple, straightforward case, and the entirety of the short transcript . . . is [the] inculpatory evidence.""  therefore, in this case, the judge's statement that the defendant was in violation ""even by the terms of [his] own witness,""coupled with the, albeitpage 727incomplete, probation violation finding and disposition form, satisfied the defendant's due process rights and afforded him an adequate basis for review.see fay, supra; morse, supra.the defendant's assertions regarding his written notice and the probation officer's role in the violation hearing are similarly unavailing.for the first time, the defendant now contends that because his notice of probation violation failed to state the date of the alleged incident, it failed to satisfy the written notice requirement set forth by rule 4(c) of the district/municipal courts rules for probation violation proceedings (2015).  see commonwealth v. durling,, 112-113 (1990).  even if the defendant's failure to raise this issue before the judge does not render the argument waived, see morse, supra at 589-590, it requires little discussion.  the notice requirement assures that the defendant has been adequately notified of the nature of the charges against him.  see fay, supra at 503.  there was ample evidence that the defendant was aware of the alleged violation against him, as the defendant came prepared and in fact presented a witness to testify to the incident in question.  additionally, the defendant did not move for a continuance or a bill of particulars, as would have been appropriate were he truly unaware of the basis for hispage 728alleged violation.order revoking probation affirmed.",criminal,Matthew J.

[737-739]","in 2015, winter storms caused significant damage to a dock in falmouth (town) owned by joanne delapa, as trustee of the delcor realty trust (delcor).  delcor sought approval from the town conservation commission (commission) to repair the dock, which would involve, inter alia, driving four pilings into a protected wetlands area.  acting in part pursuant to the town wetlands protection by-law and accompanying regulations, the commission denied delcor's application after finding it deficient in various respects.  delcor brought an action in the nature of certiorari to challenge the commission's denial, see g. l. c. 249, § 4, and on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings, see mass.r.civ.p. 12(c),  365 mass. 754  (1974), a superior court judge ruled in the commission's favor.  on delcor's appeal, we affirm the judgment.background.  1.  the construction of the dock.  delcor acquired the property in june of 1984,and some of the relevant facts predate delcor's ownership.  in july of 1983, a prior owner had obtained approval from the commission to build a dock and associated ramp and float (collectively, the dock).  that approval, known as an order of conditions, was issued pursuant to the wetlands protection act, g. l. c. 131, § 40 (act), and to a version of the town's wetlands protection by-law then in effect.the 1983 order of conditions set forth the specifications that the dock was required to meet, and it stated that the work authorized ""shall be completed within three years from the date of"" its issuance.the order of conditions also stated that it ""will not be fully complied with unless and until a duly executed [c]ertificate of [c]ompliance is recorded or registered, as appropriate, in barnstable [r]egistry of [d]eeds, certifying full compliance.""delcor or the prior owner also sought certain other approvals for the dock.  in a letter dated september 25, 1986 (that is, after the 1983 order of conditions expired), the army corps of engineerspage 731(the corps) indicated its approval of the dock pursuant to what is known as a ""general permit.""  that letter included underscored language that ""[w]ork may not begin until [the owner has] returned [an enclosed] form and obtained all other required federal, state and local authorizations.""on may 5, 1987, delcor applied to the town building inspector for a building permit to construct the dock.  that approval was denied.  the building commissioner then wrote a letter to delcor dated march 1, 1988, in which the inspector noted that an official from the commission had noticed that the dock had been built and stated that removal of the unauthorized structure was required.  this paper trail strongly suggests that the dock was built at some unspecified time between may of 1987 (when approval to construct the dock was requested from the building inspector) and march of 1988 (the first documentation that the dock had been built).  consistent with this timeline, but adding little detail, delcor subsequently filed with the commission a letter that described the dock as having been built in the ""late 1980s,"" and at a july 13, 2016, hearing before the commission, a contractor for delcor referenced it as having been built ""30 years ago.""  a commission staffer stated at that same hearing that the dock was built in march of 1988, although she did not indicate the basis for such a claim.  at another hearing, delcor's attorney at one point stated that construction of the dock began in september of 1986, and at another point stated that ""we don't know when the dock was built.""  in any event, following the 1988 letter from the building commissioner, the dock apparently was not removed, and the record is silent about any interactions between delcor and town officials for the next twenty-seven years.2.  the proposed repair of the dock.  in 2015, winter storms seriously damaged the dock.  as one local official described it, the end of the dock was ""mangled,"" and it is uncontested that part of the dock had sunk.  the town conservation agent informed a representative of delcor that in order to obtain approval to reconstruct the dock, delcor first would have to close out the 1983 order of conditions by pursuing a certificate of compliance confirming that the dock had been constructed in accordance with the 1983 order.  on march 18, 2016, delcor formally requested the commission to issue a certificate of compliance,and on june 17, 2016, delcor additionally sought approval to repair the dock by filing what is known as a notice of intent.  specifically, delcor sought approval to reconstruct the dock bypage 732driving four new pilings to replace damaged ones and by making certain repairs to other pilings that would remain.  delcor also sought to put back in place the float it had been using, which measured eighteen feet by eighteen feet.delcor's filings themselves documented various respects in which the dock, as built, did not conform to what had been approved in the 1983 order of conditions.  for example, the dock, as built, was 208 square feet larger than what had been approved.it is uncontested that delcor's application was unaccompanied by certain documentation identified in the local regulations as ""[s]ubmission [r]equirements for all [d]ocks.""  falmouth wetland regulations (fwr) § 10.16(1)(b).for example, delcor did not submit a shellfish survey or accurate depictions of water depths in the vicinity of the dock.  see fwr § 10.16(1)(b)(3),(6).  it appears to be delcor's position that such documentation is not required for an application to repair an existing dock, at least one allegedly constructed in substantial compliance with an earlier order of conditions.  at one of the hearings before the commission, one of delcor's representatives argued that many docks during the 1980s and the 1990s were constructed after wetlands approval to build them had expired and that the dock had been constructed in ""substantial"" compliance with the 1983 order of conditions.  on this basis, he urged the commission to grant approval as a dock repair.3.  the commission's order.  at a meeting held on august 24, 2016, the commission unanimously voted to deny delcor's application to repair the dock, and a formal written order denying such approval followed a week later.  in its transmittal letter, the commission stated that its denial was ""without prejudice,"" and in the order itself, the commission encouraged delcor to investigate whether a dock could be constructed in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and, if so, to reapply.  the order included various factual findings that the commission had madepage 733(discussed further below).  in the section that followed, labeled ""decision,"" the commission stated only that it was denying delcor's request for a permit.  nevertheless, among its enumerated factual findings, the commission also stated that it ""is requiring"" certain affirmative relief, namely, ""the immediate removal of all portions of the dock.""4.  the judge's ruling.  the commission issued its august 31, 2016, order in part pursuant to the local wetlands protection by-law and regulations, and delcor brought the current action to appeal those aspects of the order.on an uncontested administrative record assembled by the commission, a superior court judge ruled in the commission's favor on cross motions for judgment on the pleadings.  the judge did not issue a written memorandum of decision but made the following statements from the bench:""i [am] affirming the decision of the . . . [commission].  it [is] based on substantial[] evidence.  it [is] not arbitrary or capricious.  i [have] reviewed the record.  i [have] reviewed all the supporting information.""discussion.  1.  standard of review.  ""we review de novo [a] judge's order allowing a motion for judgment on the pleadings under [mass.r.civ.p. 12(c),  365 mass. 754  (1974)].""  commonwealth v. fremont inv. & loan,, 212 (2011), quoting from wheatley v. massachusetts insurers insolvency fund,, 600 (2010), s.c.,(2013).  in an action in the nature of certiorari challenging a wetlands permit decision made by a conservation commission pursuant to a local by-law, our review is limited at most to whether the commission's decision is supported by substantial evidence in the administrativepage 734record, whether the commission's action was arbitrary and capricious, and whether the commission committed an abuse of discretion or other error of law.  see generally fafard v. conservation commn. of reading,, 567-568 (1996) (discussing standards of review applicable to conservation commission permitting decisions).  see also lovequist v. conservation commn. of dennis,, 17 (1979); tdj dev. corp. v. conservation commn. of n. andover,, 128 (1994).2.  regulatory framework.  we begin our analysis by reviewing the framework established by the fwr.  those regulations were promulgated by the commission in 1998, and therefore, they were not in place when the dock originally was built.  under the regulations, a permit application is required whenever someone proposes to do work that ""will [r]emove, [f]ill, dredge, build upon, degrade, or otherwise [a]lter an [a]rea subject to protection under [the wetlands protection by-law].""  fwr § 10.02(2)(a).  the term ""alter"" expressly is defined to include the ""[d]riving of piles.""  fwr § 10.04.there is a specific section of the regulations that applies to coastal docks.fwr § 10.16(1).  notably, those regulations do not include a specific grandfathering provision, as such, that excluded existing docks from their application.however, some of the specified performance standards apply principally to ""new"" docks, and apply to ""existing"" docks in a more limited fashion.  for example, the regulations state that ""[n]o new docks or piers or extension of an existing dock or pier may be constructed in any portion of [federal emergency management agency] designated velocity zone (v-zone) unless the applicant demonstrates that there will be a public benefit from the project.""  fwr § 10.16(1)(h)(1).  as an additional example, there is a prohibitionpage 735on a dock being located within ""[fifty] feet of an area of eel grass"" that applies to a ""new [dock], replacement, or substantial alteration of an existing dock.""  fwr § 10.16(1)(h)(5).  the regulations do not define what constitutes a ""new"" dock or an ""existing"" dock.at least on their face, many of the regulatory standards apply without regard to whether a dock is considered ""new"" or ""existing.""  for example, fwr § 10.16(1)(b) sets forth ""[s]ubmission [r]equirements for [a]ll [d]ocks,"" including requirements that applications include -- among many other items -- a shellfish survey and water depth measurements.  additionally, the section governing design specifications and performance standards for docks in recreational harbors includes a strict requirement that dock floats ""shall not exceed 100 square feet.""fwr § 10.16(1)(d)(3).  in an indirect way, the regulations address the extent to which approval is required for the maintenance and repair of those docks that previously had been approved under the regulations.  specifically, the following language is required as a ""special condition"" in dock approvals issued under the regulations:

""normal maintenance and repair of a dock or pier is allowed.  no extension, alteration or change from the plan of reference is permitted without first obtaining a modification to this permit in accordance with . . . [c]ommission procedures.""fwr § 10.16(1)(i)(8).3.  the denial of delcor's permit application.  delcor argues that the commission's denying the proposed reconstruction of the dock as it had been before the storms damaged it is unsupported by substantial evidence and constitutes an abuse of discretion.  that argument gains no traction from the language of the dock regulations discussed above.  as noted, those regulations include no grandfathering provision as such.  even though the dock was built before the regulations were adopted, delcor's proposal falls within the regulations' purview, because delcor has proposed new activity in the wetlands areas protected by the by-law -- the driving of piles -- that under the terms of the regulations ""alter""page 736those areas by definition.  regardless of whether delcor's proposal were considered one for a new dock or for the repair of an existing dock, the commission's conclusion that delcor's application was procedurally and substantively deficient is well supported by the record.indeed, it is difficult to conceive of how the commission could have approved the proposal where the application both did not comply with mandatory submission requirements and included substantive elements that appear to be at odds with the current performance standards (e.g., the proposed return of a float that has a square footage that is over three times larger than what apparently now is permitted).delcor's argument that the commission erred is based not so much on the language of the dock regulations as on a gloss that it alleges the commission has applied to them.  specifically, delcor maintains that the commission has a policy of summarily approving repairs of existing docks so long as the original construction of the dock was approved and its historic footprint is not expanded.  delcor further argues that its proposal qualifies for such approval because the dock was constructed in substantial compliance with the 1983 order of conditions.to be sure, the commission did put a great deal of focus during the application process on the extent to which the dock was constructed in compliance with the 1983 order of conditions.  this lends some credence to delcor's suggestion that the commission might have considered its proposal acceptable had it demonstrated compliance with that approval.  however, putting aside whether such a gloss can be squared with the actual language of the regulations -- a question we do not reach -- delcor's argument fails on its own terms.  there is substantial support in the record for the commission's conclusion that the dock was not built prior to the expiration of the 1983 order of conditions.  moreover, in any event, the record reveals that the dock, as built, deviated from what was allowed in the 1983 order of conditions in ways that the commission could find significant.therefore, even were we to assume that the commission were bound by apage 737policy that summary approval should be granted for the repair of existing approved docks, delcor has not demonstrated that the commission abused its discretion in declining to extend such a policy to delcor.we emphasize that our ruling does not depend on whether the dock is considered a new dock or an existing dock, an issue that ultimately may need to be resolved in order to determine which of the various performance standards apply.  the record reveals little consideration of that issue to date by either side, and we leave resolution of it until another day.4.  affirmative relief.  one issue remains.  as noted, the commission's order not only denied delcor the requested approval, but also noted that the commission ""is requiring the immediate removal"" of all of the dock.  delcor argues that the commission's requiring it to take such affirmative action to remedy an alleged past or ongoing violation amounted to ""a misuse of the wetlands regulatory process for enforcement purposes.""  the proper procedure, according to delcor, would have been to issue an enforcement order.  delcor additionally argues that such an order would be time barred by the statute of limitations set forth at g. l. c. 260, § 2b, or by the doctrine of laches.for two reasons, we conclude that we need not reach delcor's arguments that the portion of the commission's decision addressing affirmative relief was procedurally defective and time barred.  first, our review of the record reveals that delcor never raisedpage 738such issues in superior court.see jancey v. school comm. of everett,, 500 (1995) (appellant cannot raise nonjurisdictional argument for first time on appeal), s.c.,(1998).  second, we conclude that the commission's markedly casual reference to affirmative relief does not rise to the level of an enforcement order, that is, an administrative order that has independent force of law.  cf. director of the div. of water pollution control v. uxbridge,, 592-593 (1972) (in action to enforce unappealed administrative enforcement order, only issue is whether administrative action was within agency's jurisdiction).  notably, the commission embedded its statement regarding affirmative relief as a factual finding in what otherwise is merely a ruling in a permitting proceeding.  our conclusion that the commission did not issue a formal enforcement order is reinforced by the fact that the commission did not spell out the legal basis for such an order, an absence that is particularly pronounced to the extent that the commission is left to rely solely on delcor's noncompliance with local law.finally, the fact that the commission denied delcor's proposal without prejudice and expressly invited delcor to resubmit an application for the dock suggests that the commission did not intend to issue a final binding order to remove the dock.to be clear, nothing in this opinion should be read as our having concluded that the commission lacked the authority -- based solely on local law -- to require delcor to remove the rest of the dock in an appropriately instituted administrative or judicial enforcement proceeding.we simply reserve such issues to another day.judgment affirmed.",civil,None,affirm

[744]at a criminal trial, the judge, in excluding certain testimony that would require the jury to speculate on collateral issues, did not prevent the defendant from pursuing a third-party culprit defense, and no error or substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice arose from the judge's decision to exclude the prior criminal record of the alleged third-party culprit [744-746]; further, the judge did not deny the defendant the ability to present a defense regarding the failure of police to investigate. [746]at the trial of a criminal complaint charging the defendant with firearm offenses, the evidence was not sufficient to convict the defendant of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, where the defendant could not have discerned whether a handgun in the center console of the truck he was driving was loaded merely by looking at it, and the commonwealth presented no evidence that the defendant knew it was loaded; further, the evidence was insufficient to convict the defendant of possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card, where the only ammunition was found within the handgun itself. [746-748]","following a jury trial in the district court, the defendant, edward galarza, was convicted of various firearm related offenses.on appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress, (2) the trial judge denied him the opportunity to present certain defenses, and (3) the evidence was insufficient on the conviction of possession of a loaded firearm without a license.  we affirm in part and reverse in part.1.  background.  the jury could have found the following facts.  on september 15, 2015, at approximately 1:50 a.m., state police trooper matthew stone was on patrol in a marked sport utility vehicle on armory street in springfield, a high crime area.   stone saw a pickup truck traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.  as stone increased his speed to catch up with the pickup truck, the truck rapidly slowed down.  stone noticed that the rear registration plate lights were not working, and that the driver's side mirror was cracked.  after stopping the pickup truck, stone approached it and saw the operator, later identified as the defendant, bend forward slightly and move to his right.  as the defendant bent forward, stone could no longer see his head and torso.  when stone reached the driver's side window, the defendant was speaking on a cellular telephone (cell phone) ""very urgently, very nervously.""  the defendant asked the person on the other end of the cell phone call to come to the location of the stop.  stone saw that the defendant was ""very nervous,"" ""panicked,"" and ""breathing very heavily.""stone asked the defendant to end the call; the defendant refused; stone again asked the defendant to end the call.  this time, without ending the call, the defendant turned toward stone and told him that the party on the other end of the cell phone call owned the pickup truck.  stone asked the defendant for his driver's license and the pickup truck's registration.  the defendant produced only his license, telling stone that the registration was not in the truck.  when asked how he knew that, the defendant answered that ""he just knew.""  over the speaker on the cell phone, stone heard the voice of a third party tell the defendant two or three times that the registration was in the center console.  when stonepage 742asked the defendant about this, he responded by opening the glove box and quickly closing it.  he said, ""[s]ee, it's not in there.""  stone responded that the third party said the registration was in the center console, not the glove box.  the defendant placed his arm over the center console and refused to open it, in an effort to block access to it.the defendant became extremely nervous and began to look around.  stone was concerned that the defendant would either try to flee or fight; stone was also concerned for his safety.  as a result, stone ordered the defendant not to move.  at the same time, a springfield police officer drove by and stone signaled that he needed assistance.  additional springfield police officers soon arrived on the scene.  stone ordered the defendant to get out of the pickup truck.  although not yet under arrest, the defendant was handcuffed.  meanwhile, stone returned to the pickup truck and opened the center console, where he observed a handgun.  stone asked the defendant to produce a ""license to carry,"" and the defendant responded that he did not have one.  the defendant was then arrested and given miranda warnings.  the gun was loaded with one round of ammunition in the chamber and seven rounds of ammunition in the magazine.stone called for a tow truck.while the pickup truck was being prepared to be towed, an individual arrived, later identified as albin medina, who said he was its owner.  stone recognized medina's voice as the same one that he heard on the cell phone speaker; medina confirmed that, in fact, it was. stone verified that medina owned the pickup truck and had a driver's license.  stone asked him if there was anything in the pickup truck that stone needed to be aware of; medina said no.  stone then released the pickup truck to him.2.  motion to suppress.a.  exit order.  the defendant contends that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress because the exit order, patfrisk,and search of the pickup truck's center console amounted to an unreasonable warrantless search.  ""in reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept thepage 743[motion] judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error but conduct an independent review of [the] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.""  commonwealth v. cawthron,, 616 (2018) (quotation omitted).  ""we review independently the application of constitutional principles to the facts found.""  commonwealth v. amado,, 151 (2016) (quotation omitted).here, the pickup truck was stopped for speeding.  police officers are warranted in stopping a motor vehicle for traffic violations.  see generally commonwealth v. buckley,, 865-866 (2018).  the defendant does not challenge the legality of the stop.  instead, he contends that stone did not have reasonable suspicion to order the defendant to get out of the pickup truck.  an exit order is warranted in three situations: (1) ""when a reasonably prudent [person] in the policeman's position would be warranted in the belief that the safety of the police or that of other persons was in danger""; (2) ""if the officer developed a reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts that the [subject of the exit order] was engaged in, or about to engage in, criminal activity""; and (3) ""where the police were conducting a search of the automobile on other grounds.""  amado, 474 mass. at 152 (quotations omitted).  ""the police are not required to gamble with their personal safety . . . and are entitled to take reasonable precautions for their protection.""  commonwealth v. cabrera,, 350 (2010) (quotations omitted).  the defendant parses the facts to suggest that, viewed independently, the defendant's nervousness, his ducking down, and the high crime area where the stop occurred were not enough.  however, these facts must be viewed in the totality of the circumstances.  see commonwealth v. stampley,, 325-326 (2002).  viewing the evidence through the lens of an experienced, trained trooper, as the motion judge did, the exit order was proper.  the motion judge articulated a multitude of factors that justify the exit order.  as stone approached the pickup truck, the defendant ducked down; he ignored stone's command to end the cell phone call multiple times; he appeared nervous and frantic; he refused to open the center console despite information that the pickup truck registration was contained in it; he put his hand over the center console; the pickup truck was stopped in a high crime area at 1:50 a.m.; and he had a single key, without a ring on it, which in stone's opinion was consistent with theft of a motor vehicle.  this constellation of facts justify the exit order because of an objectively reasonablepage 744concern for officer safety.b.  the handcuffing.  the defendant's argument that he was arrested when the police placed him in handcuffs fares no better.  the defendant's brief detention prior to the discovery of the firearm did not rise to the level of a formal arrest.  see commonwealth v. sinforoso,, 325 (2001).  the use of handcuffs is not dispositive on the question whether and when a stop has been transformed into an arrest.  see commonwealth v. dyette,, 556-557 (2015).  indeed, at that point in time the police had reasonable suspicion, but not yet probable cause, to believe a crime had been committed.  moreover, concern for officer safety also permits the defendant to be handcuffed.  see commonwealth v. williams,, 117-118 (1996).c.  search of the center console.  police may conduct a protective sweep of the interior of a motor vehicle for a weapon so long as the search is limited to areas from where the defendant could access a weapon.  see commonwealth v. manha,, 49 (2018).  allowing the defendant to return to the pickup truck without a search for weapons, where a weapon could be within reach of the defendant, poses an obvious concern for officer safety.  see commonwealth v. edwards,, 348-349 (2017) (""although the defendant was not in the vehicle at the time the gun was observed, . . . there was no assurance that he would not be returning promptly to his seat behind the wheel of the automobile"").  the defendant's refusal to open the console and his placing his hand over the compartment in a way that prevented access to it justified the search.  the motion was properly denied.3.  defenses.  the defendant next argues that it was error for the trial judge to prevent him from presenting evidence of a third-party culprit and that the police investigation was inadequate.  we disagree.a.  third-party culprit.  a defendant is given wide latitude to present evidence that someone other than himself committed the crime; however, that latitude is not boundless.  see commonwealth v. silva-santiago,, 800-801 (2009); mass. g. evid. § 1105 (2018).  a judge is permitted broad discretion in deciding whether to exclude third-party culprit evidence.  see silva-santiago, 453 mass. at 801.on the morning of trial, the defendant indicated his intention to call his prior attorney, peter slepchuk, as a witness.  during a voir dire, slepchuk testified that he represented the defendant atpage 745arraignment, and that during the bail review, he argued that the firearm belonged to the owner of the pickup truck, medina.  he testified that he had learned that medina had prior firearm convictions and used this information to support his argument.  slepchuk further testified that approximately one week later, as he was entering the court house for the defendant's bail review hearing, a man who identified himself as medina approached him.  this person told slepchuk that he was aware of slepchuk's bail argument.  he ordered slepchuk not to implicate medina or use his name again.  slepchuk testified that this man told him that the defendant needed to take responsibility; the man then followed him into the court room for the bail review hearing.  at sidebar, slepchuk notified the bail judge and the prosecutor of what occurred; he eventually reported it to the state police.  thereafter, slepchuk filed a motion to withdraw on the basis that he had become a potential witness.  the motion was allowed.the commonwealth objected to slepchuk's proposed testimony, contending that it was largely hearsay and not relevant to the crimes charged.  the defendant claimed it was both relevant and necessary for a bowden defense.  see commonwealth v. bowden,, 485-486 (1980); mass. g. evid. § 1107 (2018).  the proffered testimony, however, would require the jury to speculate on collateral issues.  see commonwealth v. phinney,, 163 (2006).  specifically, the jury would have to surmise that the person who approached slepchuk was in fact medina, that the firearm belonged to medina, and that medina wanted the defendant to take responsibility for the firearm.  in considering the proposed evidence, the trial judge properly excluded slepchuk's testimony, as some of the proposed testimony was hearsay and the balance was not relevant to whether the defendant possessed the firearm at the time it was recovered. see commonwealth v. rosario,, 556-557 (2005) (judge permitted to exclude third-party culprit evidence on relevancy grounds).  this ruling did not, however, foreclose the defendant from pursing a third-party culprit defense.  the defendant was permitted to testify that he was not the owner of the pickup truck, this was the first time he had borrowed it, he had no knowledge of the items in the pickup truck, and the firearm did not belong to him.  there was no error.next, the defendant argues that it was error to exclude medina's prior criminal record.  third-party culprit evidence that is hearsay and does not fall within an exception is admissible if, ""inpage 746the judge's discretion, the evidence is otherwise relevant, will not tend to prejudice or confuse the jury, and there are other substantial connecting links to the crime.""  silva-santiago, 453 mass. at 801 (quotation omitted).  for the same reasons detailed in the discussion concerning slepchuk's proffered testimony, there was no error in excluding these records.for the first time on appeal, the defendant argues that the excluded evidence was indicative of medina's consciousness of guilt.  as this was not raised in the trial court, we consider whether the ruling, if error, gave rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. vuthy seng,, 550, cert. denied, 537 u.s. 942 (2002).  we conclude that it does not for substantially the same reasons that slepchuk's testimony was properly excluded.  this evidence would require the jury to speculate that the person who approached slepchuk was in fact medina, and that the gun belonged to him.  see rosario, 444 mass. at 557.  there was no error, let alone a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.b.  failure to investigate.  based on the voir dire testimony of slepchuk, the defendant sought to advance a defense that the police investigation was inadequate.  see bowden, 379 mass. at 485-486.  the defendant's claim that he was denied the ability to present a failure to investigate defense is belied by the record.  he was permitted to question stone about his conversation with medina when he arrived at the scene of the stop.stone was also questioned about the lack of fingerprint evidence and deoxyribonucleic acid testing.  as a result of this line of questioning, the judge gave the jury a bowden instruction.  there was no error.4.  sufficiency of the evidence.  in his opening brief, the defendant raised three categories of purported errors:  (1) the denial of his motion to suppress, (2) rulings on certain aspects of his defenses, and (3) the sufficiency of the evidence of the conviction on the charge of carrying a loaded firearm.  in its brief, the commonwealth noted that the defendant did not raise the sufficiency of the evidence of the convictions on the charges of carrying a firearm without a license and possession of ammunition and asserted that these issues are waived.  see mass.r.a.p. 16(a)(4), as amended,page 747367 mass. 921  (1975).  in the defendant's reply brief, he addressed the commonwealth's response to the three claims he had raised in his opening brief with specific reference to pages in the commonwealth's brief.  like his opening brief, the defendant's reply brief was silent on the sufficiency of the evidence on the charges of carrying a firearm without a license and possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card.  thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental brief, a supporting affidavit, and the proposed supplemental brief.  there, for the first time, the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conviction of possession of ammunition.  he further argued that this conviction is duplicative of the conviction of possession of a loaded firearm.  defense counsel's supporting affidavit stated that he became aware that he had omitted these two issues after reviewing the commonwealth's brief, and that he had no strategic reason for doing so.  the commonwealth filed an opposition arguing that the issues were waived, and pointing out that both the defendant's opening brief and his reply brief failed to address these issues.rule 16(c) of the massachusetts rules of appellate procedure, as amended,  399 mass. 1217  (1987), upon which the defendant relies in support of his motion for leave to file a supplemental brief, provides in pertinent part that an ""appellant may file a brief in reply to the brief of the appellee.""  the defendant did so and made substantive arguments in response to the commonwealth's brief.  although the commonwealth highlighted the issue of waiver in its brief, the defendant's reply brief failed to address it.  to allow the defendant to file a supplemental brief on an issue that is not new, and does not address a change in the law, would eviscerate the doctrine of waiver.  accordingly, the defendant's motion for leave to file a supplemental brief is denied.  however, we address the question of sufficiency of the evidence for purposes of assessing whether there has been a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. powell,, 579 (2011), cert. denied, 565 u.s. 1262 (2012), quoting from commonwealth v. grandison,, 140 n.8 (2001).  (although raised for first time on appeal, we consider claim ""because 'findings based on legally insufficient evidence are inherently serious enough to create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice'"").here, we have the rare case that presents both a procedural defect and a sufficiency issue that compels reversal on thepage 748question of sufficiency of the evidenceof the conviction of possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card.  in addition, the defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew the firearm was loaded and therefore the conviction of possession of a loaded firearm must be reversed.""to convict the defendant of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, the commonwealth [is] required to prove that the defendant knowingly possessed a firearm that was loaded with ammunition and met the legal requirements of a firearm . . . .""  commonwealth v. johnson,, 52 (2011).  in a recent decision, the supreme judicial court held that ""to sustain a conviction [of possession of a loaded firearm], the commonwealth must prove that a defendant knew the firearm he possessed was loaded.""  commonwealth v. brown,, 601 (2018).here, as in brown, the ammunition in the firearm was the only evidence presented that the firearm was loaded.  it therefore follows that because ""the defendant 'could not have discerned whether the gun was loaded merely by looking at it,' and the commonwealth presented no evidence that the defendant knew it was loaded,"" the evidence was insufficient.  id. at 605, quoting from commonwealth v. brown,, 293 (2017).possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card is a lesser included offense of unlawful possession of a loaded firearm.  see johnson, 461 mass. at 54.  and, because the only ammunition in this case was found within the firearm itself, this conviction too cannot stand.5.  conclusion.  the conviction of possession of a firearm without a license is affirmed.  the convictions of possession of a loaded firearm without a license and possession of ammunitionpage 749without a firearm identification card are set aside, and judgments shall enter for the defendant on those charges.so ordered.",criminal,Patricia T.

1700,phillip cucchi & anothervs.  city of newton & others.,"civil service, decision of civil service commission, judicial review, promotion, fire fighters.  fire fighter.  declaratory relief.this court concluded that a person seeking judicial review of a civil service commission (commission) decision under g. l. c. 31, § 44, was required to file a petition seeking such review within thirty days of receipt of the commission's decision, that the filing of a motion to reconsider a commission decision does not toll the time for seeking judicial review of that decision, and that references in § 44 to g. l. c. 30a, § 14, did not affect that requirement. [752-756]this court remanded for further proceedings a claim in a civil action for declaratory relief regarding the interpretation by the civil service commission (commission) of a rule regarding the promotion of a fire fighter to captain, where the judge dismissed the claim without giving any reason for doing so, and where, on appeal, the parties did not fully address whether the plaintiffs' challenge to the commission's interpretation met all the requirements for declaratory relief. [756-757]","in curley v. lynn,, 41-42 (1990), the court held that a person seeking judicial review of a civil service commission (commission) decision under g. l. c. 31, § 44, as then in effect, was required to file a petition seeking such review within thirty days of receipt of the commission's decision, and that such time was not tolled by filing a request for reconsiderationpage 751with the commission.  section 44 was subsequently amended in 1992, primarily to shift jurisdiction to conduct judicial review to the superior court, but also to include a cross-reference to judicial review under g. l. c. 30a, § 14.  section 14(1) provides that the timely filing of a petition for rehearing with an agency tolls the time for seeking judicial review of the agency decision.the question we face here is whether § 44, as now in effect, continues to impose the strict thirty-day deadline for seeking review of commission decisions identified in curley, or instead whether its cross-reference to § 14 means that the time for seeking review is tolled by the timely filing of a petition for rehearing.  we conclude that § 44 continues to impose a strict thirty-day deadline and, thus, we affirm the portion of the judgment dismissing, as untimely, the plaintiffs' claim for judicial review.  as for the plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief, however, which was dismissed without explanation, we vacate that portion of the judgment and remand for further proceedings.background.  the complaint alleged that the plaintiffs, fire fighters for the city of newton (city), were on a list issued in 2014 by the human resources division (division) of persons eligible for promotion to the position of captain.  in march of 2016, shortly before the list was scheduled to expire and to be replaced by a new list, the city promoted another candidate, gregory gentile, to a captain position.  gentile was ranked higher than the plaintiffs on the expiring list, but lower than them on the new list.  the plaintiffs alleged that the city's use of the expiring list violated a division rule known as personnel administration rule (rule) 08 and that gentile's appointment reflected improper favoritism; they asked the commission to conduct an investigation under g. l. c. 31, § 2(a).the commission received submissions from the parties and held a show cause hearing.  on september 1, 2016, the commission issued a decisionconcluding, among other things, that the city had not violated rule 08, as the commission interpreted that rule, and ""that an investigation, beyond that already conducted here, is not warranted.""  on september 7, the plaintiffs filed apage 752motion for reconsideration.on october 13, the commission denied the motion.on november 10, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in superior court, seeking judicial review of the commission's september 1 decision (count i) and a declaratory judgment that the commission's interpretation of rule 08 was erroneous and adversely affected the plaintiffs' rights (count ii).on the defendants' motion, a judge ordered dismissal of the entire complaint.  the judge concluded that the claim for judicial review was untimely under g. l. c. 31, § 44, because it was filed more than thirty days after the plaintiffs received the commission decision and because the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider did not toll the running of that thirty-day period.  the judge did not separately discuss the claim for declaratory relief.  the plaintiffs appeal the resulting judgment of dismissal.discussion.  1.  claim for judicial review.  in 1990, when the supreme judicial court concluded in curley that a motion for reconsideration did not toll the thirty-day deadline of § 44, that section provided in pertinent part:""within thirty days after receiving notice of the decision of the commission following a hearing requested by him pursuant to section forty-two or section forty-three, a person may, if he is aggrieved by such decision, file a petition to review the commission's decision in the municipal court of the city of boston or in the district court for the judicial district wherein such person resides.""g. l. c. 31, § 44, inserted by st. 1978, c. 393, § 11.  see curley, 408 mass. at 40.page 753the legislature adopted new versions of § 44 in 1991and, more relevant here, in 1992.  the 1992 version, which remains in effect, provides in pertinent part:""any party aggrieved by a final order or decision of the commission following a hearing pursuant to any section of this chapter or chapter thirty-one a may institute proceedings for judicial review in the superior court within thirty days after receipt of such order or decision.  any proceedings in the superior court shall, insofar as applicable, be governed by the provisions of section fourteen of chapter thirty a, and may be instituted in the superior court for the county (a) where the parties or any of them reside or have their principal place of business within the commonwealth, or (b) where the commission has its principal place of business, or (c) of suffolk.  the commencement of such proceedings shall not, unless specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the commission's order or decision.""g. l. c. 31, § 44, as appearing in st. 1992, c. 133, § 351.the requirement for filing within thirty days after receipt of the commission decision remains essentially unchanged since the court decided curley.  unless some other language in the current § 44 has relaxed that requirement, the judge here correctly dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for judicial review.  ""with extremely rare exceptions not relevant here, failure to timely file is . . . typically an absolute bar to a plaintiff's ability to obtain judicial review of a final agency action.""  herrick v. essex regional retirement bd.,, 190 (2007).the plaintiffs argue that the thirty-day requirement is now modified by the reference in § 44 to proceedings in the superior court being governed by g. l. c. 30a, § 14, which the plaintiffs view as incorporating § 14 in its entirety into § 44.  it follows, the plaintiffs argue, that § 44 is subject to the provision in § 14(1)page 754that an action for judicial review""shall, except as otherwise provided by law, be commenced in the court within thirty days after receipt of notice of the final decision of the agency"" (emphasis added).g. l. c. 30a, § 14(1), as amended through st. 1998, c. 463, § 33.we see numerous difficulties with the plaintiffs' interpretation.  first, § 44 suggests that the only provisions of § 14 intended to apply with respect to the commission are those that concern court proceedings after, not before, an action for judicial review is filed.  in one sentence, § 44 states that an aggrieved party ""may institute proceedings for judicial review in the superior court within thirty days after receipt of [the commission's final] order or decision.""  this sentence governs when judicial proceedings must be instituted, and it contains no tolling provision and no reference to § 14.  the next sentence governs how such proceedings, if instituted, are to be conducted:  ""any proceedings in the superior court shall, insofar as applicable, be governed by [g. l. c. 30a, § 14,] . . . .""  this reference to § 14 is not naturally read as addressing matters (such as the filing of a motion to reconsider) that arise before any court proceedings are instituted.second, § 44 includes not one but three provisions that, although similar to the corresponding provisions in § 14, depart from them in material ways.  most obviously, the § 44 thirty-day time limit for seeking judicial review omits any tolling provision like the one in § 14.  in addition, § 44 is patterned on, yet differs from, § 14 on the issues of venueand stays of agency decisions.page 755if the plaintiffs were correct that § 44 was nevertheless intended to incorporate the entirety of § 14, then these three differing provisions of § 44 would be rendered superfluous.  this would violate a basic tenet of statutory construction:  ""wherever possible, we give meaning to each word in the legislation; no word in a statute should be considered superfluous.""  international org. of masters, mates & pilots, atl. & gulf maritime region, afl-cio v. woods hole, martha's vineyard & nantucket s.s. authy.,, 813 (1984).third, language in both statutes suggests that not all of § 14 applies to judicial review proceedings under § 44.  specifically, § 44 states that ""proceedings in the superior court shall,, be governed by [§ 14]"" (emphasis added).  and § 14, as appearing in st. 1973, c. 1114, § 3, states that ""[w]here a statutory form of judicial review or appeal is provided[,], except as to standards for review"" (emphasis added).furthermore, the language of § 14(1), as amended through st. 1998, c. 463, § 33, concerning the time limit for seeking judicial review applies ""except as otherwise provided by law.""  moreover, to whatever extent there may be a conflict between § 44 and § 14, it is § 44, as the later-adopted statute and the one more specific to the commission, that would control.see doe v. attorney gen. (no. 1),, 215 (1997).fourth and finally, shortly after the court held in curley that the time under § 44 for seeking judicial review of commission decisions was not tolled by filing a request for reconsideration with the commission, the legislature adopted two new versions of § 44, in 1991 and again in 1992.  see discussion, supra.  ""we presume that the legislature enacts legislation with 'an aware[ness] of the prior state of the law as explicated by the decisionspage 756of [the supreme judicial court].'""  commonwealth v. mogelinski,, 646 (2013), quoting from commonwealth v. callahan,, 441 (2003).  if the legislature had intended to alter prospectively the result reached in curley, we would expect the legislature to have done so in clear terms.  it would have been a simple matter to add specific tolling language to § 44, similar to the language in § 14(1) on which the plaintiffs now rely.  or, if the legislature had intended (as the plaintiffs argue) to make all of § 14 applicable to commission decisions, § 44 could have been amended simply to provide, without elaboration, that judicial review of commission decisions was to be governed by § 14.  the legislature did neither of these things.  instead, it settled upon a version of § 44 that adopted some language, but changed or rejected other language, from the corresponding provisions of § 14.the foregoing considerations, taken together, persuade us that the filing of a motion to reconsider a commission decision does not toll the time for seeking judicial review of that decision.we do not decide whether any of those considerations would be dispositive standing alone, nor do we decide any other question about the interpretation of § 44 or § 14.  we conclude only that the plaintiffs' claim for judicial review was correctly dismissed as untimely filed.2.  claim for declaratory relief.  the judge dismissed the plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief but gave no reason for doing so.  on appeal, the commission asks us to affirm that portion of the judgment on the ground that, as to its decision not to investigatepage 757further the city's march, 2016, promotion of gentile, there is no actual controversy and the plaintiffs lack standing.  see villages dev. co. v. secretary of the executive office of envtl. affairs,, 106 (1991) (""to secure declaratory relief in a case involving administrative action, a plaintiff must show that [1] there is an actual controversy; [2] he has standing; [3] necessary parties have been joined; and [4] available administrative remedies have been exhausted"").unlike the commission, we do not read the plaintiffs' claim for declaratory relief as focused exclusively on the promotion of gentile.  the plaintiffs also challenge the commission's interpretation of rule 08, a matter that the plaintiffs argue is significant to their own future promotional opportunities and to the obligations of the city (and many other municipalities).  a dispute about an agency's interpretation of a regulation may be an appropriate subject for declaratory relief if that interpretation is ""consistently repeated"" and applied and the other requirements for declaratory relief are met.  g. l. c. 231a, § 2, inserted by st. 1974, c. 630, § 1.  see frawley v. police commr. of cambridge,, 725 (2016); grady v. commissioner of correction,, 135-136 (2013).the parties have not fully addressed in this appeal whether the plaintiffs' challenge to the commission's interpretation of rule 08 meets all of the requirements for declaratory relief.  in these circumstances, we express no view on the question and instead remand the matter for further consideration in the superior court.conclusion.  so much of the judgment as dismissed the claim for declaratory relief (count ii) is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision.  the remainder of the judgment is affirmed.

(and a companion case).,"civil harassment.  harassment prevention.  practice, civil, findings by judge.discussion of g. l. c. 258e, providing for the issuance of a harassment prevention order, and the narrowing construction thereof requiring three predicate true threats intended to cause fear of physical harm that together in fact cause such fear. [758-761]this court concluded that the findings on which a district court judge based the issuance of a harassment prevention order required remand, where, even assuming that the acts that could have been seen in two video recordings (in which the defendant could have been blocking the plaintiffs exit from a store and could have been threatening the plaintiff with physical harm) constituted harassment so as to serve as two predicate acts, the judge made no finding whether a third incident occurred. [764-766]the issuance of a harassment prevention order by a district court judge required remand, where the judges order did not specify what the three predicate acts of harassment were. [766]","in this appeal from the issuance of two ""harassment prevention orders"" under g. l. c. 258e, we are faced once again with the consequences of the variance between the plain language of the statute and the narrowing construction given the statute in o'brien v. borowski,(2012) (o'brien).chapter 258e and its limiting construction.  as it reads in the statute books, g. l. c. 258e provides that a protective order shall issue based upon a finding of ""harassment.""  the statute definespage 759harassment to mean ""[three] or more acts of willful and malicious conduct aimed at a specific person,"" each of which must be ""characterized by cruelty, hostility or revenge"" and ""committed with the intent to cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property and that does in fact cause fear, intimidation, abuse or damage to property.""  g. l. c. 258e, § 1, inserted by st. 2010, c. 23.  (the statute also provides independently for issuance of an order based on acts that ""by force, threat or duress cause[] another to involuntarily engage in sexual relations,"" or that constitute violations of statutes prohibiting indecent assault and battery, rape, rape and abuse, assault with intent to commit rape, enticement, stalking, criminal harassment, and drugging persons for sexual intercourse.  g. l. c. 258e, § 1.  that provision is not at issue in this case.)the statute was passed to fill a gap left by g. l. c. 209a, which allows individuals to seek abuse prevention orders against family or household members.  violation of such an order is punishable as a crime.  however,""[a] person who is abused by someone other than a 'family or household member' does not qualify for a protective order under c. 209a and could obtain a restraining order only by seeking relief in the superior court under mass. r. civ. p. 65 . . . .  violation of such a restraining order may constitute a contempt of court, but is not a crime. . . .  chapter 258e was enacted in 2010 to allow individuals to obtain civil restraining orders against persons who are not family or household members, and to make the violation of those orders punishable as a crime.""o'brien, supra at 419.the seriousness of an order under c. 258e is reflected not only in the fact that violation is a criminal offense, but in the fact that records of all such orders are entered in the statewide domestic violence registry from which they may never be removed even if there was an insufficient legal or factual basis for their issuance.  see g. l. c. 258e, § 9; j.s.h. v. j.s., 109-110 (2017) (j.s.h.).such an order thus has significant and essentially indelible consequences for the person against whom it issues.page 760unsurprisingly in light of the language of the statute, our courts have issued orders based upon a variety of abusive and intimidating willful and malicious conduct characterized by hostility, amounting to what, in colloquial terms, we would describe as harassment.  in 2012, however, in o'brien, the supreme judicial court found that the language of the statute reached some activity protected by the first amendment.  o'brien, 461 mass. at 420.  rather than striking the statute down, the court gave it a ""narrowing construction.""  id. at 421.  although, confusingly, the law remains on the books in unamended form, under o'brien, a court may not issue a protective order thereunder simply on the basis of three acts characterized by hostility causing and intended to cause fear, intimidation, or abuse committed willfully and maliciously and aimed at a specific person.  rather, each of the three willful and malicious predicate acts aimed at a specific person must be either a ""true threat"" - which is what is at issue here, as in the other decided appellate cases addressing the statute - or ""fighting words"" -- which are not at issue here and which we can put to one side for present purposes, id. at 425 -- at least where the predicate act is not an intentional act either of unlawful violence, i.e., acts that ""attempt[] to cause or caus[e] physical harm,"" or that causes property damage that meets the other requirements of the statute.  g. l. c. 258e, § 1.  to qualify as a true threat, a threat must demonstrate ""a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals,"" virginia v. black, 538 u.s. 343, 359 (2003) (black) -- under c. 258e, the specific individual to whom the alleged predicate acts are directed.  further, to support an order under c. 258e, the true threats cannot be threats to do just any kind of harm; they must be intended to cause ""fear of physical harm"" or - again not relevant here - ""physical damage to property.""  o'brien, 461 mass. at 427.  even threats intended to do anything else to the specific individual will not amount to predicate acts for purposes of c. 258e, notwithstanding the language of the statute, and only a threat intended to cause fear of physical harm (or physical property damage) can qualify as one of the three predicate acts for purposes of c. 258e.  this is true even when the act is not characterized as one intended to cause ""fear"" (i.e., of physical harm), but as one intended to cause ""intimidation"" or ""abuse"" as well, even though the colloquial meaning of those two words is dramatically broader.  see id. at 425, 426-427 (""'intimidation in the constitutionally proscribable sense of the word ispage 761a type of true threat, where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.'  [black, supra] at 360. . . .  where the acts are aimed at a specific person, an intent to cause 'abuse' is certainly consistent with a true threat, because abuse is defined in [c. 258e] as 'attempting to cause or causing physical harm to another or placing another in fear of imminent serious physical harm.'  g. l. c. 258e, § 1"").  further, even when there are three predicate true threats intended to cause fear of physical harm, they must together in fact cause such fear.  see id. at 426 n.8.since o'brien, our appellate courts have repeatedly held in appeals from issuance of orders under c. 258e that conduct that might be considered harassing, intimidating, or abusive in the colloquial sense, and that thus might support issuance of an order under the plain language of the statute, was not adequate to meet the standard spelled out in o'brien.  see, e.g., seney v. morhy,, 64 (2014) (little league parent ""verbally attacked and threatened to have [plaintiff, an assistant coach,] thrown off the team in front of numerous other parents"" and ""attacked [plaintiff's] personal being in front of every single parent""); van liew v. stansfield,, 38-39 (2016) (defendant publically accused plaintiff of being corrupt and a liar and during telephone call loudly called plaintiff uneducated and stupid); gassman v. reason,, 9 (2016) (repeated complaints from downstairs neighbor about loud piano playing by neighbor in upstairs apartment); c.e.r. v. p.c.,, 127-128 (2017) (loud music played at all hours of night, use of strobe light at night, and installation of security cameras on property by tenants).the evidence and the orders at issue.  with this as background, we turn to the facts of this case.  in this case, the plaintiff, a.r., obtained orders under c. 258e against the defendants, l.c. and j.c., his mother- and father-in-law.  in his affidavit he alleged that the defendants accompanied their daughter (his wife, from whom he was separated) when the parents exchanged their young child, over whom they shared legal and physical custody, in public places.  according to a.r., there were several incidents in which l.c. would video record the exchanges, even though a.r. asked her not to, and the defendants would block his exit from the commercial establishment in which the exchange was taking place.  first, a.r. averred that on april 8, 2016, during one of these incidents, his daughter had removed her boot and he hadpage 762difficulty putting it on.  l.c. raised her voice, said, ""[y]ou put the boots on her,"" and stuck the video recorder within three feet of his face.  next, a.r. describes another incident that same day in which his daughter's coat zipper was stuck.  a.r. and l.c. got into an argument and l.c. ""brushed right past [him], . . . and placed [his] daughter into the stroller,"" and yelled at him, ""[t]he zipper is broken, repair it.  you must repair it.""  a.r. also describes another, undated incident from about two weeks before he signed the affidavit on april 13, 2016.  l.c. videotaped the whole exchange and stuck the video recorder in his face.  j.c. ""became noticeably agitated, glared at [him] and stated 'are you sure you [are] able to take best care of her?!' in a firm, nasty, condescending tone.""  he asked the defendants to move out of his way, they did not, and they finally moved after he asked again.  a.r. stated that he believed that this behavior was an attempt to provoke a response.  a.r. describes a final child exchange incident from about a month before the affidavit was signed in which l.c. stuck the video recorder in his face and both defendants blocked the exit, again moving only after he asked a second time.  according to a.r., j.c. ""gave [him] an intense look and made a derogatory comment and stance toward [him].""in addition to the incidents at the child exchanges, a.r. described an encounter in the late fall or early winter 2013 in new york, while he and his wife were visiting the defendants, during which l.c. ""chopped"" him, scratched him, kicked him, and threw him down the stairs.  he further stated that j.c. has punched and thrown him on the ground three times (once threatening to ""destroy [him]""), twice punched him in the jaw, and once threw him down the stairs.  the record does not disclose the number of separate incidents in which these events allegedly took place, but a.r. does aver that each instance of each type occurred on ""separate occasions"" from each other.  since a.r. described three instances of j.c. punching him and throwing him on the ground, a.r. thus describes at least three separate incidents involving j.c. that are unrelated to the child exchanges.  he did not say when the events with j.c. took place.  on april 13, 2016, an ex parte, temporary order pursuant to c. 258e was entered.at the two hearings on extending the order,a.r. gave testimony similar to what was in the affidavit and clarified that somepage 763child exchanges took place at a drycleaners and others at a cvs store.  he described the april 8 zipper incident in more detail, stating that l.c. argued with him over whether the zipper of the child's coat was broken and had a ""nasty and aggressive"" demeanor.  he also testified to a different incident, on march 31, 2016, which presumably was the same incident as the incident described in the affidavit as having occurred two weeks before it was signed, in which l.c. aggressively videotaped him and j.c. blocked the door.  videos of various child exchanges were shown, including those of the march 31 incident and april 8 incident involving the zipper.  most videos are security camera footage from the drycleaners and are date-stamped, but lack audio.  three videos were recorded at cvs on l.c.'s ""smart phone"" and have audio, but are not date-stamped.  in some of the videos, but not the march 31 incident or the april 8 incident involving the zipper, a.r. agreed at the hearing that there was no harassing behavior by either defendant.the videos do not fully corroborate a.r.'s description of the events as he recounted them in his affidavit.  there is no video of an incident involving the child's boot on april 8.  there is a phone-recorded, boot-related incident that l.c. in the video describes as occurring on march 27, but there is no evidence of l.c. raising her voice, blocking the door, or otherwise threatening a.r.the video of the april 8 zipper incident lacks audio, so it cannot corroborate (or contradict) a.r.'s sworn statement that l.c. yelled at him, ""[t]he zipper is broken, repair it.  you must repair it.""  however, the demeanor of the parties is consistent with their arguing over something, and a.r. does appear to be having trouble with the zipper.  because the march 31 video also lacks audio, it does not corroborate (or contradict) a.r.'s statement that j.c. made a derogatory comment towards him or that he requested that the parties move out of his way.  contrary to a.r.'s sworn statement, however, there is no point in the march 31 video at which j.c. blocks his exit in anything resembling a threatening manner.  while it is possible, given the parties' positioning and the timing of the events, that l.c. did not move out of the way whenpage 764asked, the same is not possible for j.c.there is also no video in which we can hear j.c. making a derogatory comment towards a.r.,and no video in which j.c. takes any physical stance that could be interpreted as threatening.at the hearings, a.r. also testified to the fall or winter 2013 incident with l.c. described in his affidavit.  in addition, he stated that j.c. had thrown him down the stairs, punched him, hit him in the upper back, and body slammed him ""more than twice.""  as in the affidavit, he did not say when these events involving j.c. occurred.at the end of the hearing, the judge issued two orders.  with respect to l.c., the judge said in full, ""[a]fter a 2 day hearing, + hearing from the [plaintiff], viewing of videos of incidents - the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant has harassed the [plaintiff] on more than 3 occasions exceptionally by videoing all of the drop off + pickups.""  with respect to j.c., she said in full, ""[a]fter a 2 party hearing - with video evidence + testimony of [plaintiff] + argument from the defense attorney, court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant [j.c.] has harassed the [plaintiff].""discussion.  in neither case did the judge specify what three acts within the judicially narrowed meaning of c. 258e supported her conclusions about either defendant, something we have seen repeatedly in appeals from the issuance of c. 258e orders.  we have viewed each of the videos admitted into evidence.  they demonstrate annoying and provocative action on the part of the defendant l.c.  she accompanies her daughter for pick ups and drop offs of her grandchild and, using a smart phone, she audio and video records a.r. during these interactions, despite a.r.'s repeated request that she not do so.at times she places the phone within a foot or two of a.r.  she insists without warrant that a.r. address problems with a zipper on the child's coat or with the childpage 765having taken off her boots.  a.r.'s counsel in closing during the june 14 hearing said:""imagine feeling - how would you feel - or anyone would feel, trying to pick up, drop off their daughter, just having three people stare at you and video-recording you. just waiting for you to screw up.  just waiting for you to use that evidence against him, just waiting to show [the child] crying when daddy's trying to fix something.  it's all to harass [a.r.].  there's no need for it.""we agree with counsel's description of l.c.'s conduct.  and a.r. may well have had available to him other avenues of legal recourse.  for example, he might have returned to the probate and family court seeking an order that these transfers occur in settings where l.c. was less likely to act in such an aggressive and provocative way, for example, at a police station.  but although ""[t]he inclination to issue an order for the parties to stay away from one another, concluding that such an order cannot do any harm, is understandable,"" given the ""significant collateral consequences for a defendant, consequences that cannot be undone completely, even when a court later determines that the order should not have issued in the first place,"" judges must take care to adhere to the standard set out in o'brien.  gassman, 90 mass. app. ct. at 8.while l.c. was certainly ""harassing"" the plaintiff in the colloquial sense, only two videos contain any conduct that could even arguably be seen as threatening the plaintiff with physical harm such that the conduct amounted to a predicate act of harassment as that word in the statute has been narrowed by the supreme judicial court.  first, in the march 31 video, after recording within inches of a.r.'s face, for a few brief moments after the transfer of the child to a.r. at a drycleaners, l.c. and her daughter might have been standing in the way of the door by which the plaintiff could exit the store.  second, in the april 8 video involving the zipper, l.c.'s aggressive pulling of the child toward a.r., coupled with l.c.'s demeanor towards him, might be seen as threatening a.r. with physical harm.the judge's written basis for the order against l.c. was three acts of harassment ""exceptionally by videoing all of the drop off [and] pickups.""  the meaning of this phrase is not entirely clear to us.  as our description of the test for harassment under the narrowed statute makes clear, merely video recording the drop off andpage 766pick up of a child in a contentious divorce in public does not amount to an act of harassment.  if we read the judge's order to encompass only conduct observed on the video recordings, and if we assume that the acts in the march 31 and april 8 videos meet the test for harassment, there are still only two predicate acts.  there is of course also the incident a.r. described in which l.c. chopped him, scratched him, kicked him, and pushed him down the stairs, but the judge made no finding as to whether this third incident occurred, which l.c. denies, and it is not clear whether the judge intended the order to be based solely on l.c.'s conduct in video recording the drop offs and pick ups of the child.  because clarification from the judge thus is necessary, the case against l.c. is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.as to j.c., the judge's order does not specify what the three predicate acts of harassment were.  there is no evidence in the videos of harassment by j.c.  a.r. averred and testified to at least three unrecorded incidents involving j.c. punching him and throwing him to the ground that could amount to at least three separate predicate acts that are unrelated to the child exchanges.  however, nothing in the order implies that the judge found that these unrecorded events occurred, and we decline to determine sua sponte whether they did and hence whether the requisite three instances of harassment took place.  consequently, we will remand the case involving j.c. so that the judge may clarify what the basis was for her conclusion that the statutory requirements were met with respect to j.c.to the extent that the judge did in fact intend to rely upon the unrecorded incidents in issuing either order, we note that the judge sustained an objection on relevance grounds to inquiry on cross-examination of a.r. into ""mental health issues"" that, the defendants argued, could have affected his memory.  the judge stated that the ""videos speak for themselves,"" but acknowledged that there were allegations of conduct not captured on the videos.  to the extent the judge would rely on these events not on video, ability to recall is obviously relevant and, to the extent there is foundation for it, the defendants on remand will be entitled to a further hearing at which they must be allowed to cross-examine a.r. about these issues.conclusion.  the cases are remanded for the judge to clarify the basis for extending the c. 258e order in each case.  unless her basis for extending either order included unrecorded incidents aspage 767described herein, such order shall be vacated.  if either of the orders was extended on the basis of such unrecorded incidents, she shall hold a further hearing with respect to that order or orders.  if, after that hearing, the judge concludes that either order is adequately supported as described in this opinion, the supported order or orders may remain in place, otherwise the judge shall vacate the order or orders.so

g. l. c. 151, § 1a (failure to pay overtime wages) (count 2); g. l. c. 151, § 15 (failure to keep accurate payment records) (count 3); and breach of contract (count 4).  after the defendant filed an initial motion to dismiss, tortolano amended her complaint to add a fifth count, invoking g. l. c. 149, § 30b.there were two successive motions to dismiss filed with respect to tortolano's claims.  in ruling on the first motion, the judge dismissed the first three counts of tortolano's complaint, relating to purported violations of the commonwealth's wage laws other than g. l. c. 149, § 30b.the judge denied the hospital's motion with respect to the breach of contract claim, however, accepting tortolano's allegations that she had exhausted her administrative remedies by filing a complaint with the attorney general's office, and that the hospital had repudiated or nullified the cba by ignoring her grievances.after tortolano amended her complaint to add the § 30b claim, the hospital filed a second motion to dismiss.  as to tortolano's breach of contract claim, the hospital this time attached the sections of the cba setting forth the grievance procedure.  the hospital urged that tortolano had failed to exhaust that procedure, because under the cba she could have, but did not, continue to pursue her grievances after the hospital failed to respond to her initial filings.  the hospital also moved to dismiss the newly added fifth count of tortolano's amended complaint, on the ground that there is no private right of action to enforce g. l. c. 149, § 30b.  in a decision dated january 20, 2017, the judge accepted the hospital's arguments and dismissed both the § 30b and contract claims.  judgment entered for the hospital, and the present appeal followed.discussion.  1.  standard of review.  in reviewing the allowance of a motion to dismiss under mass.r.civ.p. 12(b)(6),  365 mass. 754  (1974), we accept the factual allegations in a plaintiff's complaint, and any favorable inferences reasonably drawn therefrom,page 776as true.  see ginther v. commissioner of ins.,, 322 (1998).  our review is de novo.  see curtis v. herb chambers i-95, inc.,, 676 (2011).  ""[w]e look beyond the conclusory allegations in the complaint and focus on whether the factual allegations plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.""  ibid.  see iannacchino v. ford motor co.,, 635-636 (2008).2.  breach of contract.  tortolano contends that the judge erred in dismissing her breach of contract claim on the ground that she failed to exhaust the grievance procedure in the cba.  there was no error.in general, where a collective bargaining agreement includes a grievance procedure, ""failure to pursue contractual grievance procedures bars suit against the employer.""  johnston v. school comm. of watertown,, 25 (1989).  see o'brien v. new england tel. & tel. co.,, 695 (1996).  ""employees may not simply disregard the grievance procedures set out in a collective labor contract and go direct to court for redress against the employer.""  balsavich v. local 170, intl. bhd. of teamsters,, 286 (1976).section 25.2 of the cba sets forth a four-step grievance procedure for resolving disputes under the cba.  the first step is for an employee or the union to submit a written grievance to the hospital, which, in turn, shall provide a written response to the grievance within seven days.  if either the employee or the union is dissatisfied with the grievance decision, the cba provides, in steps 2 and 3, for two more appeals within the hospital, after which arbitration may be invoked.  importantly, section 25.6 of the cba further provides that if the hospital exceeds any time limit for responding, the employee or the union may assume thatpage 777the grievance has been denied and may invoke the next step of the procedure, except that only the union may request arbitration in the fourth step.here, the grievance procedure was never exhausted because neither tortolano nor the union proceeded beyond step 1.  pursuant to the cba's express terms, when the hospital did not respond to tortolano's grievances within the prescribed time period, the grievances were deemed denied, and either tortolano or the union was permitted to invoke the second step of the process.  tortolano could have done so, without the union's involvement.  rather than continue with the grievance process, however, tortolano brought this lawsuit.this case accordingly is controlled by johnston, 404 mass. at 24-25.  in that case, the court considered whether an employee's failure to pursue contractual grievance procedures when faced with union inaction barred a breach of contract claim against his employer.  there, the union refused to represent the employee in pursuing his claim for overtime pay because the union determined that the claim lacked merit.  the court stated that, even if it assumed that the union had failed to fulfil its duty of fair representation, the employee had the right, under the collective bargaining agreement, to pursue his grievance independent of the union.  given that the employee had not fully complied with the agreement's grievance procedure, he could not pursue his contract claim against the employer in court.  see ibid.  moreover, the johnston court made clear that, except in limited circumstances not present here, any claim by the public employee against the union for breach of the duty of fair representation must be presented first to the labor relations commission (now the department of labor relations, see g. l. c. 150e, § 11, as amended through st. 2011, c. 3, §§ 141-143), not to a trial court.  see id. at 26-27.johnston thus establishes that tortolano's contract claim must be dismissed.  the grievance procedure was not exhausted before this suit was filed.  although this case differs from johnston in that here the union invoked the first step of the grievance procedure, tortolano could have progressed through the next two steps without the union's involvement, and tortolano does not allege or argue that she was inhibited from doing so.  moreover, even if the union was at fault for the failure to exhaust, tortolano's remedy was to seek relief from the department of labor relations, before resorting to the courts.  see ibid.  she did not do so.page 778finally, tortolano cannot avoid the grievance process by pointing to the inaction of the employer.  the cba expressly contemplated such inaction, by providing that the employer's failure to respond constituted a denial of the grievance, thereby permitting the employee to move forward in the process.  the hospital's unresponsiveness to tortolano's grievances therefore did not constitute a repudiation or nullification of the grievance machinery -- she needed to continue pursuing the grievance procedure set forth in the cba.  see balsavich, 371 mass. at 286; azzi v. western elec. co.,, 408-409 (1985).3.  violation of g. l. c. 149, § 30b.  tortolano next contends that the motion judge erred in ruling that she had no private right of action under g. l. c. 149, § 30b.  she asserts that the statute must be broadly construed to effectuate its purpose of protecting the right of public employees to overtime wages.  see generally crocker v. townsend oil co.,, 13 (2012) (""[t]he legislative purpose behind the wage act . . . is to provide strong statutory protection for employees and their right to wages"").  moreover, tortolano argues that the letter she received from the attorney general's office authorized her to file this suit, thereby in essence conferring upon her a private right of action.  the judge did not err in dismissing this claim.there is no express private right of action for violations of g. l. c. 149, § 30b, so the question is whether one should be inferred in light of the statutory scheme and the legislature's purpose and intent.  see loffredo v. center for addictive behaviors,, 543 (1998).  see also salvas v. wal-mart stores, inc.,, 373 (2008).  the touchstone is the intent of the legislature.  in evaluating intent, one important consideration is what enforcement provisions are set forth in the statute itself.  see ibid.with respect to c. 149, the general enforcement power is vested in the attorney general:""the attorney general shall,, enforce the provisions of this chapter, and shall have all necessary powers therefor""  (emphasis added).g. l. c. 149, § 2, as amended by st. 1996, c. 151, § 368.  importantly, there are several provisions of c. 149 that grant express private rights of action for violations of certain sections of the statute, but none that provide a right of action with respectpage 779to § 30b.  see, e.g., g. l. c. 149, § 27 (employee aggrieved by violation of prevailing wage law may initiate civil action after filing complaint with attorney general); g. l. c. 149, § 150, as amended through st. 2014, c. 505, § 2 (employee aggrieved by violation of g. l. c. 149, §§ 33e, 52e, 148, 148a, 148b, 148c, 150c, 152, 152a, 159c, or 190, or by violation of g. l. c. 151, § 19, may ""institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf . . . a civil action for injunctive relief, for any damages . . . , and for any lost wages"" after filing complaint with attorney general); g. l. c. 149, § 185(d) (employee subject to retaliation may institute civil action in superior court).the question here is in large part controlled by the reasoning in salvas, 452 mass. at 372-373, which held that there is no private right of action under another section of c. 149 -- § 100 (requiring meal breaks for employees).  as salvas points out, the many express private rights of action in c. 149 demonstrate that the legislature knows how to confer a private right of action when it so intends, and the c. 149 provisions are a strong indication that no further private rights of action should be inferred.  see id. at 373.  moreover, the massachusetts courts are ""reluctant to infer a private cause of action from a statute in the absence of some indication from the legislature supporting such an inference.""  loffredo, 426 mass. at 544.  see transamerica mort. advisors, inc. v. lewis, 444 u.s. 11, 19 (1979) (""[i]t is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it"").  the express language of g. l. c. 149, § 2, authorizing enforcement of c. 149 by the attorney general unless otherwise specifically provided, coupled with the granting of private rights of action in certain sections of c. 149, but none encompassing § 30b or in § 30b itself, signifies that the provisions of § 30b can be enforced only by the attorney general.  see salvas, 452 mass. at 373; mello constr., inc. v. division of capital asset mgmt.,, 629-630 (2013).finally, we turn to the matter of the letter from the attorney general's office.  tortolano's argument in this court -- that the letter conferred on her the right to bring an action in her own name under g. l. c. 149, § 30b -- was not raised in either her amended complaint or in her opposition to the hospital's motionpage 780to dismiss the fifth count of that complaint.accordingly, this argument was waived.  see palmer v. murphy,, 338 (1997).  see also carey v. new england organ bank,, 285 (2006).even if it had been properly raised, however, the argument would fail.  as indicated, under the statutory scheme, the authority to enforce g. l. c. 149, § 30b, rests with the attorney general.  see g. l. c. 149, § 2.  tortolano asserts that the attorney general's letter passed the enforcement power on to her, but we do not agree.  first, the letter did not appoint tortolano, or her counsel, to act as a special assistant attorney general, working on behalf of and subject to the attorney general's control.  see generally g. l. c. 12, § 3 (attorney general shall appear for commonwealth, and ""[a]ll such suits and proceedings shall be prosecuted or defended by [her] or under [her] direction""); new england div. of the am. cancer soc. v. commissioner of admin.,, 173 n.5 (2002).  indeed, the suit is not brought on behalf of the commonwealth -- tortolano is the named plaintiff.second, while the letter does authorize tortolano to bring a private right of action under some sections of c. 149, the attorney general was without power to confer such a private right of action with respect to § 30b.  where, as discussed above, the legislature has not provided a private right of action, the attorney general cannot create an alternative enforcement mechanism by unilaterally conferring such a private right of action on an individual.see local 1445, united food & commercial wkrs.page 781union v. police chief of natick,, 558 (1990).conclusion.  for the foregoing reasons, there was no error in the dismissal of the amended complaint.judgment affirmed.",civil,Elizabeth M.

1704,"r.l. currie corp.  vs.  east coast sand and gravel, inc.","negligence, foreseeability of harm.in a civil action alleging negligence arising from damage to the plaintiff's trucks after the defendant, who shared a lot with the plaintiff, left a front-end loader unlocked, unattended, and idling with keys in the ignition, the judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, where the damage to the plaintiff's trucks by an unauthorized individual was reasonably foreseeable, in that the front-end loader was a large, heavy-duty vehicle capable of causing damage in the hands of inexperienced drivers, the defendant failed to follow its usual practice of securing its equipment by hiding the keys, there had been prior unauthorized entry onto the lot, and the defendant knew that the plaintiff stored its equipment on the shared lot. [783-786]","this case presents the issue whether the defendant (having left heavy-duty equipment unlocked, unattended, and running idle with keys in the ignition on a lot shared with the plaintiff) has a duty of care to the plaintiff whose property was damaged by an unauthorized third-party user of the equipment.  concluding that the unauthorized use was not reasonably foreseeable, a superior court judge granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiff's claim for negligence.we reverse.page 783background.  we summarize the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the party opposing summary judgment.  see herbert a. sullivan, inc. v. utica mut. ins. co.,, 393 (2003).  the parties shared a lot where they stored trucks and other heavy-duty equipment used in their respective businesses.  the defendant provides snow plowing services.during a snowstorm in january of 2014, at approximately 10:00 p.m., the defendant's employee left a front-end loader running idle, unattended, and unlocked on the lot with the keys in the ignition.the employee returned to the lot at 2:00 a.m.  in the interim, an unknown and unauthorized third party had driven the front-end loader into two of the plaintiff's trucks, causing extensive damage.although there had been previous incidents where items such as batteries and steel had been stolen from the lot, this was the first incident involving unauthorized use of the defendant's equipment.  it was the defendant's practice to leave the keys to its front-end loaders, usually hidden, inside the vehicles.  at least one of the defendant's employees, nonetheless, did not adhere to this practice because he did not want anyone else driving his vehicle.following this incident, the plaintiff filed a complaint alleging, inter alia, that the defendant was negligent in failing to properly secure the front-end loader.  on cross motions for summary judgment, the judge granted the defendant's motion.  the judge concluded that the defendant did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had no reasonable expectation of proving causation at trial because the damage to the plaintiff's trucks was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions.  the plaintiff appealed.discussion.  summary judgment is to be granted where, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there are no genuine issues as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  mass.r.civ.p. 56(c), as amended,  436 mass. 1404  (2002).  see cargill, inc. v.page 784beaver coal & oil co.,, 358 (1997).  ""[the] party moving for summary judgment in a case in which the opposing party will have the burden of proof at trial is entitled to summary judgment if he demonstrates . . . that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party's case.""  dulgarian v. stone,, 846 (1995), quoting from symmons v. o'keefe,, 293 (1995).  our review is de novo.  chambers v. rdi logistics, inc.,, 99 (2016).to prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty, (2) the defendant breached this duty, (3) damage to the plaintiff resulted, and (4) there was a causal relationship between the breach of the duty and the damage.  see jupin v. kask,, 146 (2006).  ""[t]he existence of a duty is question of law, and is thus an appropriate subject of summary judgment.""  ibid.  in addition, while each of the other elements typically involve questions of fact suitable for resolution by a jury, see, e.g., mullins v. pine manor college,, 58 (1983), proximate cause may be resolved as a matter of law, where ""a plaintiff has no reasonable expectation of proving that 'the injury to the plaintiff was a foreseeable result of the defendant's negligent conduct.'""  hebert v. enos,, 820-821 (2004), quoting from kent v. commonwealth,, 320 (2002).""[a] defendant owes a duty of care to all persons who are foreseeably endangered by his conduct, with respect to all risks which make the conduct unreasonably dangerous.""  jupin, 447 mass. at 147, quoting from tarasoff v. regents of the univ. of cal., 17 cal. 3d 425, 434-435 (1976).""the word 'foreseeable' has been used to define both the limits of a duty of care and the limits of proximate cause. . . .  as a practical matter, in deciding the foreseeability question, it seems not important whether one defines a duty as limited to guarding against reasonably foreseeable risks of harm or whether one defines the necessary causal connection between a breach of duty and some harm as one in which the harm was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the breach of a duty.""whittaker v. saraceno,, 198-199 (1994).in the present case, the defendant maintains that the plaintiff has no reasonable expectation of proving that the third party'spage 785unauthorized use of the defendant's front-end loader, and the resulting harm to the plaintiff's trucks, were reasonably foreseeable consequences of leaving an unsecured and idling front-end loader in the shared lot.we disagree.the supreme judicial court's decision in jesionek v. massachusetts port authy.,(1978), is instructive.  there, the port authority left an unsecured forklift on its property with the keys in the ignition, and a drunken seaman then drove it into a civilian visitor.  id. at 102-104.  the court declined to apply the ""keys left in ignitions"" line of cases, which had absolved a vehicle owner of liability for the actions of a third party who stole the vehicle.id. at 105 n.3.  the doctrine, the court stated, was ""narrow"" and thus inapplicable to the facts of the case before it because the third party had merely taken the vehicle for a joyride and not stolen it.  id. at 105.  see poskus v. lombardo's of randolph, inc.,, 640 (1996) (""[t]he reasoning of cases involving keys negligently left in ignitions is no longer persuasive"").  instead, the court held that ""[t]he act of a third person, intervening and contributing a condition necessary to the injurious effect of the original negligence, will not excuse the first wrongdoer, if such act ought to have been foreseen.""  jesionek, supra at 105, quoting from lane v. atlantic works,, 139-140 (1872).  see poskus, 423 mass. at 640 (""if a person negligently makes the theft of a motor vehicle possible, it would be reasonably foreseeable in certain circumstances that a third person could be harmed by the thief's negligent operation of the stolen vehicle"").in holding that the jury were warranted in finding that the seaman's actions and the civilian's injuries were reasonably foreseeable, the court in jesionek relied on several factors, including that the forklift had an unusual steering system which made it dangerous in the hands of inexperienced drivers, the port authority had specific procedures for securing the forklift, which were not followed, and the port authority knew civilians and intoxicated seamen both frequented the area.  jesionek, 376 mass. at 106.  similarly, here, the front-end loader is a large, heavy-dutypage 786vehicle capable of causing damage in the hands of inexperienced drivers, the defendant failed to follow its usual practice of securing its equipment by hiding the keys,there had been prior unauthorized entry onto the property, and the defendant knew that the plaintiff stored its equipment on the shared lot.  in these circumstances, a jury could find that it was reasonably foreseeable that the front-end loader, when left unlocked, unattended, running idle, and with keys in the ignition, might be operated by an unauthorized individual so as to cause damage to the plaintiff's property on the shared lot.  see ibid.poskus, relied upon by the defendant, does not support a different result.  in that case, the court held that the defendant, a nightclub that negligently allowed a thief to steal a motor vehicle that its valet service had parked, did not owe a duty to the plaintiff, a local police officer, who saw the stolen vehicle hours after the theft, attempted to stop it, and was injured when he fell as he attempted to apprehend the fleeing thief.  poskus, 423 mass. at 640.  here, the harm that occurred to the plaintiff's trucks was not so attenuated; indeed, a jury could reasonably find that it was precisely the type of harm that was a foreseeable consequence of leaving heavy-duty equipment unlocked, unattended, and idling on a shared lot on which the plaintiff stored its trucks.finally, the defendant maintains that, while theft of the front-end loader and its subsequent negligent operation might have been foreseeable, the specific third-party act here -- what appears to have been intentional vandalism of the plaintiff's vehicles -- was not.  the foreseeability standard, however, ""does not require the particular act which caused the injury to have been foreseen, only that the general character and probability of the injury be foreseeable.""  glick v. prince italian foods of saugus, inc.,, 902 (1987).  in this case, as in jesionek, 376 mass. at 106, the damage to the plaintiff's property was not, as a matter of law, an unforeseeable consequence of the defendant's failure to secure its equipment.conclusion.  that portion of the judgment entered on june 27, 2017, dismissing count 1 of the complaint is reversed.  in all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.so ordered.",civil,None,partially reverse
1705,"the landing group, inc.  vs.  department of environmental protection & another.","department of environmental protection.  administrative law, primary jurisdiction, decision.in a civil action challenging a decision of the department of environmental protection (department) denying an application for a license amendment to construct a residential and commercial development with maritime aspects on private and commonwealth tidelands in a harbor, the superior court judge properly granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the department, where the department was not bound to accept the plaintiff's attempt, via electronic mail messages and a letter, to effect a partial withdrawal of its plan and to limit the department's review to the waterside-only portions of plans that the plaintiff had submitted that were far more comprehensive; further, this court declined to approve a plan attached to one of the plaintiff's rebuttal briefs, where under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the department was required to undertake the review of any proposal in the first instance. [790-791]","this case arose when the plaintiff, the landing group, inc., applied to the department of environmental protection (dep) for a license amendment under g. l. c. 91 and 310 code mass. regs. §§ 9.00 et seq. (2008), to construct a residential and commercial development with maritime aspects, such as a dock, on private and commonwealth tidelands in pigeon cove harbor in rockport.  the application sought an amendment of apage 789license issued in 2008 by the dep to the previous owner of the property.  a public hearing was held on the plan the plaintiff submitted with the application, and the plans were twice revised during the public comment and hearing process.after the second amendment was accepted by the dep, an additional hearing was held on that amended plan because, by that point, the dep had found that the proposal was so different from the one originally submitted that a new public comment period was required.  in each of the two cases of amendment, new plans were submitted by the plaintiff, all including both waterside and nonwaterside uses.after the second hearing was held on the ""revised final project plans"" submitted in march, 2014, the plaintiff sent an electronic mail message (e-mail) to the dep purporting to ""withdraw[] the pending license amendment application as being reviewed pursuant to any procedure other than [§] 20 of [g. l. c.] 91.""general laws c. 91, § 20, provides a more limited dep review of plans for building bridges, wharves, piers, and dams over tidewaters under legislative authorizations of which several hundred were enacted in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  see trio algarvio, inc. v. commissioner of the dept. of envtl. protection,, 95 (2003).  after private development spurred by these authorizations became ""rapid and chaotic,"" the legislature in 1866 passed a statute creating a board of harbor commissioners -- the dep's predecessor -- whose permission would be required for building on tidelands where the authority to build derived from past legislative authorizations.  see id. at 99-100.  see also st. 1866, c. 149.  according to the current version of § 20, the dep may review plans with respect to these tidelands only for their consistency with the legislative authorization, and may only alter them ""consistent with the legislative grant.""  this contrasts with the dep's review of most other projects, according to which the dep may issue a license or permit only if the project ""serves a proper public purpose which provides greater benefit than detriment to the rights of the public in said lands.""  310 code mass. regs. § 9.31(2) (1996).the plaintiff's e-mail was apparently intended to convey that it now sought review only under g. l. c. 91, § 20.  for the first time the plaintiff suggested that there was legislative authorization for development of the property under an 1831 statute which is denominated ""an act to incorporate the pigeon cove harbor company.""  st. 1831, c. 34.  a further e-mail reiterated that § 20 appliedpage 790and that the dep review was limited to determining whether there was ""conformance with the authorizing legislation.""finally, on august 20, 2014, plaintiff's counsel sent a five-page letter to the dep which stated more clearly that the plaintiff purported to withdraw its plans seeking approval of the land-based development, and that it sought approval only of the ""in-water work"" aspect of the plans it had filed.  no new plans showing only these so-called ""waterside"" uses - the nomenclature used by dep before us and that we will also employ for present purposes - were filed with any of these e-mails or the letter.in december, 2014, the dep issued an order signed by the program director of the dep's wetlands and waterways regulation program denying the amended application for a license amendment.  that decision reviewed the amended plan submitted in march, 2014.  that is, the dep did not review only the waterside portion of the plan under g. l. c. 91, § 20, but reviewed the amended plan on which the hearing had been held.on appeal first to the office of appeals and dispute resolution of the dep, and now before the courts, the plaintiff argues primarily that the dep erred in failing to evaluate only the waterside portion of its plan.  for the first time, the plaintiff presented a plan showing only the waterside development, the development of which it claims it seeks approval, as an attachment to its rebuttal brief before the office of appeals and dispute resolution.we agree with the detailed and thoughtful memorandum and decision of the judge of the superior court who ruled on the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings, that the dep was not bound to accept the midstream partial withdrawal of the plaintiff's march, 2014, plan and to review the waterside-only portions of the far more comprehensive plans submitted by the plaintiff as requested in the e-mails and the letter sent to the dep.  the plaintiff points to no provision of law requiring the dep to accept an amendment of an application sought by this irregular process.  further, among other things, the plaintiff did not even provide a plan showing only the work for which it purports to have been seeking approval, and the dep cannot be faulted for failing to evaluate a plan that was never even put before it.  see 310 code mass. regs. § 9.11(3)(c)(1) (2008) (complete application to dep must contain ""a set of final plans which are prepared in accordance with the format standards required for recording of licenses in the appropriate registry of deeds or land court for the district in which the licensed activity is to be performed; andpage 791which are certified by a registered professional engineer or land surveyor,"" and which meet further requirements); 310 code mass. regs. § 9.24(1) (1996) (license amendment application requires submission of ""appropriate plans"").this does not mean the plaintiff's opportunity for evaluation of its waterside-only proposal has been waived.  as the judge found, and as the dep conceded at oral argument before us, the plaintiff remains free to submit a waterside-only proposal, with an accompanying plan that satisfies the regulations, to the dep for review.  but at no time since the superior court judgment entered over seventeen months ago, indeed, at no time since the dep ruled on the plaintiff's amended proposal over three years ago, has it done so.to the extent the plaintiff asks us to cut to the chase and approve under g. l. c. 91, § 20, the plan attached to its rebuttal brief before the office of appeals and dispute resolution, we decline the invitation.  we agree with the dep that the doctrine of primary jurisdiction requires the dep to undertake the review of any proposal in the first instance.  see department of envtl. quality engr. v. cumberland farms of conn., inc.,, 676 (1984).  among other things, there are unresolved legal and factual issues at least some of which must be addressed in an appropriate dep proceeding in order properly to complete § 20 review, including the nature of the grant in the 1831 statute; whether that grant runs with the land or was personal to the pigeon cove harbor company; whether the separation of ownership between a breakwater whose maintenance was required of the pigeon cove harbor company by

[794-799]","following a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of possession of a firearm, second offense,and possession of a loaded firearm.  on appeal, the defendant argues that a superior court judge (motion judge) erred in denying his motion to suppress the firearm and some cash discovered during a stop of the vehicle in which the defendant was a passenger.  the defendant asserts that police conduct during the stop -- including boxing the vehicle inpage 793and approaching with guns drawn -- escalated the encounter to an arrest, for which probable cause was lacking.after considering the circumstances as a whole, we conclude that the officers' show of force was sufficiently significant to convert the stop to an arrest.  because the commonwealth concedes that there was no probable cause to arrest the defendant at the time, the motion to suppress should have been allowed.  accordingly, we reverse the convictions.1.  background.  we summarize the motion judge's detailed findings of fact, supplementing with additional facts from testimony that the judge implicitly credited.  see commonwealth v. isaiah i.,, 337 (2007), s.c.,(2008).  here, the defendant concedes that police had reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of the vehicle in which he was traveling, based on evidence of drug dealing as well as traffic violations.  we therefore focus our recitation on the facts relevant to the defendant's challenge on appeal.in the summer of 2014, state police were conducting an investigation into suspected drug dealing in lawrence, centering on the defendant, and using a confidential informant.  during the investigation, officers determined that the defendant was known to the lawrence police and had a prior conviction of a firearms offense.  the confidential informant told police that the defendant was selling cocaine and was ""involved with firearms.""on august 6, 2014, police initiated surveillance of the defendant based on the informant's report that the defendant would be traveling to lynn to pick up cocaine to bring to lawrence.  the surveillance team comprised multiple officers from the state police, the federal drug enforcement administration, and the federal bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives, in unmarked vehicles.  during the course of the surveillance, officers observed the defendant, along with three other men about whom police apparently had no information,depart a home in lawrence in a red gmc envoy sport utility vehicle.  the defendant was seated in the right rear passenger's seat.  the surveillance team followed the gmc surreptitiously.  after making a number of stops in lawrence and then in lynn, at about 6:00 p.m. the defendant and his companions proceeded in the gmc to route 114 westbound toward lawrence.page 794when the gmc reached a point where the road widened from one to two lanes and motorists often accelerate to pass slower vehicles, it suddenly more than doubled its speed, operating well over the posted speed limit.  believing that the gmc's occupants had detected the surveillance, officers decided to stop the gmc, rather than waiting for its expected return to lawrence, as they had originally planned.officers contacted a uniformed state trooper who was patrolling the area in a marked cruiser and asked him to stop the vehicle.  the trooper observed the gmc cross the double yellow line in the middle of the road twice.  he turned on his cruiser's flashing lights, and the gmc pulled over promptly.  the trooper's cruiser and at least three other unmarked police cars moved in around the gmc, effectively boxing it in.four or five officers simultaneously approached the gmc's four doors, yelling for the occupants to raise their hands.  at least two of the officers had their guns drawn.  as one officer neared the gmc, he observed the defendant, who was still sitting in the right rear passenger's seat, reach forward, pull open the seat-back pocket in front of him, and stuff an object into it.  suspecting that the defendant had attempted to conceal a firearm, the officer opened the left rear door and ordered the rear seat passengers not to move.  he observed a firearm in the seat-back pocket in front of the defendant.officers ordered the defendant and other passengers out of the gmc and recovered a loaded revolver from the seat-back pocket.  the defendant was arrested and searched, and just under $5,500 in cash was found on his person.  no drugs were found.2.  discussion.  the defendant agrees on appeal that the stop of the gmc was lawful and supported by observed traffic violations as well as reasonable suspicion of drug dealing.  he maintains, however, that his motion to suppress was improperly denied because police conduct escalated the seizure to an arrest without probable cause.we agree.in reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge's subsidiary findings unless clearly erroneous, see commonwealth v. white,, 137 (1977), aff'd, 439 u.s. 280 (1978), and make an ""independent determination on the correctnesspage 795of the judge's 'application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.'""  commonwealth v. haas,, 550 (1977), s.c.,(1986), quoting from brewer v. williams, 430 u.s. 387, 403 (1977).""the constitution does not require officers 'to gamble with their personal safety,' commonwealth v. robbins,, 152 (1990), and police officers conducting a threshold inquiry may take reasonable precautions, including drawing their weapons, when the circumstances give rise to legitimate safety concerns.""

""such steps do not automatically turn a stop into an arrest.""  commonwealth v. dyette,, 556 (2015), quoting from commonwealth v. williams,, 117 (1996).whether a police seizure has been transformed into an arrest ""depends on the proportional relationship of the degree of intrusiveness on the defendant to the degree of suspicion that prompted the intrusion.""  commonwealth v. willis,, 819 (1993).  this determination is highly fact-specific, and in assessing the reasonableness of the officers' conduct, we view the facts and circumstances ""as a whole.""  williams, 422 mass. at 116.we have held that ""[a]n approach with drawn guns is generally thought excessive in the absence of any suggestion that the defendant is armed or other circumstances suggesting the possibility of violence.""  commonwealth v. fitzgibbons,, 308 (1986).  even with information suggesting that a defendant possesses a firearm illegally, however, police are not generally justified in drawing their guns in the absence of additional ""fear-provoking circumstances.""  commonwealth v. bottari,, 782 (1985).  when considering a vehicle stop, ""we also look to the number of police used to effectuate the stop and whether the movement of the automobile was impeded.""  commonwealth v. sanderson,, 766 (1986).here, the police response, viewed as whole, included the presence of multiple cars and officers, the use of four police vehicles to box the gmc in, and the approach of at least two officers with guns drawn.  we conclude that this was disproportionate ""to the degree of suspicion that prompted the intrusion"" and constituted an arrest.  willis, 415 mass. at 819.  the surrounding circumstances here lacked factors present in other cases that held such precautions justified even absent probable cause.here, ""[t]he officers' use of force was not precipitated by any actions of the defendant[], nor did the officers testify that theypage 796feared for their safety or the safety of others at the time they approached the [gmc] with their guns drawn.""  bottari, 395 mass. at 782.  though it is certainly relevant that police had information as to the defendant's prior nonspecific ""involvement"" in firearms and knew the defendant to have had a prior firearms conviction, they had no particular information suggesting that he possessed a firearm at the time of the stop.  cf. willis, 415 mass. at 815-816, 819 (officers had detailed information that defendant with previous arrest for armed robbery was carrying loaded stolen gun at time of seizure); haskell, 438 mass. at 793-794 (officers received reliable report that defendant was seen publicly loading handgun in high-crime area at 2:00 a.m.); commonwealth v. mckoy,, 314 (2013) (defendant and companion were coming from direction of reported shooting, were only persons on street, and had hands in pockets).the officers had no information about any history of violent conduct on the part of the defendant.  cf. commonwealth v. ruiz,, 347-351 (2001) (police show of force did not transform seizure into arrest, where defendants were suspected of just having committed home invasion).  though police information regarding the defendant's possible drug dealing is relevant in our analysis, ""case law often observes that the mere fact that drugs are involved does not support the view that guns or other weapons are present.""  commonwealth v. cabrera,, 348 (2010).  see commonwealth v. washington,, 482 (2007) (""we are reluctant to adopt a blanket rule that all persons suspected of drug activity are to be presumed armed and dangerous for constitutional purposes"").we acknowledge, as the commonwealth argues, ""that drug offenses frequently involve drug dealers being armed and that, in many cases, shootings and killings occur when a drug dealer is confronted by police, when a drug deal goes 'bad,' or when others try to steal the drugs.""  commonwealth v. hines,, 189 (2007).  see commonwealth v. cannon,, 470 (2007) (same).  but neither hines nor cannon involved any question whether a police display of force was disproportionate in particular circumstances.neither decision suggested that police are justified in drawing their weapons whenever they approach apage 797drug suspect.cf. commonwealth v. jimenez,, 216-220 (2002) (that drug dealers may often have guns does not justify no-knock search warrant in every drug case; what is required is probable cause to believe officer safety would be jeopardized by observing knock and announce rule in the particular circumstances).at the time of the show of force here, police had not observed any furtive conduct by the defendant or his companions.  concerns about flight raised by the gmc's increase in speed would have been substantially alleviated when the vehicle promptly and uneventfully stopped when signaled by the marked cruiser.nor had any of the gmc's four occupants refused any police orders.  cf. commonwealth v. torres,, 670-671 (2001) (officer did not escalate stop to arrest by drawing gun, after passengers in vehicle he had stopped had ""bent over"" to ""mess[] with something"" on vehicle floor and three of them failed to obey instruction to place hands on heads).the officers were a part of an organized surveillance team comprising multiple state and federal officers and were not outnumbered by the defendant and his companions.  cf. cabrera, 76 mass. app. ct. at 349 (two officers, outnumbered by five drug suspects in dead-end alley at night, had legitimate safety concerns justifying call for backup before patfrisk).  there was no evidence that the location of the stop was associated in any way with past crimes of violence.  cf. dyette, 87 mass. app. ct. at 549, 556-557.in urging that the police conduct here at issue was a stop rather than an arrest, the commonwealth relies largely on willis and dyette.  that reliance is unavailing.  in willis, the information available to police raised significant articulable safety concerns:  at the time of the stop, the defendant was reasonably believed to possesspage 798a loaded, stolen handgun, and the defendant had a prior arrest for a violent crime involving a weapon.  willis, 415 mass. at 815-816, 819.  here, the safety concerns were considerably less substantial.  police information as to the defendant's history with firearms was vague and did not involve violence, and police had no information that the defendant possessed any firearm at the time of the stop.similarly, dyette involved multiple factors raising safety concerns not present here.  in that case, officers in an unmarked car noticed the defendant trespassing in a park close to midnight.  dyette, 87 mass. app. ct. at 550.  the park, closed and unlit, was known ""as an area of high firearm activity, including homicides and other shootings.""  id. at 549.  after spotting the officers, the defendant and his companion fled, ""colliding with each other as they ran.""  id. at 550.  several officers gave chase on foot, but the defendant eluded them until a lone officer stationed at a park exit saw him, recognized him from ""numerous"" prior encounters ""including a firearm arrest,"" and ordered him to the ground at gunpoint.  ibid.in contrast to dyette, where the defendant engaged in plain (and chaotic) flight from officers, and halted only after the challenged show of force, here the evidence of flight was more equivocal, and ameliorated by the prompt compliance by the driver of the gmc with the police signal to stop.  unlike in dyette, the place of the stop in this case was neither one at which the defendant's presence was itself suspicious nor one associated with past violent crime.  additionally, dyette involved a fleeing suspect's sudden encounter with a lone officer, who was forced to make a split-second decision about his own safety.  here the officers were engaged in a coordinated surveillance operation in which four police vehicles participated in the stop of the gmc; the officers decided when to make the stop and had time to discuss how they would proceed once the gmc pulled over.we recognize that the fact-specific decisional law in this area may at times pose a difficult dilemma for police officers: ""if the officer approaches a suspect[] . . . with his gun still in his holster, he increases the risk that he will be shot.  if, on the other hand, he protects himself by drawing his gun, he increases the risk that a court will set the criminal free by construing his action as an illegal arrest.""  fitzgibbons, 23 mass. app. ct. at 305, quoting frompage 799united states v. jackson, 652 f.2d 244, 249-250 (2d cir.), cert. denied, 454 u.s. 1057 (1981).  and we emphasize that even when police lack probable cause to arrest, they may draw their guns or otherwise show force, to protect themselves or others, when such a display is ""proportional . . . to the degree of suspicion"" based on all relevant circumstances.  willis, 415 mass. at 819.  we have discussed supra some of the numerous decisions illustrating circumstances in which officers may reasonably draw their weapons.  to those, we add commonwealth v. emuakpor,, 193-195, 199 (2003) (two officers justified in blocking vehicle and approaching with guns drawn, where four occupants were suspected of just having committing armed robbery with gun).we acknowledge that the question here is close, and our resolution of it necessarily ""depends on the particular facts of [this] case.""  williams, 422 mass. at 118.  we are constrained to conclude that police conduct here was not ""commensurate with their suspicion.""  willis, 415 mass. at 820.  the stop of the defendant thus constituted an arrest.  because the commonwealth acknowledges that, at the time of the stop, there was no probable cause for an arrest, the defendant's motion to suppress should have been allowed.judgments reversed.verdicts set aside.",criminal,James F.

[802-804]in a proceeding on a care and protection petition, the judge did not err in approving the plan of the department of children and families (department) for guardianship of the child, where the department's failure to offer evidence to explain why the goal was changed from adoption to guardianship was not fatal, given the finding (amply supported by the record) that continued placement with the foster family was in the child's best interests. [804-805]","following a trial in the juvenile court, a judge found the mother unfit to parent her daughter xarina, terminated her parental rights, and approved the plan of the department of children and families (department).  on appeal, the mother argues thatpage 801in the circumstances of this case, it was error for the judge to terminate her parental rights when the father's rights were not terminated.she also claims it was error for the judge to approve the plan proposed by the department.  we affirm.1.  background.  xarina was born in september, 2006.  the mother and the father divorced in 2009.  following the divorce, the mother had legal and physical custody of xarina.  when xarina was approximately two years old, a report pursuant to g. l. c. 119, § 51a (51a report), was filed against the mother alleging neglect of the child.  thereafter, the father was awarded sole legal and physical custody of xarina.the father married his current wife, susan, in 2011, and they have two children together.  the department investigated numerous allegations against the family, including that the father had physically abused adam, susan's son from a prior relationship.  in october, 2014, the department received a 51a report after school staff noticed bruises on adam.  as part of its investigation, the department's social workers spoke with xarina, who, after some resistance, reported that she saw her father hitting adam and pushing him to the ground.  she also said that she did not want to get anyone into trouble and that the father told her that if she spoke to the department, she would be taken away.  she stated that she did not feel safe in the home and thought someone would ""kill her.""  in november, 2014, the department filed a petition pursuant to g. l. c. 119, § 24, alleging that xarina was in need of care and protection.  she was removed from the father's home and placed in the custody of the department that same day.a court investigation report filed in february, 2015, stated that the department had little to no contact with the mother, and her whereabouts were often unknown.  none of the mother's five children is in her custody.  she has a history of homelessness, substance use, domestic violence, and untreated mental health issues.by february, 2016, the mother had failed to meet with the department about xarina and had failed to complete any of the tasks in her service plan.  she failed to attend many of the juvenile court proceedings.  by contrast, the father was cooperating with the department and stipulated in february, 2016, that he was currentlypage 802unfit to care for xarina.  in march, 2016, the judge determined that the mother was unfit to parent xarina and awarded the department permanent custody of the child.  neither the mother's nor the father's parental rights were terminated at that time.in november, 2016, the department changed its goal for xarina from reunification to adoption and sought to terminate the mother's and the father's parental rights.  in april, 2017, on the day of trial, the department reported to the judge that after a lengthy discussion, the department had decided not to seek termination of the father's parental rights.  the department proceeded against the mother.  the mother, who was represented by counsel, did not attend the trial.  two department social workers testified.  the adoption social worker testified that the plan for adoption that the department had filed with the court would be changed to a plan with a goal of guardianship following a department permanency planning conference.see g. l. c. 119, § 29b.  the judge found that the mother was unfit and that it was in xarina's best interests to terminate the mother's parental rights, and he approved the department's plan.  this appeal followed.2.  discussion.  ""to terminate parental rights to a child and to dispense with parental consent to adoption, a judge must find by clear and convincing evidence, based on subsidiary findings proved by at least a fair preponderance of evidence, that the parent is unfit to care for the child and that termination is in the child's best interests.""  adoption of jacques,, 606 (2012).  in determining whether the best interests of a child are served by termination of parental rights, the judge ""shall consider the ability, capacity, and readiness of the child's parents . . . to assume parental responsibility"" (emphasis omitted).  adoption of elena,, 31 (2006), quoting from g. l. c. 210, § 3(c).

""unless shown to be clearly erroneous, we do not disturb the judge's findings, which are entitled to substantial deference.""  adoption of jacques, supra at 606-607.a.  the mother's unfitness.  the mother argues that it was error for the judge to terminate her parental rights, because her actionspage 803did not trigger the filing of the care and protection petition, and that termination was not necessary where the permanency goal for xarina changed from adoption to guardianship.  she argues that the department sought termination of her parental rights to ""punish her"" for failing to visit with xarina, and that the department's decision to leave the father's parental rights intact supports this argument.notably, the mother does not contend that the judge's finding that she is unfit is error.  she concedes that she has not completed any of the tasks in her service plan, that she has visited xarina only once during the pendency of the proceedings, and that she is not in a position to take custody of the child.  although ""[u]nfitness does not mandate a decree of termination,"" adoption of imelda, 72 mass. app. ct. 354, 360 (2008), and termination is not a prerequisite for guardianship, it is unfair to leave a child in limbo indefinitely.  see adoption of nancy,, 517-518 (2005).  indeed, as is the case here, termination is in the best interests of a child when it would bring some measure of stability to the child's life.  absent termination, the mother would have the right ""to receive notice of or to consent to any legal proceeding affecting the custody,, adoption or other disposition of the child"" (emphasis supplied).  g. l. c. 210, § 3(b).  see adoption of willow,, 647 n.11 (2001).  as such, even though the goal for xarina had changed from adoption to guardianship, termination of the mother's rights ""significantly eases the [child's] path to a stable placement.""  id. at 647.  once the mother's rights are terminated, ""transition[] to [a] permanent home[] will be expedited"" for the child, whether it be adoption or guardianship.  id. at 648.the mother's claim that the department sought termination of her parental rights in order to punish her, because the department did not also seek to terminate the father's parental rights, also fails.  as the mother acknowledged in her brief, it is well established that a judge may terminate the parental rights of one parent while keeping intact the parental rights of the other.  see id. at 644.  as the mother and father have not had a relationship for many years and do not constitute a single family for purposes of g. l. c. 119, § 1, see adoption of willow, supra, whether the father is unfit or whether his parental rights were also terminated were not material considerations in adjudicating the mother's parental rights.  the department's decision not to seek to terminate the father's rights finds support in the lengthy period of timepage 804during which xarina lived with him, his partial compliance with his service plan tasks, his consistent visits with xarina, and his bond with her.the judge's decision to sever the legal ties between the mother and xarina was based on his determination that the mother was unlikely to work with the department to resolve her mental health issues, to address her substance use, and to improve her parenting skills.  see adoption of nancy, 443 mass. at 516.  indeed, the judge made detailed findings, amply supported by the record, that the mother's failure to visit xarina, engage in any services, and work with the department or notify them of her whereabouts demonstrated ""ongoing serious parental neglect of [the child].""  he also properly considered the requisite factors under g. l. c. 210, § 3(c), and found that factors (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x), (xii), and (xiv) were applicable.  moreover, the judge explicitly assessed the mother's capacity to parent ""within the context of [the child's] particular needs,"" and determined that the mother ""lacks the capacity to meet [the child's] specialized needs.""  there was no error.b.  the department's plan.  the mother next argues that it was error for the judge to approve the department's plan for guardianship of xarina, as there was no rationale to explain why the department changed the goal from adoption to guardianship and why it served xarina's best interests.  in considering the issue of parental unfitness, ""the judge must consider the [guardianship] plan proposed by [the department] before terminating parental rights.""  adoption of dora, 52 mass. app. ct. 472, 474 (2001).  ""[t]he judge is required to consider and meaningfully evaluate plans put forward by the department and by the parents.""  adoption of cadence, 81 mass. app. ct. at 170.  the department's plan need not be ""fully developed,"" adoption of paula,, 722 n.7 (1995), but it must lend itself to substantive consideration.  see adoption of willow, 433 mass. at 652-653 (""the adoption plan need not be fully developed to support a termination order; it need only provide sufficient information about the prospective adoptive placement so that the judge may properly evaluate the suitability of the department's proposal"" [quotation omitted]).here, the mother did not set forth her own plan for xarina, and she was not required to do so.  however, she does not challenge xarina's placement with the current foster parents.  instead, the mother's only contention is that the judge did not adequately find that guardianship was in xarina's best interests.page 805although it would have been better practice for the department to offer evidence to explain why the goal was changed from adoption to guardianship, this is not fatal.  the controlling consideration is the welfare of the child.  see adoption of cadence, 81 mass. app ct. at 171.  the judge's finding that continued placement with the foster family is in xarina's best interests is amply supported by the record.she has been living with this family since november, 2014, and has thrived there.  her weight and hygiene have improved, she completes daily tasks without much prompting, and she is progressing academically.  xarina also sees herself in this home as she gets older.  the current foster parents are both employed, have a suitable home, and have a strong commitment to and bond with xarina.  ultimately, the judge found that xarina had made ""tremendous strides"" in her foster home.the department is not required to retry a parent's unfitness in the event the proposed plan for a child changes.  adoption of nancy, 443 mass. at 517.  indeed, g. l. c. 119, § 29b, provides multiple options for permanency plans for children and does not expressly require the department to choose one exclusively.  adoption of nancy, supra at 517 (""the statute . . . provides a greater range of permanent placement options for children than simply limiting placement to adoption . . ."").  in reviewing a trial judge's consideration of a plan, we will not disturb the decision absent an abuse of discretion or clear error of law.  see care & protection of yetta,, 696 (2014).  here, there was none.decree affirmed.",civil,None,affirm

[811-817] rubin, j., dissenting.at a criminal trial, the superior court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant's request for a mistrial based on the commonwealth's late disclosure of evidence (i.e., eighty-five crime scene photographs and an eighteen-page crime scene response report with diagrams showing the location of the weapon), where the evidence was neither exculpatory nor exceptionally probative to either party's case, the judge offered to exclude the evidence if the defendant so chose, the evidence did not change the blocking of the crime scene or depict the area as more complicated than described by the commonwealth's witnesses in a manner that weakened the commonwealth'spage 807case, and, in view of the four-day continuance the judge gave the defendant to digest the new evidence, the delayed disclosure could not be said to have forced the defense to change any tactics that had already been in place. [817-819]at a criminal trial, the prosecutor's remarks in her opening statement that the defendant did not handle rejection well and could not let things go were not improper, but rather were a proper outline of the general nature of the case and gave context to the stabbing of the victims [819-820]; nor was the prosecutor's comment as to the expected testimony of a witness who had not made an out-of-court identification improper, in that the comment was a fair inference from the anticipated evidence [820-821]; further, the prosecutor did not misstate the evidence in her closing argument by stating that certain witnesses gave statements identifying the defendant, in that her argument was properly based on the reasonable inferences from the evidence [821]; finally, even if the prosecutor's statement in closing argument concerning deoxyribonucleic acid evidence was improper, it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in that there was no objection to the statement, the commonwealth's case was particularly strong, and the judge instructed the jury on the limited purpose of closing arguments and, more importantly, that the commonwealth bore the burden of proof. [821-822]","after a jury trial, the defendant was convicted of three counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon and carrying a dangerous weapon.  after a separate jury trial, he was convicted of carrying a dangerous weapon as a second and subsequent offense.  on appeal, he claims that the judge abused his discretion by not dismissing a juror and by denying a motion for a mistrial.  the defendant also claims that the prosecutor's opening statement and closing argument were errors that created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  we affirm.1.  background.  on the night of june 6, 2014, off-duty state police trooper peter bien-aime; his wife, leslie bien-aime;and another couple, david lebrun and elizabeth almeida, went out for the night in boston.  sometime after midnight, the group went to venu (hereinafter, club), a night club located on warrenton street.page 808after getting drinks, peter and lebrun were making their way back to leslie and almeida, who were conversing when the defendant approached the women.  the defendant, a short, skinny, black male with very short hair, wished to dance with almeida; she had no interest.upon seeing the two women upset, lebrun and peter approached the defendant, who greeted them by throwing a drink at them; the cup hit peter in his face.  pushing ensued, which resulted in intervention by mercelino amaro, the club manager.  the defendant was escorted out of the club.outside the club, boston police officer stephen fabiano and detective kevin guy, who were working a detail in the theater district, saw the defendant being removed from the club.they saw him yell at someone in the doorway and try to reenter the club a few times before he and his friend walked away on warrenton street in the direction of stuart street.approximately thirty minutes later, the two couples left the club and began walking up warrenton street towards a parking lot where their car was parked.  while they walked, the group was approached by the defendant and the other man peter had seen earlier in the club.they asked the group in a sarcastic manner if they were ""the guys that were fighting, beating up those two people in [the club].""  the defendant began ""violently"" waving his hands around and stabbed lebrun in his lower back.  when almeida screamed ""what are you doing,"" the defendant grabbed her arm, spun her around, and stabbed her in the upper left back, next to her lungs, ribs, and spine.  almeida immediately fell to the ground, and leslie began screaming.  the defendant then swung at peter and stabbed him just below his belt, piercing his clothing.  when the defendant attempted to flee, peter tackled him.officer fabiano and detective guy saw the fight occurring from their position up the street.  they recognized both peter and the defendant, who was one of the men who had been removed from the club.  the officers separated peter and the defendant,page 809who had been rolling on the ground and fighting.  the defendant struggled to get away, but guy pinned him against a nearby parked bus.  amaro, who followed the police down the street, also recognized the group from the earlier drink-throwing incident.  as the defendant was pinned against the bus, amaro saw a knife fall to the ground between guy and the defendant, and amaro secured it by stepping over it (to block its use).after the fight, lebrun identified the defendant as the person who stabbed them, and the defendant was arrested.  peter also was arrested and transported to the police station where he was later released.2.  discussion.  a.  jury selection.  juror number (no.) twelve's fears and concerns.  the defendant claims that he was denied his right to an impartial jury because the judge abused his discretion when he declined to dismiss juror no. twelve, who expressed a concern about his ability to be impartial due to the stress of missing college classes.  we disagree.the sixth amendment to the united states constitution and art. 12 of the declaration of rights of the massachusetts constitution guarantee criminal defendants trial by an impartial jury.  see skilling v. united states, 561 u.s. 358, 377 (2010); commonwealth v. mccowen,, 494 (2010).  ""we afford a trial judge a large degree of discretion in the jury selection process.""  commonwealth v. vann long,, 803 (1995).  see g. l. c. 234a, § 39.  the judge is duty bound to question potential jurors to ferret out any possible bias, prejudice, partiality, or whether there exists a substantial risk that the potential juror may be influenced by factors extraneous to the evidence at trial.  commonwealth v. andrade,, 547 (2014).  when evaluating juror impartiality, it is sufficient for the judge to inquire whether potential jurors can set aside their own opinions, properly weigh the evidence, and follow the judge's instructions.  id. at 547-548.  see commonwealth v. perez,, 688-689 (2011).  ""[a] determination by the judge that a jury are impartial will not be overturned on appeal in the absence of a clear showing of abuse of discretion or that the finding was clearly erroneous.""  commonwealth v. andrade, supra at 548, quoting from commonwealth v. lopes,, 736 (2004).  see commonwealth v. ferguson,, 352-353 (1997) (determination of juror impartiality ""is essentially one of credibility""); commonwealth v. emerson,, 384 (1999) (""a finding that a juror is impartial willpage 810not be overturned on appeal unless the defendant makes a clear showing of abuse of discretion or that the finding was clearly erroneous"").the judge conducted the empanelment process and asked the prospective jurors questions along the lines prescribed by g. l. c. 234, § 28.during this process, the judge inquired whether juror no. twelve had raised his hand to any of the questions.  the juror indicated that he had done so in response to the judge's question regarding whether the length of the trial would be a burden.  the juror explained that he was a student at northeastern university (university) and that serving as a juror would ""significantly impact"" his course work.  the judge informed the juror that he would not excuse him for that reason, and that the university would support his service as a juror.  juror no. twelve agreed and had no other questions.  neither party exercised any form of challenge to the juror.at the end of the first day of trial, juror no. twelve sent the judge a note stating, ""i believe that the stress of missing school will result in an impartial [sic] decision on my part.  i am terrified that i will fail my classes and do not know if i can make a fair decision in the near future.""  the judge was understandably troubled by the note and questioned juror no. twelve at sidebar.  the judge explained that jury service by college students in the boston area was in no way unique and that it was a great opportunity to be given such a responsibility as a young adult.  he told the juror that many other students have had the same concerns and that the universities are required to make accommodations for jury service.  the juror understood, but he remained concerned about missing classes and having to make up the work.  the judge understood the juror's concerns, wanted him to be ""comfortable"" with his jury service, and instructed him to speak to university officials about what accommodations they would make for him and to report back to the judge the next day.  the juror agreed, noted that he had already contacted the registrar's office, and told the judge that he ""definitely want[ed] to participate in [his] civic duty,"" but remained concerned.  after reassuring the juror that the university would permit him to make up the work he missed, the juror agreed to do as the judge requested.the next morning, after the judge confirmed with juror no. twelve that the university would make accommodations for hispage 811jury service, the judge nevertheless inquired whether the juror could be fair to the defendant and give his attention to the judge's instructions and the evidence.  the juror responded, ""i would definitely do my best, but i can't promise anything.""  on further inquiry, the juror explained that he feared falling behind in his class work, but then indicated that he would ""man up"" and do his best.at the conclusion of the colloquy, the judge told the juror he was ""a perfect candidate"" to make sure the right result was reached, to which the juror responded, ""i simply don't know.""  the judge decided to continue with the trial and to keep the juror seated.  defense counsel requested that the juror be struck for cause.  the judge explained that he would ""keep [him] as a work in progress, and assured counsel that he would not keep the juror for deliberation if ""he's impaired.""""as a general principle, it is an abuse of discretion to empanel a juror who will not state unequivocally that he or she will be impartial.""  commonwealth v. colton,, 17 (2017).  however, evaluating a juror's use of seemingly equivocal language to make that determination lies within the judge's discretion.  here, in response to the judge's questions, the juror said he would do his ""best"" but could not ""promise anything.""  the judge reasonably could have concluded that these responses merely reflected the juror's habits of speech, contrast commonwealth v. vann long, 419 mass. at 804 & n.5 (""statements that [the juror] 'would hope' he could be fair to the cambodian defendant were not habits of speech, but indications of ethnic bias""), or were, at bottom, ""not determinative of the juror's ability to be impartial.""  commonwealth v. jaime j.,, 274 (2002).  see commonwealth v. prunty,, 302 (2012) (no abuse of discretion to retain african-american juror who stated he ""would be able to do my best"" to not let defendant's racial prejudice affect juror's ability to be impartial); commonwealth v. colton, supra (no abuse of discretion to empanel juror who, when asked if she could be fair to both sides, responded, ""yes, i think so,"" which ""could be viewed as unequivocal"").see also commonwealth v. wilborne,, 254 (1981) (no abuse ofpage 812discretion in empanelling juror who stated that she ""did not think"" that her friend's experience as rape victim would affect juror's ability to be impartial); commonwealth v. ascolillo,, 459 (1989) (no abuse of discretion in empanelling juror whose final answer was, ""no, i don't think so,"" to judge's inquiry whether juror's experience as police officer and assault victim would make him partial).  also, that juror no. twelve expressed some uncertainty with the judge's assessment of the juror being a perfect candidate for jury service did not require the judge to find that uncertainty to be an indicator of partiality any more than humility.unlike this court's review of the cold record, the judge was uniquely situated to measure juror no. twelve's demeanor and credibility.  although early on in the judge's inquiry, the juror stated his concern about his ability to be ""impartial,"" the judge did not end the matter there.  instead, he conducted a careful and thorough examination of the matter, after which the judge was in a better position to evaluate and to credit (or discredit) the motivation and the effect of the juror's stated concerns.  compare commonwealth v. auguste,, 57 (1992) (finding abuse of discretion where judge's inquiry ""avoided the very issue"" of juror's ability to be impartial and coerced juror's responses).  our review of the record supports the judge's apparent determination that the juror's ""doubts about his . . . own impartiality [were] unfounded,"" id. at 58, and were not an indicator of partiality at all.  while the juror classified his stress and concern about falling behind in his class work under the label of partiality, the judge was not required to credit what the juror reported.  see commonwealth v. ferguson, 425 mass. at 352-353.  however, even if the judge did credit the juror's scholastic concerns, those concerns are not a basis to discharge a juror.  as we held in commonwealth v. campbell,, 483-484 (2001), ""a juror's complaints about the length of the proceedings, or expressions of frustration about having to serve as a juror, do not necessarily reflect the juror's inability to perform his or her function as an impartial trier of fact and, therefore, it is properlypage 813within the trial judge's discretion to refuse to discharge such a juror.""  see commonwealth v. mabey,, 99 (1937) (no indication that jury were unable or unwilling to give full and careful consideration to evidence in spite of foreperson's statements that jury were beginning to ""get kind of jumpy"" and that ""[w]e [the jury] are just dying to get out"").indeed, at its core, this juror's concerns centered on his frustration about the inconvenience inherent in performing jury service.  it did not reflect partiality or bias such that retaining him constituted reversible error.  see commonwealth v. campbell, supra at 483, citing commonwealth v. vann long, supra at 804 & n.5.  instead, juror no. twelve's concern about missing his classes was a ""run-of-the mill frustration[] by an exasperated juror about the judicial process,"" which is ""to be expected.""  commonwealth v. campbell, supra at 484.  notably, after the judge's thorough colloquy, the juror never again raised his concerns regarding his stress from the length of the trial and its impact on his course load.  indeed, in his written findings,the judge wrote that when juror no. twelve returned to the trial (after having conferred with the university), the juror was ""satisfied that he could continue with his service.  the [judge] found that there was no reason to discharge him.""  fairly read, the judge concluded that the juror could perform his function impartially.  given these findings, the judge's decision to retain the juror was not an abuse of discretion where the judge could properly conclude that he had allayed the juror's school work concerns so that the juror could render an impartial verdict based on the evidence.  see commonwealth v. ferguson, supra; commonwealth v. colton, 477 mass. at 16-17.  in other words, even though it might have been our choice in the first instance to have excused this juror, it falls outside our appellate office to substitute our judgment for the judge, who conducted the colloquies, assessed the juror's demeanor, and subsequently credited the juror's statements as being unequivocal.see commonwealth v. ferguson, supra at 352-354.  the decision the judge made was neither a ""clear error of judgment,""page 814nor did his ""decision fall[] outside the range of reasonable alternatives.""  l.l. v. commonwealth,, 185 n.27 (2014) (citation omitted).juror no. twelve's opinion of the law.  the defendant also claims that juror no. twelve should have been dismissed after he spoke of jury nullification and expressed his disagreement with a point of law from the judge's instructions.  we disagree.after the judge completed his instructions to the jury, but before deliberations began, juror no. twelve sent a note to the judge stating, ""i believe i may know information that would affect my ability to judge the case based solely on the information received in the trial.""  when questioned by the judge, the juror clarified that he had not been exposed to extraneous evidence, but that he had ""heard about how the jury actually has more power than [the judge] expressed, that [the jury] can judge not only based on just information, but whether they believe the law is fair, or their personal convictions . . . to judge guilty or not guilty.""  the judge explained that this was known as jury nullification, and that it was not permitted.  the judge further explained that although he cannot instruct the juror on how to deliberate, he told the juror that the jury determine what the facts are, and that the jury must accept the judge's statement of the law regardless of the jury's agreement with it.  the judge queried whether juror no. twelve had any question regarding his ability ""to take the law as i gave it to you, and apply it to the facts as you and [the] other jurors find them?""  the juror responded, ""i don't think so.""  sensing some hesitancy, the judge again explained the two different roles performed by the judge and the jury, and reiterated his instructions on the elements of the charged offenses.although agreeing with much of what the judge explained, juror no. twelve stated that he did not believe it should be unlawful to possess a small knife.  the judge further explained that it was not just that the knife's blade must be more than one-and-one-half inches, but that the knife must also have a case that enables the knife to be drawn in a locked position.  see g. l. c. 269, § 10(b).  after this explanation, the judge asked the juror if he had any problem applying that law, to which the juror said, ""i guess not.""  not satisfied with the juror's response, and sensingpage 815that the juror may nevertheless disagree with the law, the judge further instructed that the juror had to apply the law even if he disagreed with it.  the juror responded that he ""thought that the jury had the power to choose whatever way to --,"" whereupon the judge interrupted and said, ""i just told you it doesn't.""  the juror said, ""okay.""the judge continued to explain the importance of the jury understanding their obligations and that there should not be any hesitancy.the judge then asked if the juror was able to apply the law to the elements as the judge explained, and juror replied, ""yes.""  the judge then painstakingly went through his other ""major"" jury instructions to ascertain whether the juror had any problem applying those instructions, and juror said he had no problem.  finally, the judge asked, in reference to jury nullification, whether the juror was able to forget about ""what other people have told [him].""  the juror agreed that he could, and that he could be fair and honest to his oath.  when the judge asked if the juror was ""all set,"" the juror replied that he was and thanked the judge for speaking with him.  the judge thanked the juror and shared his appreciation for the juror having the courage to speak up and resolve his concerns.at the close of this colloquy, defense counsel renewed his request that the juror be discharged, and the prosecutor joined the request.  in response, the judge explained to both counsel how the juror's concerns were resolved, that the juror would put aside his personal beliefs, would not engage in jury nullification, and was able to serve dispassionately with full attention to the case.  the judge explained that he ""went to great pains to give [the juror the] security of being able to be a juror as well as a student, . . . and [the judge did not] find any reason to discharge [the juror] afterpage 816the colloquy that [they] engaged in.""  counsels' objections were noted.contrary to the defendant's claim, the juror did not continually express his inability to be impartial and to apply the law as given.  as the juror admitted, he was not exposed to any extraneous information.  instead, and apparently, the juror had been apprised of the concept of jury nullification.  the judge properly explained that jury nullification was not permitted and would be a violation of his oath to apply the law as given.  see commonwealth v. kirwan,, 319 (2007) (""jury nullification is inconsistent with a jury's duty to return a guilty verdict of the highest crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt"").  see also commonwealth v. paulding,, 9 (2002) (jury may not ""exercise clemency""; their verdict may not be ""contrary to the facts or the law of the case,"" and that verdict may not be an effort ""to control the punishment which they think should be imposed on the defendant for his crime""), quoting from commonwealth v. dickerson,, 812 (1977) (quirico, j., concurring).  cf. art. 30 of the massachusetts declaration of rights (commonwealth is ""a government of laws and not of men"").when juror no. twelve told the judge that he did not agree with the law regarding the knife as a dangerous weapon, the judge first discussed the issue with the juror and clarified what the law was.  after this explanation, the judge asked the juror if he had any problem applying that law, to which the juror said, ""i guess not.""  not satisfied, the judge asked additional questions, which culminated in the juror agreeing that he would be able to apply the law to the elements as the judge explained.  as an added measure of caution, the judge returned to other major portions of his instructions to ascertain the juror's proper understanding of his role.contrary to the defendant's claim, the judge addressed the juror's ""initial uncertainty competently"" by ""ask[ing] probing questions designed to clarify the juror's position.""  commonwealth v. jaime j., 56 mass. app. ct. at 275.  based on the juror's response that he could apply the law as instructed, the judge did not abuse his discretion in crediting the juror's response and declining to discharge the juror.  ""we defer to the judge's conclusion not to excuse this juror, because he had the opportunity to observe [the juror's] demeanor while he questioned [the juror] atpage 817some length, and because [the juror's] answers to his probing questions allayed any concerns he might have had.""  commonwealth v. seabrooks,, 443-444 (2001).the judge was within his discretion to decline to dismiss juror no. twelve.b.  late disclosed discovery.  after the second day of trial, the commonwealth disclosed eighty-five crime scene photographs and an eighteen-page crime scene response report with diagrams showing the location of the knife.  in response, the defendant requested a mistrial on the ground that the prejudice to the defense was too great to overcome because defense counsel would have altered his trial strategy and tactics if the evidence had been timely disclosed.  the judge denied the motion.on appeal, the defendant claims that the judge abused his discretion by denying the request for a mistrial because the late disclosure of the evidence compromised his prepared defense, which he already had been pursuing in his opening statement and through cross-examination of witnesses who already had been dismissed.  we disagree.""we review the denial of a motion for a mistrial for abuse of discretion.""  commonwealth v. martinez,, 197 (2017), citing commonwealth v. lao,, 19 (2011).  ""the trial judge is in the best position to assess any potential prejudice and, where possible, to tailor an appropriate remedy short of declaring a mistrial.""  commonwealth v. martinez, supra.  see commonwealth v. amran,, 360 (2015).  ""[t]he burden of demonstrating an abuse of discretion is a heavy one.""  commonwealth v. medeiros,, 351 (1985).the question, when dealing with the delayed disclosure ofpage 818exculpatory or inculpatory evidence,is ""whether, given a timely disclosure, the defense would have been able to prepare and present its case in such a manner as to create a reasonable doubt that would not otherwise have existed.""  commonwealth v. baldwin,, 175 (1982), quoting from commonwealth v. wilson,, 114 (1980).""absent a showing of bad faith, we consider the primary issue of prejudice.  in measuring prejudice, 'it is the consequences of the delay that matter, not the likely impact of the nondisclosed evidence, and we ask whether the prosecution's disclosure was sufficiently timely to allow the defendant ""to make effective use of the evidence in preparing and presenting his case.""'""commonwealth v. stote,, 23 (2000), quoting from commonwealth v. wilson, supra.  see commonwealth v. nolin,, 224 (2007).after hearing arguments on the motion for a mistrial, the judge took the matter under advisement and gave the defendant four days to digest the new evidence and to determine how he would proceed.the judge also ordered a copy of the transcript of defense counsel's opening statement so the judge could determine whether counsel had made any promises he could no longer keep in light of the new evidence.  when the trial resumed, the judge denied the request for a mistrial.  he held that counsel had made no promise he could not keep, and the judge ordered the commonwealth to make the witnesses who had already testified available in the event that the defendant wished to recall them.there was no abuse of discretion for several reasons.  as the judge noted, the photographs and the diagrams in the eighteen-page report were neither exculpatory nor exceptionally probative to either party's case.  the judge even offered to exclude the evidence, if the defendant so chose.  also, as the judge noted, although there were eighty-five crime scene photographs, theypage 819appeared to him to be cumulative and repetitive of other crime scene evidence; all were taken in the same general areas.there is no merit to the defendant's claim that the late disclosed evidence changed the blocking of the crime scene.  nor did the new evidence depict the area as more ""complicated"" than described by the commonwealth's witnesses in a manner that weakened the commonwealth's case.  in fact, the photographs and the diagrams corroborated the witnesses' testimony that detective guy pulled the defendant and peter away from each other and pinned the defendant up against a parked bus, and that the knife fell to the ground near the bus during the struggle between detective guy, the defendant, and peter.in view of the continuance, the delayed disclosure cannot be said to have forced the defense to change any tactics that already had been in place.  the defense was that the police investigation was inadequate.  see commonwealth v. bowden,, 485-486 (1980).  the gravamen of the defense was that the police conducted a subpar investigation because they were biased and had chosen sides because one of the victims was an off-duty state trooper.  the crime scene photographs and the diagrams would have added little to this argument.  also, it was understood by all parties that the commonwealth would not introduce the photographs or any portion of the crime scene report.  given the remedies applied and the lack of prejudice to the defendant, there was no error or abuse of discretion in the denial of the request for a mistrial.  see commonwealth v. costello,, 399-400 (1984); commonwealth v. hamilton,, 70-71 (1997).c.  prosecutor's opening statement and closing argument.  finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor made a series of improper remarks during her opening statement and closing argument that created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  we disagree.i. opening statement.  ""the proper function of an opening is to outline in a general way the nature of the case which the counsel expects to be able to prove or support by evidence.""  commonwealth v. staines,, 535 (2004) (citation omitted).  see commonwealth v. lodge,, 417 (2016).  here, the defendant takes issue with the prosecutor's statement that ""[w]e are here today because the defendant, mr. njisane chambers, doesn't handle rejection well.  he can't let things go.""  the prosecutor repeated this theme in other portions of herpage 820opening statement.contrary to the defendant's claim, when viewed in light of the entire opening, these statements do not amount to improper argument, but rather were a proper outline of the general nature of the case and gave context to the defendant's stabbing of the victims.  see commonwealth v. tarjick,, 381 (2015) (prosecutor may ""place in context the evidence that the commonwealth reasonably expected to produce at trial"").  the prosecutor's statements were made in the context of the anticipated evidence regarding almeida's rejection of the defendant's advances in the club and the defendant's reaction to that rejection by throwing a drink as well as by attacking the group with a knife after they left the club.  there was no error, and thus no risk that justice miscarried.the defendant also finds impropriety in the prosecutor's statement that james feeney, who was in a band tour bus parked on warrenton street at the time of the stabbing, would testify ""that it was the defendant, mr. chambers, [who] stabbed these three individuals in the street . . . and it was the defendant and the defendant alone who is responsible for these actions.""  this the defendant claims was improper because feeney did not make an out-of-court identification.  we disagree.in general, ""a prosecutor in a criminal action may state anything in [her] opening argument that [she] expects to be able to prove by evidence. . . .  this general rule also permits the prosecutor to state those facts which would have to be proved by inferences.""  commonwealth v. smith,, 175 (2003).  here, feeney testified that he saw a smaller black male push a woman to the ground and attempt to run away before being tackled to the ground by a tall, muscular black male, and that the bigger male was on top of the smaller male when the police arrived.  also, both officer fabiano and detective guy testified that peter was pinning the defendant down when they arrived.  based on the descriptions of the scene and the defendant, the prosecutor's statement was a fair inference from the evidence.  to the extent there was any misstep, the judge instructed the jury that opening statements are not intended to persuade them, but only to offer an outline of what the expected evidence will be.  seepage 821commonwealth v. simpson,, 584 (2001).ii. closing argument.  finally, the defendant claims that the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence and engaged in burden shifting.  the defendant did not object to the prosecutor's closing argument and, therefore, we review for error and, if any, whether it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. coutu,, 697 (2015).the defendant claims that the prosecutor misstated the evidence when she argued that ""not only [peter], but all of the victims gave statements.  mercelino amaro gave statements.  jim feeney, never met these people in his life, he gave a statement.  and who did they all say was responsible?  the defendant.""  the defendant offers, however, that this was false because only peter and lebrun identified the defendant.  we disagree.  the argument was properly based on the reasonable inferences from the evidence.  amaro, feeney, and almeida each described the defendant by his physical appearance in a consistent manner, i.e., that he was a short, slim, black male with short hair.  this physical description of the assailant matched the defendant, who peter and lebrun identified as the same person from the earlier altercation in the club.  although almeida, feeney, and amaro, did not directly make out-of-court or in-court identifications of the defendant, the prosecutor properly suggested, based on the circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, that the person they described as the perpetrator was the defendant.  see commonwealth v. deane,, 55-56 (2010) (""a prosecutor is entitled to argue the evidence and fair inferences to be drawn therefrom"" [quotation omitted]).  there was no error and, thus, no risk that justice miscarried.the defendant also claims that the prosecutor engaged in impermissible burden shifting when she argued, regarding the deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) evidence:  ""the dna doesn't tell us why, and defense counsel is only focusing on the police, the police failures, the dna, because that's all he has to hang his hat on, because he has no reasonable explanation, no rational explanation for the actions of the defendant.""  this, the defendant argues, signaled to the jury that the defendant had an affirmative duty to bring forth evidence of innocence.however, as the commonwealth maintains, the argument should be understood to be a comment on the weakness of the defendant's case and the trial tactic of highlighting the prosecution's failure to test the blood on the knife for dna.  seepage 822commonwealth v. feroli,, 409 (1990); commonwealth v. buzzell,, 367-368 (2001).  in fact, in the defendant's closing, in support of his bowden defense, counsel highlighted that because the knife had not been tested for dna, it was unknown whether the knife had a mixture of dna on it or whether it may have had only the defendant's dna on it, and how the latter would have damaged the commonwealth's case.  the prosecutor was entitled to ""comment on the trial tactics of the defence,"" commonwealth v. grimshaw,, 507 (1992), and to respond to the defendant's closing argument.  see commonwealth v. smith,, 7 (1989).  see also commonwealth v. feroli, supra (""a prosecutor is entitled to emphasize the strong points of the commonwealth's case and the weaknesses of the defendant's case, even though he may, in so doing, prompt some collateral or passing reflection on the fact that the defendant declined to testify""); commonwealth v. cohen,, 388 (1992) (""it is . . . not improper for a prosecutor to comment on a defendant's attempt to confuse or distract the jury by diverting their attention from the strong evidence of the defendant's guilt"").however, even if the prosecutor's argument was improper, we conclude that it did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  several components of the case lead to this conclusion.  see commonwealth v. randolph,, 297 (2002).  first, there was no objection to the statements, which lends credence to the belief that they did not create an unfair or prejudicial impact.  see commonwealth v. lyons,, 471 (1998).  second, the commonwealth's case was particularly strong.  the defendant was identified and detained at the scene of the stabbing after his attack on the victims with whom he had earlier fought inside the club.  third, the judge instructed the jury on the limited purpose of closing arguments and, more importantly, that the commonwealth bore the burden of proof and that ""the defendant in a criminal case never has any duty or obligation to testify or to come forward with any evidence.""judgments affirmed.this is a straightforward case.  both the public and the defendant are entitled to fair and impartial jurors,page 823and the requirement of fairness and impartiality includes the ability to attend to and fairly to consider the evidence and the judge's instructions.  see commonwealth v. sleeper,, 589 (2002) (""both the commonwealth and the defendant are entitled to an attentive jury"").  therefore, as the supreme judicial court reminded us during the pendency of this very appeal, ""as a general principle, it is an abuse of discretion to empanel a juror who will not state unequivocally that he or she will be impartial.""  commonwealth v. colton,, 17 (2017).juror number (no.) twelve would not, and did not, make any such statement.  indeed, the majority does not attempt to identify a single statement of the juror in which he said he could be fair and impartial.  the very closest the juror came to that was to say, ""i would definitely do my best, but i can't promise anything,"" which, as a matter of law, does not amount to the required unequivocal statement.  the supreme judicial court has already held that a juror's statement that ""he would 'do [his] best'"" is not an ""unequivocal[] state[ment] that [the juror] would be impartial,"" and that it does not suffice to permit a juror to sit whose impartiality is in question.  commonwealth v. vann long,, 804 (1995).  juror no. twelve's ""i can't promise anything"" addendum only weakens his statement.in fact, far from unequivocally stating that he would be fair and impartial, juror no. twelve stated unequivocally that he believed that he could not be fair and impartial in this matter, and never subsequently stated unequivocally that he could or would be fair or impartial or, indeed, that he could listen and attend to the evidence and the instructions.  he never even said that he thought he could.  it was, therefore, an abuse of discretion to seat him.during trial, both parties moved that he be discharged because of his statements.  though the commonwealth here attempts to defend its favorable verdict, in the trial court it went so far as to seek emergency interlocutory relief before the single justice of the supreme judicial court from the refusal of the trial judge to discharge juror no. twelve.the law is clear that no one in this commonwealth should be required to stand trial before a juror like this who cannot unequivocally say he will fairly and impartially judge the case before him.  rather than identifying any purportedly unequivocal statement by the juror, the majority first suggests -- incorrectly in light of vann long -- that a judge has discretion to find a juror who says he cannot be fair or impartial nonetheless can be.  morepage 824fundamentally though, and more troubling because the judge never made any such finding about this juror, the majority, in order to affirm the judgments, announces without support that where a juror cannot be fair and impartial because of ""frustration about the inconvenience inherent in performing jury service,"" he or she may nonetheless be seated.  ante at 813.but there are no kinds of unfairness or partiality that are tolerable in a juror.  because i think the judgments therefore should be reversed, i must respectfully dissent.a.  the first and second days of trial.  1.  facts.  at the end of the first day of trial, juror no. twelve, an undergraduate student only six weeks into his freshman year at northeastern university (university), sent the judge a note that said, ""i believe that the stress of missing school will result in an impartial [sic] decision on my part.  i am terrified that i will fail my classes and do not know if i can make a fair decision in the near future.""  this was a statement that juror no. twelve did not believe that he could be fair and impartial.at a sidebar conference, the judge encouraged the juror, and told him that the university would make accommodations for jury service.  the judge instructed the juror to speak to university officials about what accommodations they would make for him, and to report back.  the next morning, in response to questions from the judge that reflected the judge's clear understanding of the issue, ""are you going to be able to give me attention, are you going to be able to be fair to this guy and this woman in their respective cases?  are you going to be able to listen attentively to my instructions?  are you going to be able to listen to the evidence?"" juror no. twelve said only, ""i would definitely do my best, but i can't promise anything.""the judge did not respect that answer but said, among other things, ""people have to step up to the plate.""  the juror responded, ""i agree that you're telling me to man up, and i will.""the judge, presumably recognizing the impropriety of shaming the juror into giving what the juror perceived as the judge's desired response, immediately said, ""i'm not saying man up.  i didn't say that.""  see commonwealth v. auguste,, 58 (1992) (judge may probe impartiality with questions, but may not seat juror on basis of ""answers suggested or, in fact, required by the questions. . . .  jurors should not be coerced into a particular response"").  the judge then told juror no. twelve, ""[y]ou're almost a perfect candidate for being able to use your analyticalpage 825skills to be able to listen to the evidence and . . . factor in . . . where the evidence lead[s] you to . . . .  you're a perfect candidate to be able to help out the commonwealth and the defendant to make sure that their result is reached.""  the juror responded, ""i simply don't know.""the defendant moved to discharge the juror, and his motion was denied.  although the commonwealth did not move at this point to discharge the juror, it did at the end of trial in part ""based on what he said from day 1 that he couldn't be impartial after the opening statements and hearing from the first witness.""  indeed, the commonwealth sought emergency interlocutory relief in the supreme judicial court from the order denying this motion.2.  analysis.  ""as a general principle, it is an abuse of discretion to empanel a juror who will not state unequivocally that he or she will be impartial.""  colton, 477 mass. at 17.  as these facts describe, juror no. twelve stated unequivocally that he believed that the stress of missing school would render him partial, and that terror at the prospect of failing his classes would compromise his ability to be fair.  in response to the judge's questions, this juror would not state unequivocally that he could be fair or impartial or that he could be attentive and listen to the evidence and the judge's instructions.  he did not even say that he thought he could.  his strongest statement, ""i would definitely do my best, but i can't promise anything,"" is inadequate.  in vann long, 419 mass. at 804, the supreme judicial court held that as a matter of law, ""[i will] do [my] best"" is not the requisite ""unequivocal[] state[ment] that [the juror] would be impartial.""  consequently, it cannot suffice to permit a juror to sit whose impartiality is in question.  ibid.  see commonwealth v. prunty,, 312 (2012).  the cases put forward by the majority in which no abuse of discretion was found in seating a juror who put forth some version of ""i think i could,"" are therefore irrelevant.  ante at 811-812.nor is prunty, the first case cited in the majority list, ante at 811, which the majority describes as finding ""no abuse of discretion to retain african-american juror who stated he 'would be able to do my best' to not let defendant's racial prejudice affect juror's ability to be impartial,"" of any relevance here.  as the court there explained, prunty did not alter the rule articulated in vann long that a statement that ""i will do my best"" is an insufficiently unequivocal statement of an ability to be fair and impartial.  prunty, supra at 311-312.  the statement in prunty was made by an african-american juror who had already expressed unequivocallypage 826that he could be impartial and with respect to whom there was no reason to question whether he could be fair and impartial.  ibid.  the juror made the statement when called back for further voir dire after defense counsel, whose client had made several highly offensive racist comments that were expected to be introduced at trial, attempted to utilize a peremptory challenge to strike the juror and the judge concluded that a prima facie showing had been made that it was based on the juror's race.  ibid.  defense counsel then alleged without any basis that his client's comments ""certainly are going to perhaps get under the skin of somebody who might be a little bit more sensitive to that issue, particularly where that is their descent.""  id. at 300.  there was no evidence that the juror harbored any racial prejudice and, as the court explained, the rule of vann long was not applicable in that circumstance because, since ""no . . . bias was apparent, . . . an unequivocal response was not necessary to rehabilitate the juror's impartiality.""  id. at 312.  by contrast, of course, it is applicable here, where there was reason to believe the juror could not stand indifferent based on the juror's explicit statement that he could not be fair or impartial.consistent with case law, when the defendant moved at the end of the colloquy for the juror's discharge he should have been excused for cause.  that should have been the end of this case.  no one would want this juror sitting on his or her own case, and the defendant was not required to have him sitting on his.in support of its conclusion to the contrary, the majority's most fundamental conclusion is that the juror's concerns ""centered on his frustration about the inconvenience inherent in performing jury service.  it did not reflect partiality or bias such that retaining him constituted reversible error.""  ante at 813.  thus even if the judge ""credited"" the juror's statement that his ""scholastic concerns"" made it impossible for him to be fair and impartial, this was ""not a basis to discharge [the] juror.""  ante at 812.this is meritless.  the law is clear that jurors must fairly, impartially, and attentively consider the evidence before them and the judge's instructions.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. dickerson,, 794 (1977) (""only jurors who will fairly and attentively consider the evidence before them"" may be seated).  the majority concedes as much.  see ante at 809 (""when evaluating juror impartiality,"" judges must among other things inquire whether potential jurors can ""properly weigh the evidence, and follow the judge's instructions"").  that juror no. twelve's inabilitypage 827to fairly and impartially attend to the evidence and the judge's instructions arose from the burdens the juror concluded were put on his studies by jury service obviously does not render his service proper.to the extent the majority by this language means otherwise, i.e., that there are some jurors who cannot be fair or impartial who may nonetheless sit, the case they cite of course does not support that proposition.  commonwealth v. campbell,(2001), rather, held correctly that ""[a] juror's complaints about the length of the proceedings, or expressions of frustration about having to serve as a juror, do not necessarily reflect the juror's inability to perform his or her function as an impartial trier of fact.""  id. at 483-484.  the court there made clear that, unlike in the instant case, ""[t]here was no indication that the juror's complaints . . . reflected an inability to perform his function as an impartial trier of fact.""  id. at 484.by contrast, in this case that inability is precisely what the juror asserted.  the juror's statements were not merely understandable complaints or expressions of frustration, something that, the majority tells us, need not be taken ""as an indicator of partiality.""  ante at note 6.  they were actual statements by a juror who believed that he could not be fair and impartial.  as the rule requiring an unequivocal statement from a juror that he or she will be fair and impartial makes clear, there is no variety of unfairness or partiality that is tolerable in a juror, and holding otherwise, as the majority appears to do here, contravenes centuries of precedent to the contrary:  ""[w]here there is abundant latitude for selection [of jurors,] none should sit who are notimpartial.  this is equally demanded by the general principles of the common law, (hesketh v. braddock, 3 burr. 1856,) and by those of our own constitution, requiring all judges to be as free, impartial and independent as the lot of humanity will admit.  declaration of rights, art. 29.""  (emphasis supplied.)  davis v. allen, 11 pick. 466, 467-468 (1831) (shaw, c.j., for a unanimous court).if instead the majority means only to say that the juror was, in fact, merely frustrated, and did not actually mean that he could not be fair and impartial, such a finding of fact -- one never made by the trial judge (notwithstanding the majority's suggestions), and which cannot be made properly by an appellate court on appeal -- is foreclosed in this case by the case law that allows a finding that a juror will be fair and impartial only where a jurorpage 828states unequivocally that he or she will be impartial.put another way, the law mandates a particular method for determining whether jurors can be fair and impartial, a method designed to make sure no unfair or partial juror sits:  the judge is required to ask them if they can be, and to take them at their word.  this is precisely why, ""[a]s a general principle, it is an abuse of discretion to empanel a juror who will not state unequivocally that he or she will be impartial.""  colton, 477 mass. at 17.the majority also holds that ""the judge could properly conclude that he had allayed the juror's school work concerns,"" ante at 813, without any citation to the record of what the juror actually said.  here is what the juror said:  after the juror confirmed that he had contacted university officials and that they had told him that they would ""work with [him],"" the judge asked, ""are you going to be able to be fair to this guy and this woman in their respective cases?  are you going to be able to listen attentively to my instructions?  are you going to be able to listen to the evidence?""  the juror responded, ""i would definitely do my best, but i can't promise anything,"" words that, as described supra, as a matter of law, cannot suffice to show that a juror whose impartiality is in question can stand fair and impartial.  see vann long, 419 mass. at 804.concluding that the juror's response meant that the juror's concernspage 829were not allayed -- which is what the words mean -- the judge immediately asked him what would ""interfere with"" his ability to exercise these three essential functions, and the juror responded, ""just fear of, just completely falling behind and failing my classes and just all the stress of everything.""  the judge responded, ""but i thought that the [university] was going to give you a little bit of an antidote,"" (emphasis supplied).  the juror then agreed with the judge that what the school would give him was not enough:  ""they will give a little more time, but that still means doing double the work in the same amount of time.""  the only other statements the juror made on the subject were, ""i agree that you're telling me to man up, and i will,"" which the judge told the juror was somehow a misinterpretation of what he (the judge) had said, and, ""i simply don't know,"" in response to the suggestion that he would be ""a perfect candidate"" to listen to the evidence and to deliberate on the case.  not one of the juror's statements even hints at the possibility that the judge had allayed his concerns.the other reasons given by the majority for refusing to take the juror at his word are insubstantial.  stating that he could not be fair and impartial could not have been a ""habit[] of speech"" that did not mean that the juror could not be fair and impartial.  see ante at 811.  indeed, the case in which the ""habit[] of speech"" language appears was one in which the court concluded that a juror who said he ""would really hope"" that he could be fair was not utilizing a mere habit of speech, but was asserting that he could not assure the judge that he could be impartial.  vann long, supra.  today is the first time either of our appellate courts has held that the words of someone who did not unequivocally state that he could be fair and impartial might merely have been a habit of speech.  yet no halfway competent english speaker would habitually use the phrases, ""i believe that the stress of missing school will result in [a partial] decision on my part,"" ""i am terrified that i will fail my classes and do not know if i can make a fair decision in the future,"" or ""i can't promise anything,"" with respect to fairness to the parties or ability to listen to the evidence or the instructions, to mean, ""i can be fair and impartial.""nor, of course, is it particularly impressive -- though the majority finds it ""notabl[e],"" ante at 813 -- that the juror ""never again raised his concerns,"" when he had already twice done so only to be told by the presiding judge, on the bench and in a robe, to ""step up to the plate.""  and while, doubtless, ""the judge waspage 830uniquely situated to measure juror no. twelve's demeanor and credibility,"" ante at 812, the judge never suggested that juror no. twelve was not credible or that his concerns should not be taken at face value.  because the juror would not state unequivocally that he would be fair and impartial, indeed because he would not even say that he thought he could be -- even as he agreed to sit because the judge told him to ""step up to the plate"" -- there is no basis in the record for a finding that he would.  and no amount of meaningful gazing by a judicial officer into this juror's eyes could render his statements unequivocal expressions of an ability to be fair and impartial.at the end of the day, there is not a single statement in the record, and the majority does not purport to point to one, in which juror no. twelve in fact said that he could be fair and impartial.  this is all that is needed to decide the case and on this basis alone i would reverse.but of course there is on this record much more.  because after the jury had been instructed, but before deliberations began, this selfsame juror sent another note to the judge, this one stating, ""i believe i may know information that would affect my ability to judge the case based solely on the information received in the trial.""b.  after the jury were instructed.  1.  facts.  called to sidebar after sending the note just described, juror no. twelve said, ""i heard about how the jury actually has more power than you expressed, that they can judge not only based on just information, but whether they believe the law is fair, or their personal convictions . . . to judge guilty or not guilty.""the judge explained that what the juror had heard about was jury nullification.  the judge said, ""that is not permitted.  that is definitely not permitted . . . .""  nonetheless, the juror still hesitated when the judge asked, ""is there any question of your ability to be able to take the law as i gave it to you, and apply it to the facts as you and your other jurors find them?""the judge decided therefore to go through the law on which the entire jury had been instructed, element by element, asking this one juror whether he had any difficulty understanding that law and applying it to the facts as he found them.  when the judge reached the point of explaining the elements of possession of a weapon, and in particular that knives with certain kinds of casements, when one-and-one-half-inches in length or longer, are defined as dangerous weapons, he asked, ""do you have any problem with takingpage 831the law as i give it to you, the statute that i gave you, and applying it to the facts as you might find them?"" and juror no. twelve said, ""i don't believe that the law should be that a knife of that size should be a dangerous weapon, but i guess . . . .""the judge then said, ""well, you know what you get to do with that, and i'm not being facetious, you get to call up your legislator and you get to ask him to change the law, but that's the law as it is right now.""  the judge then went on to quarrel with the juror's understanding of the law on which he had now twice been instructed, saying, ""it's not one-and-a-half inches, it's with that casement . . . .""  when finally asked again, ""do you have any problem applying that law?"" the most the juror would muster was, ""i guess not.""still, the judge did not dismiss the juror.  but, correctly, the judge did say, ""i guess not is not good enough for me because it's something that you may disagree with.""  he then went on, ""you have every right.  i disagree, we all disagree with some of the laws as it relates to some of the things that are prohibited by our government. . . .  but that's what the law is, and as a juror, regardless of your personal beliefs you have to apply the law.  will you be able to do that?""having thus been told that ""yes"" was the only answer that the judge would accept -- ""i guess not is not good enough,"" the judge said -- the juror did not even then say yes.  he responded again, ""well i thought that the jury had the power to choose whatever way to . . . .""  the judge interrupted the juror and said, ""i just told you it doesn't,"" which is incorrect as a matter of law, see commonwealth v. hebert,, 755 (1980) (""[i]t remains within the power of a juror to vote his or her conscience"").  the juror responded, ""so, there's a legal punishment if the jury does not . . . .""he was cut off by the judge, who misunderstood the juror's statement, thinking that he was addressing punishment of the defendant when, as the record reflects, the juror meant that he misunderstood the judge to have told him -- what is also incorrect -- that he (the juror) would be punished by law if he engaged in jury nullification.at this point, unsurprisingly, the defendant requested again thatpage 832the juror be discharged and, equally unsurprisingly, the commonwealth joined in that motion.2.  analysis.  although of course the commonwealth here argues in support of the verdict, at trial the prosecutor joined in the motion to discharge the juror based ""on what [juror no. twelve] said from day 1 that he couldn't be impartial after the opening statements and hearing from the first witness, and the fact that again now he's saying he doesn't believe that the law --.""  the judge denied the motion.  (and, less than two hours later the prosecutor informed the judge that she had filed a motion under g. l. c. 211, § 3, to the single justice of the supreme judicial court on an emergency basis to stay proceedings, and appealing the refusal to discharge juror no. twelve, a request that, given its interlocutory posture, the single justice unsurprisingly denied.)  having failed to persuade the judge, the commonwealth is not technically judicially estopped from defending the seating of the juror here, see otis v. arbella mut. ins. co.,, 644 (2005) (judicial estoppel precludes party from ""asserting a position inconsistent with a position previouslyasserted"" [emphasis supplied]), but its postverdict defense of the seating of the juror rings particularly hollow in light of its strenuous challenge to the juror at the time of trial.by the time of the joint motion to excuse the juror, he had repeatedly stated an inability or an unwillingness to apply the law as given, and he should have been excused for cause.  indeed, there can be little doubt that the judge's lengthy and repeated statements to the juror -- including both a refusal to accept an answer that the juror could not follow the law, and leaving the juror with the incorrect impression that he could be punished for voting his conscience -- may well have ""affect[ed] the juror'spage 833judgment.""  hebert, 379 mass. at 755 (judge's ""coercive"" interaction with juror, where juror believed that commonwealth had proved each element of crime beyond reasonable doubt but could not in good conscience convict, was improper); auguste, 414 mass. at 58 (juror may not be seated on basis of ""answers suggested or, in fact, required by the [judge's] questions"").for this independent reason, the juror should have been dismissed.  and even if either his statements on the first and second days of trial, or his statements after the jury were instructed, alone would not have warranted it, certainly taken together they required his dismissal.although i appreciate that trial judges sometimes may have a difficult task in ensuring that jurors do not impermissibly avoid their obligation to serve, and while the judge's decision not to dismiss juror no. twelve appears to have been at least partially motivated by the desire to avoid a mistrial,as both parties recognized below, he pushed too hard in this case, and impermissibly failed to excuse juror no. twelve for cause.for these reasons, it seems to me that a reversal of the judgmentspage 834is required.  i therefore respectfully dissent.",criminal,Christopher J.

[841-842]page 836at the trial of an indictment charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (i.e., pavement) causing serious bodily injury on theories of principal and joint venturer liability, a rational jury could have found, based on testimony by two eyewitnesses and other evidence, that it was the defendant himself (who was four inches taller than his coventurer and had tattoos while his coventurer did not) who slammed the victim to the pavement and caused his grievous injuries [842-843]; further, even considering the evidence of joint venture separately, the jury could have found, based on testimony from several witnesses that the defendant and his coventurer acted in concert throughout the course of the assault and fled together, that the defendant had the intent to touch the victim with the pavement in a dangerous fashion [843-844].at the trial of an indictment charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (i.e., pavement) causing serious bodily injury on theories of principal and joint venturer liability, the jury instructions, viewed as a whole, were erroneous in that they would have allowed the jury to convict the defendant of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon upon mere proof that he intended jointly with his conventurer to commit a simple assault and battery. [844-845]at the trial of an indictment charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (i.e., pavement) causing serious bodily injury on theories of principal and joint venturer liability, erroneous jury instructions that would have allowed the jury to convict the defendant of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon upon mere proof that he intended jointly with his conventurer to commit a simple assault and battery did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in that the jury, by convicting the defendant of kicking the victim, had to have found that the defendant consciously acted together with his conventurer throughout the assault, including at the climactic moment when the pavement was used as a dangerous weapon. [845-848] rubin, j., dissenting.at a criminal trial, the judge's inadvertent failure to instruct the jury that they could not draw an adverse inference from the defendant's decision not to testify did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in that the judge gave a clear instruction in his opening remarks to the venire that the defendant had an absolute right not to testify and that no negative inference could be drawn from his decision, reiterated in his opening instructions to the jury that the defendant had no obligation or burden to call witnesses or offer evidence and, although not using the specific words adverse inference in his final charge, carefully instructed on the presumption of innocence; moreover, the commonwealth's case was strong, and defense counsel's failure to object to the omission of the instruction suggests that it had minimal significance in the over-all context of the trial (and plausibly could have been a tactical decision). [848-850]","on the afternoon of august 30, 2013, two men attacked another man on a public street, inflicting life-altering injuries.  both men punched the victim, one slammed him to the pavement, and one or both kicked him while he lay on the ground.  after an eyewitness identified the defendant as one of the assailants, the defendant was indicted on charges of assault and battery, assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (to wit, pavement) causing serious bodily injury (abdw-sbi), and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (to wit, shod foot).  a jury convicted the defendant of all three charges.on appeal the defendant argues that (1) the motion judge should have suppressed the eyewitness's identification, (2) the evidencepage 837was insufficient to support a conviction of abdw-sbi under a theory of joint venture, (3) the trial judge erred in instructing the jury on the intent required for abdw-sbi under a theory of joint venture, and (4) the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that they could draw no adverse inference from the defendant's failure to testify, despite his request for such an instruction.  as to the third of these arguments, we agree that the joint venture instructions were erroneous because they did not convey to the jury that the defendant must have shared his coventurer's intent to use a dangerous weapon to be guilty of abdw-sbi.  nonetheless, we conclude that there is no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice because the jury, by convicting the defendant of assault and battery with a shod foot,necessarily rejected his theory that he withdrew from the assault before the climactic moment when the pavement was used as a dangerous weapon.  instead, the jury necessarily found that the defendant consciously acted together with his coventurer throughout the course of the assault, including at that climactic moment.  accordingly, and as we reject the defendant's remaining arguments, we affirm.background.1.  the assault.  jesse downs was walking on winter street near lafayette square in haverhill when, seemingly without provocation, two men attacked him.  four eyewitnesses to the assault testified at trial as follows.maria baez, a childhood acquaintance of downs, was driving on winter street when she saw downs and rolled down her window to say hello.  before she could do so, two ""dark complexion[ed]"" men walking behind downs yelled something that caught his attention.  they approached and immediately started punching downs in his upper body.  the shorter man held downs's hands, while the taller man with tattoos ""continued to punch, and at one point lift[ed] downs off the floor and dropped him on the ground.""  one of the two men -- baez did not remember which -- then kicked downs, while the other stood nearby, before both took off running down the street.  baez telephoned 911 and followed the two men as they ran up winter street.  a third man was at the scene but did not participate in the assault.christopher siek was driving on winter street when he saw two ""dark-skinned"" men punching a white man in the torso, whilepage 838a third man stood off to the side.  as the victim went into the street to avoid the punches, one of the two men followed him, ""picked him right up and just slammed him down . . . [l]ike a body slam.""  the attack ""happened so fast [siek] couldn't do anything.""  after siek sounded his horn, the three men ran up the street.kenneth farinelli was driving through lafayette square when he saw ""[t]hree african american[s]"" standing around a white man.  one of the men ""picked [the victim] up from around the waist"" and ""slammed [him] on his head.""  the three men then ""ran off.""james flanagan was driving through lafayette square when he saw two men with ""dark skin"" attacking a white man.  one ""fairly tall"" man ""picked [the victim] up and body slammed him.""  both men then kicked the victim in the head before running down the street together.  a third man was there but was not involved in the assault.downs was transported to the hospital, where he collapsed in the waiting room and was airlifted to another hospital to undergo emergency brain surgery.  four months after the assault, he was finally released from a rehabilitation facility.  by the time of trial in june of 2015, downs was still confined to a wheelchair, dependent on a feeding tube, and had a pump in his stomach ""to control the tone in his body.""  according to his girl friend, downs ""needs assistance with everything"" -- ""[h]e can't go to the bathroom on his own, he can't shower on his own.""2.  the investigation.  haverhill police officer bryan bailey was dispatched to winter street following ""a report that a male was laid out after being beat up.""  as he was heading that direction, he was redirected to a different location about one-quarter of a mile away.  there, he saw two men matching the descriptions provided by dispatch.  one man, later identified as the defendant, was wearing jeans and had a black tank top draped over his shoulder.  the other man was wearing a white shirt and jeans.officer bailey stopped the defendant and asked to speak with him.  the defendant ""went off,"" ""flailing his arms and yelling and screaming.""  the officer then asked dispatch to ""have the witness that was following [the two] individuals come to [his] location.""  although the officer did not see anyone arrive, he was told by dispatch ""that the witness had driven by and said the party [he]page 839had stopped was the correct person.""officer bailey drove the defendant back to the scene of the assault.  as he was taken out of the cruiser, the defendant started yelling at downs, to the effect of ""i hit you?  you said i fucking hit you?""  when downs could not make an identification, the officer returned the defendant to the cruiser and drove him to the police station.  during booking the defendant's height was recorded as six feet, two inches, and his weight as 160 pounds.officer jamie landry headed to a different location in search of the second suspect wearing the white shirt and jeans.  there, he saw a man known to him as xavier simms.  although simms admitted he had been with the defendant, the officer allowed him to leave because he did not match the description of either suspect.ten to fifteen minutes later, officer landry saw simms again, a few blocks from his previous location.  simms was with the defendant's brother and a man known to the officer as roberto hilerio.  several hours later, the three men entered the police station asking about the defendant.  sergeant meaghan buckley interacted with them and saw no tattoos on either hilerio or simms.  at some time thereafter, hilerio was arrested in connection with the assault; during booking his height was recorded as five feet, ten inches, and his weight as 180 pounds.officer dennis moriarty was transporting the defendant from the police station on the night of the assault.  while seated in the cruiser, the defendant asked ""multiple different times, different ways,"" ""how much time he could get for the crimes,"" ""if he was going to get life,"" and ""if he told the truth, could he get less time.""  he also said, ""seriously, i didn't kill no one, right? . . . i'm just going to say everything i did.  i can't go away for life.""also that night, the police interviewed baez.  she described one suspect as ""tall and skinny kind of like muscled with tattoos on his arms,"" wearing a black tank top and jeans, and the other as ""probably about five something height"" wearing a white shirt and jeans.  she stated that ""[t]he much taller, tattooed, dark-skinned guy lifted [downs] in the air and smashed him against the ground.""  she also stated that the ""much taller"" man ""was the one [who] did the kicking.""in october of 2013, sergeant buckley interviewed flanagan, who recalled that ""the bigger of the two"" men ""grabbed . . . thepage 840white guy and picked him up and slammed him on his head.""  according to flanagan, the man with the white shirt was ""le[ss] aggressive"" and ""smaller.""  he also stated that he saw an officer with ""the bigger,"" ""well-built"" man, and that that man was the one who had picked the victim up and dropped him on the ground.at trial the prosecutor asked the defendant to remove his shirt and show his arms, hands, and shoulder to the jury.  when he did so, he revealed three tattoos -- one on each hand and one on his right shoulder.3.  the defendant's case.  the defense's theory at trial was that, while the defendant ""threw a couple punches,"" he had stopped punching when ""out of nowhere"" hilerio ""ran up, grabbed mr. downs from behind, and picked him up and slammed him onto the street.""  the defendant was merely ""standing there watching this whole thing unfold.""in support of this theory, the defense elicited testimony from officer guy cooper that baez told him at the crime scene that a man ""with a white t-shirt"" had slammed downs to the ground.  the defense also called simms, who testified that the defendant had ""stopped throwing punches"" and ""backed up"" when hilerio ""jumped in,"" picked downs up, and dropped him.  according to simms, the defendant was just ""standing there,"" and ""then after that, he took off.""  finally, the defense called the defendant's brother, who testified that hilerio told him that ""he slammed the guy down"" and the defendant ""didn't know he was going to do it.""discussion.  1.  motion to suppress.  the motion judge made the following findings regarding baez's identification.  after witnessing the attack, baez telephoned 911 and gave a description of the suspects.  she continued to relay information to dispatch as she followed the suspects in her vehicle.within two to four minutes of the 911 call, officer bailey saw an individual, identified at the motion to suppress hearing as the defendant, who matched baez's description.  the officer stopped the defendant on fifth avenue and conducted a patfrisk.  the defendant became ""very agitated"" and started ""flailing his arms and yelling.""  as a result, the officer arrested the defendant for disorderly conduct, handcuffed him, and put him in the cruiser.while this was happening, the dispatcher told baez to go to fifth avenue and wait in her vehicle for an officer to come over.  instead of following these instructions, baez drove by and observed the defendant with officer bailey.  she then telephonedpage 841back to dispatch and stated that the person the officer was holding was one of the perpetrators.  when baez drove by, officer bailey was in the process of arresting the defendant but had not yet placed him in the cruiser.based on these findings, the motion judge ruled that baez's identification was admissible because it did not result from ""unnecessarily suggestive"" circumstances.  we review this ruling only for abuse of discretion as it is uncontested that the identification did ""not arise from a police procedure.""  see commonwealth v. johnson,, 602 (2016).  an abuse of discretion occurs if the ""decision resulted from a clear error of judgment in weighing the factors relevant to the decision . . . such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives.""  ibid. (quotation omitted).out-of-court identifications made without police wrongdoing are analyzed under common law principles of fairness, as articulated in commonwealth v. jones,, 109 (1996).  see johnson, 473 mass. at 598.  a judge applying those principles ""may decline to admit an unreliable eyewitness identification that resulted from a 'highly' or 'especially' suggestive confrontation with the defendant.""  id. at 598-599, quoting from jones, 423 mass. at 109.  the defendant bears the burden of proving suggestiveness by a preponderance of the evidence.  see id. at 599.  if he meets that burden, then the judge must weigh ""the probative value of the identification against the danger of unfair prejudice"" arising from the suggestive circumstances.  id. at 600.here, the motion judge assumed that the defendant was already handcuffed when baez drove by, but concluded that that alone did not render the circumstances of her identification ""unnecessarily suggestive.""the defendant does not contend that the judge abused his discretion in this respect.  in fact, he concedes that thepage 842judge was correct.  see commonwealth v. phillips,, 627-628 (2008) (showup procedure was not unnecessarily suggestive even though defendant was in police wagon, handcuffed and flanked by two officers).nevertheless, the defendant argues that baez's identification was so unreliable -- because, among other reasons, she drove by quickly, while distracted, and without stopping to hear instructions from the officer -- that it should have been suppressed.  but under the jones framework, a judge need not conduct a reliability analysis unless the defendant first demonstrates the existence of especially suggestive circumstances.  see jones, 423 mass. at 109; johnson, 473 mass. at 604.  because the defendant failed to make that showing here, the motion judge properly left the reliability of baez's identification to the jury to decide.2.  sufficiency of the evidence.  the defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence only as to his conviction of abdw-sbi.  as to this charge, the commonwealth proceeded on theories of both principal and joint venturer liability, and the jury returned a general guilty verdict.  while not contesting that the evidence was sufficient to convict him as a principal, the defendant argues that he could not be convicted as a coventurer because the commonwealth failed to prove that he knew or intended that hilerio would throw downs to the pavement.  in considering this challenge, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the commonwealth to determine whether any ""rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.""  commonwealth v. mendez,, 523 (2017).the flaw in the defendant's argument is that, under commonwealth v. zanetti,, 468 (2009), a reviewing court does not ""examine the sufficiency of the evidence separately as to principal and joint venture liability.""  instead, we ask ""whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged, with the intent required to commit the crime.""  ibid.  see commonwealth v. housen,, 706-707 (2011); commonwealth v. barbosa,, 665 (2017).  regarding the charge here, the intent required is general -- the commonwealth must provepage 843""that the defendant intentionally touched the victim . . . with an inherently dangerous weapon or an object used in a dangerous fashion"" without justification, resulting in serious bodily injury.commonwealth v. vick,, 432 (2009).viewed in the light most favorable to the commonwealth, the evidence supports a finding that the defendant was the assailant who threw downs to the pavement, establishing that the defendant had the requisite knowledge and intent to commit the crime.  baez testified and stated in her police interview that the taller man with tattoos dropped downs on the ground.  similarly, flanagan testified that the ""fairly tall"" man ""body slammed"" downs, and he stated in his police interview that the ""bigger"" man picked downs up and dropped him.  given the additional evidence that the defendant was four inches taller than hilerio, and has tattoos while hilerio does not, a rational jury could have found that it was the defendant himself who slammed downs to the pavement, causing his grievous injuries.furthermore, even examining the evidence of joint venture separately as the defendant requests,we conclude that it was sufficient to support his conviction.  ""[t]here is no need to prove an anticipatory compact between the parties to establish joint venture . . . if, at the climactic moment the parties consciously acted together in carrying out the criminal endeavor.""  commonwealth v. sexton,, 152 (1997) (quotation omitted).  here, there was testimony from several witnesses that the defendant and hilerio acted in concert throughout the course of the assault.  the two men approached downs together and attacked him in a coordinated fashion, one holding his hands while the other punched him.  after downs was thrown to the pavement, the defendant continued the assault by kicking him.  the two men then fled together.  ""at no time during [the] conflict did the defendant seek to withdraw.""  ibid.from this evidence the jury could have found that the defendant had the intent to touch downs with the pavement in a dangerous fashion.  see vick, 454 mass. at 432.  contrary to the defendant's contention, the commonwealth did not need to prove that he knew or intended in advance that the pavement would bepage 844used during the assault.  see sexton, 425 mass. at 152.  rather, the jury could have inferred the requisite knowledge and intent from the evidence that the defendant kicked downs immediately after he was slammed to the pavement.  see ibid. (although defendant ""may not initially have had knowledge that his brother intended to use the pavement to effectuate the attack,"" jury could still convict him as coventurer based on his actions of ""continuously kick[ing] and punch[ing] [the victim] while his brother repeatedly slammed [the victim's] head into the pavement""); commonwealth v. lugo,, 232-233 (2016) (evidence sufficient to support conviction of assault and battery with knife, where defendant and coventurer pursued victim together and defendant kicked victim while coventurer stabbed him).  cf. commonwealth v. johnson,, 545 (2017) (there was probable cause that defendant shared intent to use glass as dangerous weapon, where ""after [coventurer] struck the victim with the glass, [defendant] did not retreat from the combat, but instead went after the victim himself"").3.  instructions on joint venture.  we next consider the defendant's challenge to the joint venture instructions, which he says were deficient because they failed to ""advise the jury that the aider and abettor needed to share the principal's intent that some dangerous weapon be used.""  consistent with zanetti, 454 mass. at 467-468, the trial judge instructed the jury that the defendant was guilty of abdw-sbi if the commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he ""knowingly and meaningfully participated in the commission of the crime of [abdw-sbi]"" and ""had the intent required for that particular crime.""  the judge then gave a more specific instruction on intent.  after first explaining that the principal must have ""intentionally used pavement as a means of inflicting serious harm,"" the judge instructed as follows on the intent required of an aider and abettor:""the intent required [of] an aider and abettor is different.  the aider and abettor must have intended a joint venture with the principal to assault and batter jesse downs.  the aider and abettor need not have agreed to use pavement as a dangerous weapon, or even known or intended that the principal use pavement as a dangerous weapon.""the aider and abettor must have intended that he and the principal would jointly commit an assault and battery upon jesse downs.  that is, the aider and abettor must have intendedpage 845a joint enterprise with the principal to assault and beat jesse downs in a harmful way, without justification or excuse.""we agree with the defendant that these instructions were erroneous in that they would have allowed the jury to convict the defendant of abdw-sbi upon mere proof that he intended jointly with hilerio to commit a simple assault and battery.  the commonwealth's burden was higher:  it had to prove that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the charged offense ""with the intent required for that offense,"" zanetti, 454 mass. at 468, which for abdw-sbi includes intent to use a dangerous weapon.  but it is not the case, as the defendant argues, that ""such proof could be established only by evidence that mr. hilerio communicated to [the defendant] that he intended to . . . use the pavement as a weapon or that [the defendant] urged him to use or otherwise supported his use of it.""  again, the jury could infer the requisite intent from evidence that ""at the climactic moment the parties consciously acted together in carrying out the criminal endeavor.""  sexton, 425 mass. at 152 (quotation omitted).  see lugo, 89 mass. app. ct. at 232-233; johnson, 92 mass. app. ct. at 544-545.  nevertheless, the instructions here, viewed as a whole and notwithstanding the judge's accurate statement of zanetti, did not clearly apprise the jury of this element of the crime.  see commonwealth v. thomas,, 119 (1987), quoting from connolly v. commonwealth,, 536 (1979) (""[n]o general statement of the charges can remedy a specific instruction which is defective 'unless the general statement clearly indicates that its consideration must be imported into the defective instruction'"").the error does not, however, require automatic reversal of the defendant's conviction as he suggests.  ""although constitutional error, the omission of an element of the crime from the jury instruction is not among the very limited class of structural errors subject to automatic reversal, and upon proper objection would be subject to harmless error analysis.""  commonwealth v. redmond,, 7 (2001).  see commonwealth v. palmer,, 424-425 (2003).  the defendant claims that he preserved his objection, but the record demonstrates, to the contrary, that he affirmatively agreed with the instructions.we must therefore determine whether the error created a substantialpage 846risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. alphas,, 15 (1999); commonwealth v. loadholt,, 427 (2010).  this standard requires us to ""review the evidence and the case as a whole, considering the strength of the commonwealth's case, as well as the nature and significance of the alleged errors.""  commonwealth v. chase,, 299 (2001).  after doing so, we will reverse the verdict ""only in the extraordinary situation where . . . we are left with uncertainty that the defendant's guilt has been fairly adjudicated.""  ibid.the commonwealth argues that no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice exists because ""the overwhelming weight of credible evidence suggested that the defendant"" was the principal in the assault.  it is true that, under the substantial risk standard, overwhelming evidence of guilt can overcome an error in instructing on an element of the offense.  see alphas, 430 mass. at 15.  but the evidence here, while certainly sufficient to convict the defendant as the principal, would also support a finding that hilerio was the one who threw downs to the pavement.the cases suggest that a greater quantum of evidence is needed for us to conclude that justice did not miscarry.  see commonwealth v. azar,, 688-689 (2002) (erroneous malice instruction created substantial risk of miscarriage of justice where commonwealth's evidence was ""strong"" but ""controverted"" and malicepage 847could not be ""ineluctably inferred"").the verdicts that the jury actually returned, however, allow us to conclude that there is no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  even under harmless error analysis, ""an instructional omission, misdescription, or conclusive presumption"" does not mandate reversal ""where other facts necessarily found by the jury are the 'functional equivalent' of the omitted, misdescribed, or presumed element.""  neder v. united states, 527 u.s. 1, 13 (1999).  cf. commonwealth v. britt,, 98-99 (2013) (omission of instruction on knowledge of dangerous weapon did not create substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice where jury, by convicting defendant of other counts, necessarily found that she herself possessed a firearm); united states v. baldwin, 987 f.2d 1432, 1438-1439 (9th cir. 1993) (failure to give overt act instruction was harmless error where jury could not have convicted defendant of other counts without finding overt act); united states v. johnson, 216 f.3d 1162, 1167 (d.c. cir. 2000) (error in defining ""use"" and ""carry"" was harmless where jury could not have convicted defendant of another count without finding ""act that constitutes both 'using' and 'carrying'"").  furthermore, where ""the omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence, such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error, the erroneous instruction is properly found to be harmless.""  neder, 527 u.s. at 17.  see alphas, 430 mass. at 15; loadholt, 456 mass. at 427.in this case, by convicting the defendant of simple assault and battery and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (shod foot), the jury necessarily found that the defendant punched downs and then kicked him once he was on the pavement.  this means, in turn, that the jury necessarily rejected the defendant's theory that he threw a few punches and then withdrew from the conflict.  critically, this was the only theory presented by the defense.  the defense did not argue, and no reasonable view of the evidence would permit a finding, that the defendant withdrew from the rapidly unfolding conflict before downs was thrown to the pavement, then returned to kick him moments later.  therefore, by convicting the defendant of kicking downs, the jury had to have found that he ""consciously acted together"" with hilerio throughout the assault, including ""at the climactic moment"" when the pavement was used as a dangerous weapon.  sexton, 425 mass. at 152 (quotation omitted).no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice exists in these circumstances.  under sexton, proof that a defendant ""consciouslypage 848acted together"" with his coventurer at the moment a dangerous weapon is used is alone sufficient to show the defendant's intent to commit assault and battery by means of that dangerous weapon.  ibid.  accord lugo, 89 mass. app. ct. at 233.  were the rule otherwise, assailants who participate in a group attack would be insulated from criminal liability where it is not possible to determine which one used which weapon or inflicted which injuries.  but in a joint venture situation, our law does not require the commonwealth to prove who actually committed the crime and who aided and abetted it.  see zanetti, 454 mass. at 468.  thus, it is enough here that the defendant was consciously participating in the assault at the point when either he or hilerio used the pavement as a dangerous weapon.  see sexton, 425 mass. at 152; lugo, 89 mass. app. ct. at 233.against this legal backdrop, the jury's finding that the defendant did not withdraw from the conflict is critical, and our reliance on that finding does not ""eliminate[] the shared intent requirement,"" as the dissent posits.  post at 852.  again, once the jury determined that the defendant kicked downs, no view of the evidence would have allowed them to conclude that he was anything other than an active participant in the conflict when, moments earlier, downs was thrown to the pavement.  contrary to the dissent's view, see post at 853, it is of no legal consequence that the kicking occurred immediately after the assault with the pavement, as compared to sexton where the two acts appeared to have occurred simultaneously.  what matters is whether the defendant was consciously acting together with hilerio during the assault with the pavement.  the verdicts returned by the jury, in light of the evidence presented, compel the conclusion that he was.in reaching the result that we do, we do not, as the dissent puts it, ""in effect usurp the jury's function.""  post at 851.  rather, we ""in typical appellate-court fashion, ask[] whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.""  neder, 527 u.s. at 19.  here, based on the evidence and the verdicts that the jury actually returned, we are confident that the error in the instruction did not materially influence the outcome of the trial.  that is, this is not the ""extraordinary situation where . . . we are left with uncertainty that the defendant's guilt has been fairly adjudicated.""  chase, 433 mass. at 299.4.  failure to give ""no adverse inference"" instruction.  finally, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in failing to instructpage 849the jury that they could not draw an adverse inference from the defendant's decision not to testify.  before the close of the commonwealth's case, the defendant requested such an instruction, but the judge, it appears inadvertently, did not give one.  because the defendant did not bring the omission to the judge's attention, our standard of review again is whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. dussault,, 544 (2008).we discern no such risk.  the judge gave a clear instruction in his opening remarks to the venire that the defendant had ""an absolute right not to testify"" and no ""negative inference"" could be drawn from his decision.  see commonwealth v. cintron,, 786 (2003) (instructions given to venire ""will be considered along with the judge's final instructions in deciding whether the instructions were correct"").  in his opening instructions to the jury, the judge reiterated that the defendant had ""no obligation, no burden"" to call witnesses or offer evidence.  and although in the final charge the judge did not use the specific words ""adverse inference,"" he carefully instructed on the presumption of innocence and then stated:  ""the presumption of innocence also means that no person ever has to prove his innocence.  no person charged with a crime ever has to explain anything or prove anything to a jury.  exactly the contrary is true.""  considering these instructions as a whole, we view them as similar to those that the supreme judicial court has held to ""satisf[y] the requirement for an instruction minimizing the danger that the jury will draw an adverse inference from the defendant's decision not to testify.""  commonwealth v. gilchrist,, 219 (1992).  cf. commonwealth v. feroli,, 410-411 (1990) (no substantial likelihood of miscarriage of justice where judge did not use specific words ""no adverse inference"" but did instruct that ""defendant has the absolute right to remain passive and require the commonwealth to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt"").moreover, it is fair to say that the commonwealth's case was strong, and defense counsel's failure to object to the omission of the instruction suggests that it had minimal significance in the overall context of the trial.  in fact, we think it plausible, as the commonwealth argues, that counsel could have made a tactical decision not to object in order to draw the jury's attention away from ""the question why the defendant decided not to assist the jury in their fact-finding function"" and to focus them instead onpage 850the three witnesses who testified on his behalf.  commonwealth v. buiel,, 746-747 (1984).  see dussault, 71 mass. app. ct. at 545.  and unlike in commonwealth v. botelho,, 852-853 (2015), on which the defendant heavily relies, the prosecutor in her closing argument did not comment on the defendant's decision not to testify.  in this situation we can conclude with confidence that the omission did not materially affect the jury's verdicts.judgments affirmed.the jury in this case were not instructed on an element of the offense of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (to wit, pavement) causing serious bodily injury.  they were not told that, assuming the defendant was not the principal, in order to convict him as a joint venturer in the commission of the crime with which he was charged, they were required to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant shared with the principal, roberto hilerio, the intent to use a dangerous weapon when the principal did so by hurling the victim to the pavement.  see commonwealth v. zanetti,, 466 (2009) (judge must instruct jury that conviction of crime as joint venturer requires proof beyond reasonable doubt that ""the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged . . . with the intent required for that offense"").indeed, they were told they could convict him if he merely had the intent to assault and batter, which, the overwhelming evidence showed, he certainly did.  because no objection was made to the inadequacy of the instruction on intent, we are required to determine whether the failure to instruct the jury that they were required to find this element beyond a reasonable doubt created a substantialpage 851risk of a miscarriage of justice.under settled law, because the evidence did not compel a finding that the defendant had the requisite intent, the error did create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  see commonwealth v. redmond,, 8 (2001).  because the court majority finds to the contrary only by effectively replacing the shared intent requirement for joint venturers with respect to use of a dangerous weapon with a weaker requirement that they were already ""consciously acting together"" with the principal, i must respectfully dissent.when we uphold the conviction of an individual in the absence of a jury instruction on an essential element of the offense, we in effect usurp the jury's function.  an individual may be found guilty of a crime, of course, only after a finding that each element of the offense has been proven has been made by a jury, not by a panel of appellate judges who have not heard the live testimony or deliberated about the evidence as jurors do.  and, of course, it is a bedrock principle of due process that one may not be convicted of a crime, with, among other things, the attendant loss of liberty, unless each essential element of the offense has been proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  see in re winship, 397 u.s. 358, 364 (1970).  when we uphold a conviction in these circumstances, by definition the jury, which has not been instructed on an element of the offense, has not explicitly found it proven beyond a reasonable doubt.thus, although our cases hold that not every failure to instruct on an essential element of the offense creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in light of the fundamental nature of such an error, a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice must be found unless the presence of that element can be ""ineluctably inferred"" from the evidence, commonwealth v. azar,, 688 (2002) (quotation omitted), that is, unless the evidence ""required the jurors to find"" the essential element on which they were not instructed.  ibid.the rule does not create a ""presum[ption,]"" ante at note 9.  as in all cases of unpreserved error, the burden to show a substantialpage 852risk of a miscarriage of justice lies with the defendant.  but the law is clear.  as justice grasso wrote in commonwealth v. redmond, 53 mass. app. ct. at 8, a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is created by failure to instruct on an element of the offense unless ""the only permissible inference"" from the evidence is that the element was present.  the defendant's burden in this circumstance thus is to show merely that that is not the only permissible inference.  this is what creates the requisite ""uncertainty that the defendant's guilt has been fairly adjudicated,"" that requires reversal.  commonwealth v. chase,, 299 (2001).thus, while viewed with a wide-angle lens it may be an ""extraordinary situation"" in which we find a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, ibid., where the judge fails to instruct the jury on an essential element of the offense -- itself, i hope an extraordinary situation --  it is an ordinary one.  unsurprisingly, both the supreme judicial court and our court conclude routinely that that such a failure has created such a risk.  indeed, the supreme judicial court has reached such a conclusion without even mentioning, let alone analyzing, the possibility that failure to instruct on an essential element of the offense might not create such a risk, see commonwealth v. paquette,, 802 (2016), and we have made clear that in at least some circumstances when a jury is not charged on, and therefore has not found, an essential element of the offense, a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice is ""inherent.""  commonwealth v. gorman,, 492 (2013).while i agree with the court majority that the evidence in this case would have supported a finding that the defendant, if he was acting as a joint venturer and not a principal, shared the intent of the principal, the evidence does not compel such a finding.the court majority does not conclude otherwise.  instead it asks a different question, one that eliminates the shared intent requirement:  whether the defendant consciously acted together with the principal throughout the assault and battery or, instead, ""withdrew from the rapidly unfolding conflict before [the victim] was thrown to the pavement.""  ante at 847.  because this is the question it asks, the court majority then suggests that, given the other verdicts, the only way the defendant could not have had the intent required would be if he ""withdrew from the . . . conflict before downs was thrown to the pavement, then returned to kick him moments later,"" a most unlikely scenario.page 853the court majority concludes unsurprisingly that the jury's other verdicts demonstrate that the jury found the defendant did not withdraw in this exceedingly implausible way.  it concludes that ""by convicting the defendant of kicking [the victim],"" after he was thrown to the pavement, ""the jury had to have found that [the defendant] 'consciously acted together' with hilerio throughout the assault, including 'at the climactic moment' when [the victim] was thrown to the pavement.""  ante at 847, quoting from commonwealth v. sexton,, 152 (1997).  this, the majority concludes, demonstrates there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, regardless of whether the defendant actually had the intent to use a dangerous weapon at the moment when (by hypothesis) hilerio threw the victim to the pavement.but to convict the defendant on the joint venture theory, the jury were required, as the majority explains elsewhere in its opinion, not merely to find that the parties ""consciously acted together,"" before and after the climactic moment, or that the defendant did not withdraw prior to it, but to find that the defendant had the intent at the moment of the principal throwing the victim to the pavement to assault and batter the victim by means of a dangerous weapon.  since the use of the pavement was the first use of a dangerous weapon in the assault, if hilerio was the principal the defendant might at that moment not have had the intent to use a dangerous weapon not because he withdrew, but because he had not yet formed the intent to use a dangerous weapon at the time when hilerio suddenly acted.  that the defendant had acted together with hilerio prior to this moment demonstrated only an intent to assault and batter; that the defendant had an intent to use a dangerous weapon (his shod foot) afterward suffices to support a finding that he had the requisite shared intent at the prior time when the victim was thrown to the ground, but it does not compel such a conclusion.  thus, in holding that the necessary implication of the defendant ""consciously acting together"" with hilerio both before and after the victim was thrown to the pavement is that the defendant had the requisite intent to be convicted as a joint venturer for throwing the victim to the pavement, the majority reads the shared intent requirement out of its analysis.an examination of the defendant's conviction for kicking the victim may make the point more clearly.  the majority and i agree that the critical evidence necessary to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant shared the requisite intent ispage 854the defendant's own assault of the victim with a dangerous weapon, his shod foot.  see ante at 847.  but this conduct came after the victim was thrown to the pavement, the first use of a dangerous weapon against the victim.  whether, at the ""climactic moment"" when the victim was thrown to the pavement the defendant already had an intent to utilize a dangerous weapon, or instead was surprised by such use of the pavement, and developed his own intent only afterward, is thus a question for the jury.  the finding that he shared the principal's intent at that moment was neither ""required"" nor did the evidence make it ""ineluctable.""  it was not the only inference the jury could have drawn.  see redmond, 53 mass. app. ct. at 8.  therefore the failure to instruct on intent created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.the court majority may be read to suggest that if i am correct, ""assailants who participate in a group attack would be insulated from criminal liability where it is not possible to determine which one used which weapon or inflicted which injuries.""  ante at 848.  but this conflates sufficiency of the evidence with the question of whether failure to instruct creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  of course assailants in a group attack can be, and routinely are, convicted as joint venturers (just as, on retrial, the defendant may be convicted here), so long as a jury actually finds the assailants share the requisite intent with the principal.  the evidence here (and in all such similar cases) is sufficient to support such a finding.  it just does not in this case compel it.  and therefore, because, and only because, the jury were erroneously instructed they did not have to find shared intent, the defendant is entitled to a new trial on this charge.commonwealth v. sexton, 425 mass. at 152, to the extent it is relevant -- the court there did not hold that the jury were required to find the requisite intent, only that there was sufficient evidence to support such a finding -- supports my analysis and my conclusion.  the supreme judicial court explicitly noted there that the defendant ""may not initially have had knowledge that [the principal] intended to use the pavement to effectuate the attack.""  ibid.  it stated, however, that it was ""apparent"" that the defendant shared the principal's intent, but only because ""the defendant continuously kicked and punched [the victim] while [the principal] repeatedly slammed [the victim's] head into the pavement.""  ibid.  the critical fact that made the defendant's shared intent to use the pavement as a dangerous weapon apparent in that case was that the principal slammed the victim's head against thepage 855pavement not only before but also after the defendant himself began kicking the victim.  by contrast, the court recognized that at the time of the principal's initial use of the pavement as a dangerous weapon, the defendant, as here, may not have had sufficient knowledge to share his intent.  ibid.because evidence is absent here that ineluctably requires a finding of shared intent at the climactic moment when, by hypothesis, hilerio threw the victim to the ground, under our case law, the failure to instruct the jury properly on the essential element of intent with respect to the one charge at issue created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.  because i conclude as a consequence that there must be a new trial on this charge, i must respectfully

[857-863]","the defendant was convicted of possession of a class a substance (heroin) and possession of a class b substance (cocaine), and he now appeals.  the issue he raises involves application of the rule announced in rodriques v. furtado,, 888 (1991) (furtado), allowing the manual search of a body cavity only with a warrant ""issued by the authority of a judge, on a strong showing of particularized need supported by a high degree of probable cause,"" to a circumstance where police seek to remove an item partially protruding from an arrestee's rectum.page 857background.  after a hearing on the defendant's motion to suppress, the motion judge found the following facts.  at the police station after his arrest, the defendant complained that he did not feel well because he had swallowed ""fifties.""  lieutenant david callahan of the revere police department, to whom he complained, understood ""fifties"" to refer to fifty dollar bags of heroin or cocaine.  callahan did not believe him because the defendant was not exhibiting signs of a drug overdose, and callahan thought that the defendant was feigning illness.  nevertheless, callahan followed protocol and summoned medical assistance.the defendant sat on a bench during the booking process.  callahan saw that he sat oddly, leaning to one side.  the defendant told callahan that he might throw up, so callahan brought him into a nearby cell that had a sink and toilet.callahan noticed that the defendant had an unusual gait as he walked to the cell, and that he was not walking ""normally.""  the defendant moved slowly, was rigid and tense, and was ""clenching his buttocks area.""  callahan believed that he might have something secreted in that area, which could be a potential safety risk.callahan asked officer joseph singer to accompany the defendant and callahan to the eight foot by eight foot cell.  callahan ordered the defendant to remove his clothing.  reluctantly, the defendant removed his shirt, pants, and socks.  he became argumentative when asked to remove his underpants.callahan noticed that the defendant, while wearing only underwear, continued to clench his buttocks and attempted to shield his backside from callahan's and singer's view.  singer concluded that the defendant was taking a fighting stance.  callahan became concerned that the defendant might be hiding a weapon.  callahan had singer handcuff one arm of the defendant while holding the defendant's other arm.the defendant pulled down his waistband and said words to the effect of, ""[s]ee i don't have anything.""  officer singer, however, saw a plastic bag protruding from the defendant's buttocks.  singer ordered the defendant to remove the bag or have singer remove it.  the defendant agreed to remove it himself and then pulled down his underwear.  singer put his hand on top of the defendant's hand as the defendant ""removed the bag.""  the bag contained fifteen individually wrapped bags of cocaine and thirteen individually wrapped bags of heroin.analysis.  our cases have distinguished among three related types of searches relevant to this appeal:  strip searches, visualpage 858body cavity searches, and manual body cavity searches.  ""a strip search generally refers to an inspection of a naked individual, without any scrutiny of his body cavities.  a visual body cavity search extends to a visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.""  commonwealth v. thomas,, 407 n.4 (1999).  a manual body cavity search ""involves some degree of touching and probing of body cavities.""  id. at 408.  we have said that ""[i]t is difficult to imagine a more intrusive, humiliating, and demeaning search than"" a manual body cavity search.  furtado, 410 mass. at 888.  indeed, ""strip or visual body cavity searches, by their very nature, are humiliating, demeaning, and terrifying experiences that, without question, constitute a substantial intrusion on one's personal privacy rights protected under the fourth amendment [to the united states constitution] and art. 14 [of the massachusetts declaration of rights],"" commonwealth v. vick,, 628 (2016), quoting from commonwealth v. morales,, 339-340 (2012), and ""[m]anual body cavity searches constitute an even greater intrusion on a person's privacy rights,"" ibid.  consequently, the supreme judicial court has held that in massachusetts, even when the police undertake a search incident to a lawful arrest -- in which circumstance case law holds that a strip search may be conducted without a warrant only when the police have ""probable cause to believe that the defendant had concealed [drugs] on his person or his clothing that would not otherwise be discovered by the usual search incident to arrest,"" commonwealth v. prophete,, 554 (2005)-- ""a judicially authorized warrant based on 'a strong showing of particularized need supported by a high degree of probable cause' is required for a manual body cavity search.""  vick, 90 mass. app. ct. at 629, quoting from furtado, 410 mass. at 888.  accord furtado, 410 mass. at 888 (warrant to search plaintiff's vagina, issued by assistant clerk-magistrate and presumptively based upon probable cause, not adequate).the defendant argues that this was not merely a search, but a seizure, of the plastic bag from a body cavity, his rectum, and, applying the principles concerning manual body cavity searches articulated in furtado, that seizures from a body cavity may be made only on the authority of a warrant issued by a judge and supported by a high degree of probable cause.  we agree.page 859the commonwealth's primary argument in response to the defendant's contention is factual.  it argues that all that occurred here was a permissible strip search, because, as a matter of fact, the plastic bag was seized not from the defendant's rectum, but from what it refers to as his ""intergluteal cleft.""  our cases indicate that items hidden between the buttocks are not within a ""body cavity,"" and that if a strip search reveals items there that easily fall out, it has not necessarily crossed the line to a manual body cavity search.  see vick, 90 mass. app. ct. at 629, 633 (observation of protruding bag of drugs that ""was in the 'cleft' of the defendant's buttocks, and not lodged in his rectum,"" but which fell out with ""mere[] 'flick[ing]' or 'brush[ing],'"" involved nothing more intrusive than strip search).the motion judge, however, did not find that the plastic bag was merely held between the defendant's buttocks, nor could he have on the evidence before him.  the commonwealth sought to defend this as a strip search, and in order to make its case, it had the burden to provide evidence from which the judge could find that no portion of the bag was within the defendant's rectum.  see commonwealth v. taylor,, 454 (1980) (""the burden of justifying the intrusion of a search is on the commonwealth"").  the commonwealth's witnesses, however, provided no testimony indicating that the bag was simply lodged between the defendant's buttocks, entirely outside his rectum.  contrast vick, 90 mass. app. ct. at 629 n.12 (officer agreed that no ""portion of th[e] item [was] within [the defendant's] rectum or within any sort of orifice of his body"" and that he ""[did not] have to use force to get the bag out of any sort of body cavity"").  nor is there any testimony, as there was in vick, indicating that the plastic bag was outside the defendant's rectum such that it easily fell or popped out when the defendant and the officer touched it.  rather, officer singer testified only that the defendant ""spread one cheek and we reached in and retrieved [the bag] from inside his butt,"" rather than from between his buttocks, and that ""he helped me with the cuffs on to take the drugs out of his butt.""  the commonwealth thus did not present sufficient evidence to support a finding of the fact it asserts:  that the protruding plastic bag was not partially within the defendant's rectum.that the judge did not find that the plastic bag was merely held betweenpage 860the defendant's buttocks is confirmed by his conclusion, in the ""analysis"" section of his memorandum of decision, that the reason this was not a cavity search is that the defendant himself removed the bag (a point we discuss later).  the judge wrote:  ""the strip search did not cross over to a cavity search.  singer ordered [the defendant] to remove the bag that he could see protruding from his buttocks or in the alternative have singer remove it.  [the defendant] agreed to, and did, remove it himself.""  this analysis of why there was no ""cross over"" would have been unnecessary had the judge concluded that the bag was merely lodged between the defendant's buttocks.the commonwealth argues next that this could not have been a manual body cavity search because the police did not ""manipulate[e] the defendant's body"" or ""touch[] or prob[e] . . . [the defendant's] body cavities.""  vick, 90 mass. app. ct. at 625.  butpage 861this misses the defendant's point that, regardless of the scope of any search, there was a seizure from his body cavity.  the commonwealth does not address this at all.the commonwealth also argues that, as the motion judge concluded, there cannot have been a body cavity search because the defendant removed the bag himself.  even assuming the removal of the bag by the defendant and the police officer together could be characterized as removal by the defendant himself, and applying the commonwealth's search argument to what the defendant actually contends is a seizure, the question before us is not the manner of the seizure, but the propriety of the seizure itself.  the officer ordered the defendant to remove the bag, threatening that otherwise he would do so himself.  the commonwealth provides no reason why it makes any difference whose hand removed the bag, nor any citation to relevant authority.  when a defendant gives something to a police officer after being ordered to do so, the police are nonetheless responsible for the seizure.  see, e.g., commonwealth v. torres,, 156 (1997) (trooper seized defendant's wallet when trooper ""had [the defendant] turn around and motioned for [the defendant's] wallet by pointing to his rear pants pocket and opening and closing his hand,"" and defendant ""produced his wallet for the trooper"").turning finally, then, to the propriety of the police action here, we agree with the defendant's characterization of it as a seizure from within a body cavity, in this case, the defendant's rectum.  the removal of an item from within a body cavity from which it is protruding is no less serious an invasion of one's body than a search of that cavity for evidence in the first place.  the commonwealth does not argue otherwise.  the principles articulated in furtado to address manual body cavity searches are equally applicable in the circumstance of a seizure from within a body cavity.  and indeed, many other jurisdictions have concluded that an item partially protruding from an arrestee's rectum cannot be seized without a warrant in the absence of exigent circumstances, applying the same test to such seizures as they do to manual body cavity searches.  see, e.g., united states v. fowlkes, 804 f.3d 954, 961-962 (9th cir. 2015); state v. barnes, 215 ariz. 279, 281-282 (ct. app. 2007); people v. hall, 10 n.y.3d 303, 311 (2008); hughes v. commonwealth, 31 va. app. 447, 459 (2000).  see alsopage 862schmerber v. california, 384 u.s. 757, 772 (1966) (police ""intrusions into an individual's body"" in search of evidence presumptively require warrant in absence of exigent circumstances).  in this commonwealth, manual body cavity searches require a judicially authorized warrant based on a particularized need supported by heightened probable cause, and we conclude that the same requirements apply with respect to a seizure of an item from within a body cavity.the commonwealth argues lastly that if a judicial warrant were required, there were exigent circumstances excusing its failure to obtain one, specifically a safety risk to the officers and the defendant from any hidden weapon.  however, even assuming the officers could still have had an objectively reasonable belief that the completely naked defendant was hiding a weapon -- after seeing only a plastic bag that did not fall out easily when touched, protruding from between his partially spread buttocks -- the defendant was handcuffed in a jail cell and, were that not adequate, could have been restrained in a reasonable manner to ensure safety pending the application to a judge for a warrant.the defendant also argues that the seizure could be undertaken only by trained medical personnel, at one point urging that only a medical doctor may properly execute a warrant for a seizure from a body cavity.  searches and seizures involving body cavities, like all searches and seizures by government officials, must be performed in a reasonable manner.  given that risk of medical harm is one of the reasons behind the heightened requirements prefatory to a search of or seizure from a body cavity, ""the potential harm to a detainee's health and dignity should be taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of the intrusion.""  morales, 462 mass. at 343. cf. schmerber, 384 u.s. at 771-772 (in case concerning blood draw, reserving ""the serious questions which would arise if a search involving use of a medical technique, even of the most rudimentary sort, were made by other than medical personnel or in other than a medical environment"").  given our conclusion that the bag should not have been removed without a judicial warrant, however, we need not resolve in this case the question of what method would be reasonable for lawfully extracting something from an individual's body cavity.while there was heightened probable cause to believe that the bag protruding from the defendant's rectum contained contraband, it was seized without a judicial warrant in circumstances that do not justify failure to obtain one.  consequently, the motionpage 863to suppress should have been allowed.  the judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.so ordered.",criminal,Peter B.

""although a union has the power to waive statutory rights related to collective activity, rights . . . which are of a personal, and not merely economic, nature are beyond the union's ability to bargain away.""  blanchette v. school comm. of westwood,, 183 (1998) (protections of antidiscrimination law, g. l. c. 151b, not waivable through collective bargaining).  the wage act rights at issue here fall into this category:  ""the statutory right to the timely payment of wages does not involve the collective rights of employees but, rather, is designed to insure that each individual is paid promptly the wages due him or her.""  newton, supra at 346.no massachusetts appellate decision has ever upheld the waiver of individual statutory rights through a cba.  in newton, even though the cba included provisions concerning overtime, call-back,page 870stand-by pay, and a grievance procedure ""relating to the interpretation and application of the terms of the agreement,"" we held that the agreement did not waive the plaintiffs' ""right to the timely payment of wages"" under the wage act.  ibid.  ""while an individual may waive the requirements of the statute by a writing, the record does not disclose that the plaintiffs did so.  nor does their collective bargaining agreement include any reference to g. l. c. 149, § 148, or to the time when wages must be paid.""  id. at 345.the united states supreme court, in barrentine v. arkansas-best freight sys., 450 u.s. 728, 745 (1981), similarly held that the grievance procedures of a cba could not waive an individual employee's right to bring an action in federal court alleging a violation of the minimum wage provision of the fair labor standards act (flsa).  the court stated that employees' rights under the flsa ""devolve on petitioners as individual workers, not as members of a collective organization.  they are not waivable.""  ibid.more recently, in a sharply divided decision, the united states supreme court held for the first time that federal law permits enforcement of a provision in a cba that compels arbitration of individual employees' statutory age discrimination claims, but only by way of ""a provision . . . that clearly and unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate claims arising under the age discrimination in employment act of 1967.""  14 penn plaza llc v. pyett, 556 u.s. 247, 251 (2009).  the court distinguished barrentine on the ground that ""the arbitration provision under review in barrentine did not expressly reference the statutory claim at issue.""  id. at 263.we need not determine whether massachusetts law permits a union to waive represented employees' rights and remedies under the wage actbecause we conclude that the cbas before us do not include such a waiver.  the commonwealth's fundamental public policy ""to provide strong statutory protection for employees and their right to wages,"" crocker, 464 mass. at 13, would require, at the minimum, a clear and unmistakable waiver.  the cbas here do not meet this high standard.the case of warfield v. beth israel deaconess med. center, inc.,(2009), like the case before us, considered thepage 871specificity necessary to waive judicial enforcement of an important public policy protection.  the question in warfield was whether a clause in an individual's employment agreement providing for arbitration of ""[a]ny claim, controversy or dispute arising out of or in connection with"" the contract applied to an employment discrimination claim under g. l. c. 151b.  warfield, supra at 392.  both the federal arbitration act (faa) and the massachusetts arbitration act explicitly permit written agreements to submit to arbitration any controversy between the parties.  id. at 394-395.  moreover, federal law allows for arbitration of federal employment discrimination disputes, and the court assumed without deciding that massachusetts law likewise would permit arbitration of employment discrimination claims under g. l. c. 151b.  warfield, supra at 395.  in addition, both federal and state law and policy favor arbitration, creating a rebuttable presumption of arbitrability.  id. at 396.nonetheless, relying on the commonwealth's ""overriding governmental policy proscribing various types of discrimination, set forth in g. l. c. 151b,"" warfield, supra at 398, quoting from massachusetts bay transp. authy. v. boston carmen's union, local 589,, 26, 29 (2009), the court held that ""an employment contract containing an agreement by the employee to limit or waive any of the rights or remedies conferred by g. l. c. 151b is enforceable only if such an agreement is stated in clear and unmistakable terms.""  warfield, supra.similarly in blanchette, 427 mass. at 183, after determining that the plaintiff's individual judicial remedies could not be waived by her union's collective bargaining agreement, the court considered whether she had waived those remedies by her own actions.  the court assumed that the plaintiff ""may have been able explicitly and voluntarily to waive her right to pursue her statutory civil rights claim in a judicial forum,"" but held that ""there is no evidence that [she] made such an explicit and voluntary waiver.""  id. at 184.page 872finally, in crocker, 464 mass. at 12, the court considered whether a general release agreement made in settlement of an employment dispute could insulate an employer from wage act liability.  resolving the tension between the wage age, which generally prohibits any agreement to circumvent its protections, and ""the contravening public policy favoring the enforceability of general releases,"" id. at 14, the crocker court created a limited exception to the ""special contract"" prohibition.  melia, 462 mass. at 170 (citation omitted).  to protect against the possibility ""that the strong protections afforded by the wage act could be unknowingly frittered away under the cover of a general release in an employer-employee termination agreement,"" the court held that such an agreement ""will be enforceable as to the statutorily provided rights and remedies conferred by the wage act only if [it] is stated in clear and unmistakable terms.""  crocker, supra.  ""in other words, the release must be plainly worded and understandable to the average individual, and it must specifically refer to the rights and claims under the wage act that the employee is waiving.""  ibid.thus, even if massachusetts were to allow a provision of a cba to waive represented employees' individual rights and remedies under the wage act, the fundamental public policy to prevent employees' unwitting waiver of their individual rights would require ""establishing a relatively narrow channel through which waiver of wage act claims can be accomplished,"" id. at 15 -- that is, a clear and unmistakable statement.  the cbas here do not meet this high standard.with respect to the grievance procedure, the cbas state in art. vii, ""only matters involving the question whether the [sheriff] is complying with the written provisions of this agreement shall constitute grievances under this article.""  this provision does not even mention, let alone clearly and unmistakably state, that the employees have waived their rights to judicial enforcement of wage act violations.  see wright v. universal maritime serv. corp., 525 u.s. 70, 80 (1998) (general arbitration clause, providing for arbitration of ""[m]atters under dispute,"" effective as to contractual, but not statutory, claims; ""a union negotiated waiver of employees' statutory right to a judicial forum"" must be ""clear and unmistakable"").even though the unions agreed to an extended period for the timely payment of wages under the wage act, the unions did not waive the employees' wage act remedies with respect to paymentspage 873withheld longer than the negotiated standard permits.  the twenty-five-day payment window is both a provision of the cbas and a requirement that the sheriff must meet to comply with the wage act.""[i]t is . . . well-established that there are certain personal, statutory rights that can be enforced judicially even though they are incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement.  the mere fact that those rights may be created both by contract and by statute and may be violated by the same factual occurrence does not vitiate their distinct and separate nature.""  newton, 62 mass. app. ct. at 346 (citations omitted).  ""[w]e agree with the plaintiffs that the right to timely payment of wages is a distinct, independent statutory right that can be enforced judicially even though the subject matter of overtime . . . is incorporated in the plaintiffs' collective agreement.""  ibid.the cases of machado v. system4 llc,(2015), and dixon v. perry & slesnick, p.c.,(2009), two decisions that enforced individually negotiated agreements to submit wage act claims to arbitration without requiring explicit reference to the wage act in the arbitration clause,are not to the contrary.  neither of those cases concerned a purported waiver of individual rights in a cba, a distinction explicitly relied upon in dixon.  see dixon, supra at 277 & n.8.moreover, both cases reasoned that the arbitration provisions at issue did not implicate the employees' substantive rights under the wage act or ""exempt"" the employer from the wage act's operation, ""but solely dictate[d] the forum in which the plaintiffs' right to recovery will be determined.""  machado, supra at 217-218.  see dixon, supra at 275 & n.5.  here, however, not all of the statutory remedies available to the employees in court would be available to them under the cbas.  the grievance procedure under the cbas is limited ""[o]nly [to] matters involving the questionpage 874whether the [sheriff] is complying with the written provisions of [the cba].""  the cbas do not provide contractual remedies of treble damages or attorney's fees, which are purely wage act terms.  indeed, the sheriff asserts in his brief that ""any alleged violation with respect to the timing of overtime pay would be a violation of that cba provision, and not the wage act,"" and that the plaintiffs ""are not entitled to damages, treble or otherwise, since there is no wage act violation.""even if the cbas were considered ambiguous as to the availability of wage act remedies, that ambiguity alone would demonstrate why an express reference to wage act rights is essential.  the cbas here do not include sufficiently clear and unmistakable language to waive the employees' individual judicial remedies contained in g. l. c. 149, § 150.conclusion.  the plaintiff employees' election, through the cbas and authorized by the wage act, that payment of overtime wages would be considered timely if made ""within twenty-five (25) working days following the month in which such service is performed"" is effective to supplant the wage act's seven-day requirement.  the plaintiffs did not waive their wage act remedies for payment of wages beyond the twenty-five-day period.  accordingly, we vacate the judgment dismissing the plaintiffs' complaint.  the plaintiffs may proceed to enforce their claims for late payment in the superior court under g. l. c. 149, § 150.so ordered.i agree with the majority that the provision of the collective bargaining agreement (cba) setting forth a twenty-five-day time limit for the payment of overtime wages, rather than a seven-day time limit as set forth in the wage act, is enforceable as a ""request[] inpage 875writing to be paid in a different manner,"" exercised by the unions on behalf of the employees.  g. l. c. 149, § 148, as appearing in st. 1960, c. 416.  it follows therefore that any dispute arising out of this provision of the cba must first be pursued within the grievance procedure provided for in the cba.  see azzi v. western elec. co.,, 408 (1985) (before bringing action against employer for violation of cba, employee required to exhaust grievance procedure), citing vaca v. sipes, 386 u.s. 171, 184 (1967).  to the extent that the majority allows employees to elect a judicial remedy in the first instance, bypassing the contractual remedies provided for in the cba, i dissent.the cba provides that ""matters involving the question whether the [sheriff of suffolk county (sheriff)] is complying with the written provisions of this agreement shall constitute grievances"" and sets out a detailed grievance procedure to be followed, ultimately concluding in binding arbitration.  the employees' claim to have not been paid overtime wages within twenty-five days as required by the cba unquestionably falls within the definition of a grievance.  the employees were therefore required to pursue and to exhaust their contractual remedies through the grievance procedure; election of a judicial remedy in the first instance was not permissible.  see malden police patrolman's assn. v. malden,, 59 (2017) (""employees may not simply disregard the grievance procedures set out in a collective labor contract and go direct[ly] to court for redress against the employer""), quoting from balsavich v. local union 170 of the intl. bhd. of teamsters, chauffeurs, warehousemen & helpers of america,, 286 (1976).relying primarily on cases involving claims of employment discrimination,the majority contends that the cba must state in ""clear and unmistakable"" terms that employees waive the right to bring a wage act claim in court for claims arising out of the cba provision requiring overtime wages to be paid within twenty-five days.  ante at 870.  yet, there is a presumption of arbitrability in contracts containing arbitration clauses.  see drywall sys., inc. v.page 876zvi constr. co.,, 666 (2002) (arbitration of particular claim ""should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.  doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage"").  thus, there is no need for the cba to ""list every possible statutory claim that might arise.""  warfield v. beth israel deaconess med. center, inc.,, 400 n.16 (2009).in the employment discrimination cases, the courts were concerned that individual statutory rights to be free from discrimination may be unwittingly waived through general arbitration clauses in agreements making no mention of discrimination.  see id. at 402 (statutory gender discrimination claim could be pursued in court, despite arbitration clause in employment contract, where there was ""no contractual term dealing with discrimination"").  that concern is not present here where the claim arises out of an explicit term of the cba concerning the time period within which overtime wages must be paid.additionally, the rationale for not applying the presumption of arbitrability in employment discrimination cases has no applicability here.  see wright v. universal maritime serv. corp., 525 u.s. 70, 78-79 (1998) (noting that presumption of arbitrability is rooted in rationale that arbitrators are in better position than courts to interpret terms of cbas, court explained that presumption does not have force in employment discrimination context where arbitrator would be called upon to interpret discrimination statutes).  the claim in this case does not require arbitrators to interpret the wage act but, rather, to interpret the cba as negotiated by the parties.moreover, the clear and unmistakable standard has never been required to permit wage act claims to be submitted to arbitration.  to the contrary, in machado v. system4 llc,, 216-217 (2015), the court considered a broad arbitration clause that required any claim arising out of the parties' franchise relationship to be submitted to arbitration.relying on crocker v. townsend oil co.,(2012), as the majority does here, the plaintiffs argued that their wage act claims were not arbitrablepage 877because the arbitration clause made no mention of the wage act.  machado, supra.  rejecting this argument, the court explained that an arbitration agreement ""does not permit an employer to thwart or exempt itself from wage act obligations, but solely dictates the forum in which the plaintiffs' right to recovery will be determined.""id. at 217-218.  thus, despite the absence of clear and unmistakable language indicating waiver of a judicial forum for wage act claims, the plaintiffs were required to submit their claims to arbitration as provided in the cba.  see dixon v. perry & slesnick, p.c.,, 275-276 (2009) (wage act claim required to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to general arbitration clause with no reference to wage act).given that the provision of the cba setting forth a twenty-five-day time limit for the payment of overtime wages is enforceable, any claim that the sheriff violated this provision must be resolved, in the first instance, through the mechanism provided for in the cba.  i would affirm the judgment in its entirety.i, like my dissenting colleague, also agree with the majority that the twenty-five-day time limit for the payment of overtime wages is enforceable as a ""request[] in writing to be paid in a different manner"" than the seven-day payment requirement contained in the wage act.  see g. l. c. 149, § 148, as appearing in st. 1960, c. 416.  however, i do not believe it was necessary to ""harmonize the wage act with c. 150e"" as the majority holds.  ante at 868.  collective bargaining agreements (cbas) are not the kind of contracts from which the wage act was attempting to protect workers.,see rooney v. yarmouth,, 492-494 (1991); crocker v. townsend oil co.,, 13-15 (2012).i dissent, however, from the majority holding that employees subject to the cba may elect to enforce its provision for the payment of overtime wages by employing the judicial remedy contained in the wage act.  ante at 869.  the appropriate forum for the remedy is arbitration, as stated in the cba.in 1974, the town of yarmouth (town) voted to accept the provisions of g. l. c. 41, § 108l (the quinn bill).rooney, supra at 487.  sometime after the town's acceptance, the town and the union representing police officers adopted § 108l as a provision of their cba, including ""[a]mendments passed by the state legislature, now and in the future.""  rooney, supra at 487 n.2.the rooney court determined that the parties intended to make § 108l part of, and subject to, the cba.  id. at 491.  when a dispute arose concerning the payment of certain salary increases, an employee police officer claimed that he was not required to arbitrate the dispute because g. l. c. 41, § 108l (i.e., statutory rights) and constitutional rights regarding property rights through 42 u.s.c. § 1983 were involved.  rooney, supra at 490.  the employee police officer insisted that he was entitled to a judicialpage 879remedy and that even if the dispute were arbitrable under the cba, arbitration would not be an exclusive remedy.  ibid.  his failure to pursue arbitration would thus not justify a dismissal of the action.  ibid.  the rooney court held:""[section] 108l does not vest in [the employee] a personal, substantive, nonwaivable statutory guarantee that he is free to enforce judicially notwithstanding the incorporation of § 108l into the [cba]. . . .  [the employee] plainly does not have in § 108l an independent statutory right that is unencompassed by the [cba]. . . .  we conclude that, by agreeing to the incorporation of § 108l into the [cba], the union effectively waived any right [the employee] may have had to judicial relief based on § 108l.  [the employee's] exclusive remedy . . . was through the grievance process provided in the agreement.""id. at 492, 494.here, as the majority would agree, there was no attempted waiver by the cba of the statutory right to timely payment of overtime wages.  the cba merely, as specifically allowed by the wage act, determined what the period of time would be for the prompt payment of overtime wages for the employees covered by the cba.the cases cited by the majority to support the proposition that this case represents a situation of a nonwaivable right are inapposite.  see blanchette v. school comm. of westford,, 183 (1998) (protections of g. l. c. 151b [anti-discrimination law] cannot be waived through cba); warfield v. beth israel deaconess med. center, inc.,, 398 (2009) (applied arbitration requirement to employment discrimination claim under g. l. c. 151b; ""an agreement by the employee to limit or waive any of the rights or remedies conferred by g. l. c. 151b is enforceable if such an agreement is stated in clear and unmistakable terms""); crocker, 464 mass. at 14 (arbitration, pursuant topage 880agreement, ""will be enforceable as to the statutorily provided rights and remedies conferred by the wage act only if such an agreement is stated in clear and unmistakable terms""); barrentine v. arkansas-best freight sys., 450 u.s. 728, 737-744 (1981) (right to minimum wage and overtime pay cannot be waived through a cba); wright v. universal maritime serv. corp., 525 u.s. 70 (1998) (""union negotiated waiver of employees' statutory right to a judicial forum"" in general arbitration clause must be ""clear and unmistakable"").and, finally, the majority misunderstands the holding in newton v. commissioner of the dept. of youth servs.,(2004).  in newton, employees of a department of youth services (dys) forestry camp brought an action against dys under the wage act for failure to pay overtime and for other extra pay.  id. at 344.  unlike our case, while the dys employees were subject to a cba and its arbitration clause, the cba made no mention of the wage act or of any of its specific requirements.  id. at 345.  the court held that, ""[w]hile an individual may waive the requirements of the statute by a writing, the record does not disclose that the plaintiffs did so.  nor does their collective bargaining agreement include any reference to g. l. c. 149, § 148,"" (emphasis supplied).  newton, supra.the wage act allowed the inclusion of the provision of the cba at issue here, and the majority agrees with this.  ante at 869.  the twenty-five-day payment requirement contained in the cba exists only in the cba and not in the wage act.  the cba does not and cannot amend the wage act.  the twenty-five-day payment requirement created by, and existing only in, the cba can be enforced only within the forum (i.e., arbitration) provided in the cba.",civil,None,affirm
1712,allison st. laurent & anothervs.  middleborough gas & electric department.,"municipal corporations, municipal electric plant, governmental immunity.  middleborough.  massachusetts tort claims act.  statute, construction.","middleborough gas & electric department (mged) appeals from a superior court order denying its motion to dismiss for lack of presentment.  the motion judge denied the motion on the ground that mged is not a ""public employer"" subject to the massachusetts tort claims act, and thus the presentment requirement of g. l. c. 258, § 4, did not apply.  we disagree and remand so that the superior court can address whether the presentment requirement was satisfied on the facts here.1.  background.the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs were injured in october, 2013, when a ladder they were near came into contact with an ""arc[ing]"" electrical current.  they claim that the current came from an ""improperly grounded"" line maintained by mged, and that mged was negligent.  between november, 2013, and july, 2015, and prior to filing suit, the plaintiffs' attorney communicated with representatives of mged multiple times, both orally and in writing.  eventually efforts at presuit resolution failed, and the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit on april 19, 2016.mged filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs had failed to make presentment as required by the massachusetts tort claims act, g. l. c. 258, § 4.  the plaintiffs responded (1) that no presentment was required because mged is not a ""public employer"" as defined in g. l. c. 258, § 1, as amended by st. 1993, c. 110, § 227, and thus the tort claims act does not apply and (2) that in any event the plaintiffs had satisfied the presentment requirement through correspondence with representatives of mged.  the motion judge denied mged's motion on the ground that mged was not a public employer, but rather was a ""commercial business.""2.  discussion.  the question before us turns on the definition of ""public employer,"" found at c. 258, § 1, which provides that ""public employer"" includes ""any . . . town . . . and any department . . . thereof . . . including a municipal gaspage 902or electric plant.""  in construing a statute we begin with its plain language, and we think the language here admits of only one interpretation.  see commonwealth v. stewart-johnson,, 600 (2011) (""a statute is to be interpreted according to the plain and ordinary meaning of its words"" [quotation omitted]).  mged is a department of the town of middleborough, and it is a ""gas or electric plant.""  it squarely meets the statutory definition.the plaintiffs urge us to reach a contrary result based upon other language in the ""public employer"" definition that excludes ""the massachusetts port authority, or any otherbody politic and corporate"" (emphasis added).  see g. l. c. 258, § 1.  the plaintiffs argue that mged is one such ""independent"" entity.  they rely in particular on a supreme judicial court decision, middleborough v. middleborough gas & elec. dept.,, 587-588 (1996), that dealt specifically with mged, and in which the court held that the town of middleborough and mged could be treated as sufficiently separate so that the town could sue mged for losses from a fire it allegedly caused.neither middleborough nor the cases that succeed it support the position that the defendant gas and electric plant is not a ""public employer"" under the tort claims act.  in middleborough, 422 mass. at 588, the supreme judicial court expressly stated that it was not deciding whether the tort claims act applied in suits against mged.  furthermore, the court specifically noted that the amendment to the ""public employer"" definition that we rely upon here, adding gas and electric plants, postdated the cause of action at issue in middleborough.  see ibid.  subsequently, in deroche v. massachusetts commn. against discrimination,, 10 (2006), the supreme judicial court held that the wakefield municipal gas & light department was a ""public entity"" for purposes of a different massachusetts statute.  in so holding the court relied, in part, on the fact that ""[t]he legislature has specifically placed the [gas and light] department in the class of entities subject to the tort claims act, thereby reflecting its view that the department is in that class of entities afforded the protections of sovereign immunity.""  ibid.  the court went on to consider and distinguish the middleborough decision, concluding that ""as a legal and practical matter, the [gas and electric] department is a department of the town and, like the town, is a public entity.""  id. at 11.we conclude likewise here.  in construing the term ""public employer"" in g. l. c. 258, § 1, we cannot read the language excluding ""other independent bod[ies]"" to override the inclusion of ""municipal gas or electric plant[s].""  see commonwealth v. burgess,, 224-225 (1997), quoting from united states v. menasche, 348 u.s. 528, 538-539 (1955) (""one of the cardinal principles of statutory construction is to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute"").  moreover, to the extent that the two clauses might be said to conflict, the exclusion, which is general, must yield to the inclusion, which is specific.  see tbi, inc. v. board of health of n. andover,, 18 (2000), quoting from risk mgmt. foundation of harvard med. insts., inc. v. commissioner of ins.,, 505 (1990) (""[g]eneral statutory language must yield to that which is more specific"").  see also doe v. attorney gen. (no. 1),,page 903215 (1997) (""[w]hen two statutes [or provisions within those statutes] conflict, we have stated that the more specific provision, particularly where it has been enacted subsequent to a more general rule, applies over the general rule"").accordingly, mged is a ""public employer"" subject to the tort claims act.  that leaves, on remand, the question whether the presentment requirement was nevertheless satisfied on the facts of this case -- in particular, through the correspondence between the plaintiffs' counsel and mged's representatives.  that issue was not reached by the motion judge, and we do not reach it here.the order denying the motion to dismiss is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.so ordered.nicholas j. scobbo, jr., for the defendant.dana alan curhan for the plaintiffs.",civil,None,affirm

[10-11]","the plaintiffs, h. christopher starkey and louisa h. starkey, entered into a mortgage loan transaction in which they executed a promissory note in favor of washington mutual bank, fa (washington mutual), as lender and payee in the amount of $1,000,000, on november 22, 2005, and gave washington mutual a mortgage on their residential real property in south yarmouth.  the plaintiffs ultimately fell behind on their mortgage payments.  on may 14, 2009, deutsche bank national trust company (deutsche bank), as trustee for wamu mortgage pass through certificates series 2006-ar1 trust (trust), brought a ""complaint to foreclose mortgage"" against the plaintiffs under the servicemembers civil relief act, as a final step prior to initiating the process of foreclosure through publication.  on june 10 and june 15, 2009, the plaintiffs sent ""notice[s] of rescission"" to deutsche bank as trustee of the trust, in which they claimed the right to rescind the november 22, 2005, transactions.  after receiving no response, they filed their november, 2009, complaint in the instant action in superior court, naming as defendants deutsche bank, as trustee for the trust; jpmorgan chase bank, n.a. (jpmorgan chase), successor in interest to washington mutual; and other entities related to jpmorgan chase or washington mutual.  the plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, damages, and rescission of the mortgage and note, alleging that the defendants have no enforceable rights with respect to the mortgage and note due to their failure to properly convey these assets into the trust (count 1), that the note and mortgage were obtained without disclosures mandated by g. l. c. 140d (count 2), that the plaintiffs werepage 3fraudulently induced to sign the mortgage and note (count 3), that the defendants breached their contract with the plaintiffs by refusing to allow the plaintiffs to rescind the mortgage loan (count 4), that the defendants violated the real estate settlement procedures act, 12 u.s.c. §§ 2601-2617 (2006) (count 5), that the defendants violated the consumer protection statute, g. l. c. 93a (count 6), and that the defendants violated the borrower's interest statute, g. l. c. 183, § 28c (a) (count 7).the defendants filed motions to dismiss in january, 2010.  in their memoranda in support of the motions to dismiss, the defendants did not raise any argument that dismissal was required by the financial institutions reform, recovery, and enforcement act of 1989 (firrea), pub. l. 101-73, 103 stat. 183, the relevant portions of which are codified at 12 u.s.c. § 1821(c)-(l) (2006).  however, at argument on the motions, without prior notice to the plaintiffs, the defendants presented the judge with a copy of demelo v. u.s. bank nat'l ass'n, 727 f.3d 117 (1st cir. 2013), and argued that firrea, as construed by demelo, required dismissal of the suit.the motion judge ordered the dismissal of all but one claim in the complaint -- count 5 as against jpmorgan chase -- solely on the basis of firrea.  at the first opportunity to address that statute, after the decision was rendered, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing the inapplicability of firrea.  that motion was denied the same day it was filed.  eventually the remaining count 5 claim was resolved by mutual agreement and dismissed by separate judgment.  a second judgment then entered dismissing counts 1 through 4, 6, and 7, on the basis of firrea.  before us now is the plaintiffs' timely appeal from that judgment (as corrected to remedy a clerical mistake).on appeal the only issue before us is whether firrea requires dismissal of these counts.  in light of the procedural history described, we think the plaintiffs' arguments were adequately raised below.additional relevant facts will be described in the course of our discussion below.analysis.  on september 25, 2008, washington mutual bank, formerly washington mutual bank, fa,was declared insolvent and placed into receivership of the federal deposit insurance corporation (fdic).  see thompson v. washington mut., 806 f. supp.page 42d 197, 199 (d.d.c. 2011).  its assets were immediately sold to defendant jpmorgan chase.  firrea sets forth a claims procedure that requires creditors of failed banks to file claims with the fdic, and divests courts of jurisdiction to hear these claims against these banks, or the fdic as receiver, until administrative remedies with the fdic have been exhausted.  specifically, the statute provides,""except as provided in this subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction over--""(i) any claim or action for payment from, or any action seeking a determination of rights with respect to, the assets of any depository institution for which the corporation [i.e., the fdic] has been appointed receiver, including assets which the corporation may acquire from itself as such receiver; or""(ii) any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the corporation as receiver.""12 u.s.c. § 1821(d)(13)(d).  the defendants argue that the statute bars the plaintiffs' claims because it eliminates the trial court's jurisdiction, and that the plaintiffs are remitted to the claim procedure set forth in firrea, under which the deadline for filing claims has now passed.  see alkasabi v. washington mut. bank, f.a., 31 f. supp. 3d 101, 104 (d.d.c. 2014) (fdic set december 30, 2008, as deadline for filing claims against the washington mutual receivership).procedural setting.  as an initial matter, in their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that their mortgage was ""apparently"" held by ""washington mutual, inc., or one of its subsidiaries"" on the date of washington mutual's insolvency.  they alleged that they were not informed that anyone other than the original mortgagee, washington mutual, held their mortgage loan prior to their receipt of the trust's complaint to foreclose mortgage.  the notion that the mortgage loan was held by washington mutual on the date of its placement in receivership (september 25, 2008) was certainly a reasonable inference, since, three days before bringing the may 14, 2009, complaint to foreclose mortgage, the trust was purportedly assigned the mortgage by jpmorgan chase.  the assignment was signed by barbara hindman, vice-president of jpmorgan chase, recorded in the barnstable registry of deeds on may 20, 2009, and accompanied by an affidavit by the fdic stating thatpage 5jpmorgan chase came to own all of washington mutual's ""loans and loan commitments"" on september 25, 2008.although the memoranda in support of the defendants' motions to dismiss, filed by a single attorney purporting to represent all the defendants, including jpmorgan chase and the trust, did nothing to clarify the question of who owned the note and the mortgage at what times, the plaintiffs did append to an opposition memorandum a copy of the ""pooling and servicing agreement"" (psa), an agreement between wamu asset acceptance corp. as depositor of a set of assets (primarily mortgage loans), washington mutual bank as servicer of those loans, deutsche bank as trustee of the trust, and deutsche bank trust company delaware as delaware trustee.  its inclusion suggests that the mortgage was securitized and sold to the trust long before washington mutual's insolvency.  that document reveals that the trust obtained all its assets through a purchase from wamu asset acceptance corp., the set of assets being valued at over $1.5 billion.  the psa states that those assets include ""mortgage loans"" that would be conveyed to the trust on the closing date, january 30, 2006.  ""mortgage loan[]"" is relevantly defined to include both the note and the mortgage.  according to the psa, the ""mortgage files,"" which include the mortgage notes and recorded mortgages, endorsed or assigned respectively either in blank, to the trust, or to the trustee, were also to be delivered to the trust on january 30, 2006.  the trust then issued a variety of classes of ""certificates,"" each representing a fractional ownership interest in the bundle of mortgage loans that made up the trust assets, and the certificates were subsequently sold on the open market.  the psa appears to make no provision, and appears to grant the trust no authority, for acquisition of additional assets by the trust subsequent to the closing date.arguing that firrea bars the plaintiffs' claims if the mortgage was owned by washington mutual on the date of its placement in receivership, the defendants now contend that because the plaintiffs, understandably in light of the defendants' own conduct, pleaded that the mortgage was ""apparently"" owned by washington mutual on that date, the plaintiffs have ""pled themselves out of court.""at this stage in the proceedings, however, we need not determine what claims or actions might be barred by firrea with respect to assets owned by washington mutual on the date it went into receivership.  that is because the judge, appropriately, consideredpage 6the psa in ruling on the motions to dismiss, specifically concluding that ""[t]he mortgage was quickly packaged into a security sold to deutsche bank.""  the judge thus implicitly treated the motions as ones for summary judgment under mass. r. civ. p. 56,  365 mass. 824  (1974), rather than as motions to dismiss under mass. r. civ. p. 12 (b) (6),  365 mass. 754  (1974).  see mass. r. civ. p. 12 (b) (""if, on any motion asserting the defense numbered [6], to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment . . ."").  accord cousineau v. laramee,, 860 n.2 (1983) (trial judge who relies on factual matters outside the pleadings in deciding a rule 12 [b] [6] motion implicitly converts that motion into one for summary judgment).on appeal, we therefore do the same.  our review is de novo.  bulwer v. mount auburn hosp.,, 680 (2016).  drawing every inference from the record in favor of the nonmoving parties, the plaintiffs, we must determine whether there is any genuine issue of material fact and whether, as a matter of law, the defendants are entitled to judgment.  id.  see miller v. cotter,, 676 (2007).discussion.  as our description of the proceedings below suggests, there is, at least, a genuine issue of fact with respect to the ownership of the plaintiffs' mortgage loan in 2008.  if, as the psa suggests, the note and the mortgage were sold to the trust in 2006, they were no longer assets of washington mutual on the day it went into receivership.  both the note and the mortgage would have been the property of the trust since 2006, notwithstanding the transfer document recorded in may, 2009.in a suit against a purchaser of a loan from a depository institution that later became insolvent and went into receivership of the fdic, the first clause of 12 u.s.c. § 1821(d)(13)(d) is inapplicable.  such a suit does not seek ""payment from, or . . . a determination of rights with respect to, the assets of any depository institution for which the [fdic] has been appointed receiver.""  the question before us is whether such a suit is barred by the second clause, eliminating jurisdiction over ""any claim relating to any act or omission of such institution or the [fdic] as receiver.""  12 u.s.c. § 1821(d)(13)(d)(ii).""in firrea, the word 'claim' is a term-of-art that refers only to claims that are resolvable through the firrea administrativepage 7process, and the only claims that are resolvable through the administrative process are claims against a depository institution for which the fdic is receiver.""  american nat'l ins. co. v. federal deposit ins. corp., 642 f.3d 1137, 1142 (d.c. cir. 2011).  this understanding of the scope of the word ""claim"" accords with the purposes of firrea, which are ""to ensure that the assets of a failed institution are distributed fairly and promptly among those with valid claims against the institution, and to expeditiously wind up the affairs of failed banks.""  mccarthy v. federal deposit ins. corp., 348 f.3d 1075, 1079 (9th cir. 2003), quoting freeman v. federal deposit ins. corp., 56 f.3d 1394, 1401 (d.c. cir. 1995).  see marquis v. federal deposit ins. corp., 965 f.2d 1148, 1154 (1st cir. 1992) (""firrea was designed to create an efficient administrative protocol for processing claims against failed banks""); rosa v. resolution trust corp., 938 f.2d 383, 396 (3d cir. 1991) (purpose of firrea's administrative procedure is to ""quickly and efficiently resolve claims against a failed institution without resorting to litigation"").courts have required the use of the administrative claims procedure for claims against third-party banks that purchased the assets of the failed bank from the fdic as receiver and assumed its rights and/or liabilities from the fdic -- the purchasing bank in this case is jpmorgan chase -- when those claims are ""functionally,"" if not ""formally,"" against the failed bank.  see, e.g., tellado v. indymac mtge. servs., 707 f.3d 275, 280-281 (3d cir. 2013); benson v. jpmorgan chase bank, n.a., 673 f.3d 1207, 1214 (9th cir. 2012); aber-shukofsky v. jpmorgan chase & co., 755 f. supp. 2d 441, 448 (e.d.n.y. 2010).  in those cases, the suit was functionally against the failed bank because the purchasing bank held, at the time of the suit, the assets that the firrea claims process was designed to distribute, and a contrary rule would allow plaintiffs to circumvent the required process simply by naming the purchasing bank rather than the failed bank as the defendant.  see, e.g., american nat'l ins. co., supra at 1144; benson, supra at 1214.  this was the case with the defendant bank in demelo v. u.s. bank nat'l ass'n, 727 f.3d 117 (1st cir. 2013), relied on by the defendants here.consistent with the purposes of the statute, though, in demelo the united states court of appeals for the first circuit impliedpage 8that the firrea bar applies only to holders of mortgages originally issued by the failed bank when those mortgages were ""acquired . . . by way of the powers vested in the fdic under firrea.""  id. at 124.  see american first fed., inc. v. lake forest park, inc., 198 f.3d 1259, 1263 n.3 (11th cir. 1999) (""[the bank], having purchased the note from the [fdic], stands in the shoes of the [fdic] and acquires its protected status under firrea"").  in other circumstances, the assignee will have whatever ""successor liability"" comes with the assigned mortgage.  demelo, supra.  this is the approach taken by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in bank of n.y. v. first millennium, inc., 607 f.3d 905 (2d cir. 2010).  in that case, a trust created by a bank, nextbank, purchased some assets from nextbank before it failed.  the trust then issued notes backed by proceeds from the assets, which notes it subsequently sold.  after nextbank failed, the fdic and various noteholders each claimed the right to certain proceeds -- the noteholders under the notes, and the fdic as receiver for the trust's creator.  the trust interpleaded the fdic and the noteholders to resolve the dispute.  id. at 908-910.  the fdic argued that the case was barred by firrea.  id. at 920.  the second circuit rejected this argument because, although it concluded the case involved claims related to an ""act or omission"" of the fdic, the claims at issue were only against the solvent trust - not against the failed bank or the fdic as receiver.  since such claims could not have been brought under the administrative procedures of 12 u.s.c. § 1821(d), firrea did not bar them:""this interpleader . . . is not an administrative claim, nor could it have been one.  the noteholders are not creditors of nextbank, and they assert no claims against either that failed institution or against the fdic.  they hold notes issued by the trust, an independent and still solvent entity.  accordingly, since they assert no claims against the fdic as receiver for nextbank, they are not bound by the jurisdictional limitations or other procedural requirements of § 1821(d).""while the plain language of . . . § 1821(d)(13)(d)(ii)[] may initially appear helpful to the fdic's argument, closer examination reveals it to be irrelevant.  section 1821(d)(13)(d)(ii) states:  '[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subsection, no court shall have jurisdiction over . . . any claim relating to any act or omission of [an] institution [in receivership] or thepage 9[fdic] as receiver.'  read out of context, this provision may seem to deprive courts of jurisdiction over any claim involving the fdic's 'act or omission,' even a claim not directly against the fdic.  such an interpretation would be erroneous.  this provision is not an isolated edict, but is part of firrea's statutory scheme, which was intended to force plaintiffs with claims against failed depository institutions to exhaust administrative remedies before coming to [f]ederal court.  carlyle towers [condominium ass'n, inc. v. federal deposit ins. corp.], 170 f.3d [301,] 307 [(2d cir. 1999)].  courts interpreting the broad language of § 1821(d)(13)(d)(ii) have universally concluded that this provision bars only claims that could be brought under the administrative procedures of § 1821(d), not any claim at all involving the fdic.  see auction co. of am. v. fdic, 141 f.3d 1198, 1201 (d.c. cir. 1998) (holding that § 1821[d][13][d][ii] grants the fdic immunity only from claims that can be brought through the administrative processes of § 1821[d]); hudson united bank v. chase manhattan bank of conn., n.a., 43 f.3d 843, 849 (3d cir. 1994) ('the purpose [of firrea] was not to immunize certain claims from review.').  we agree with their conclusion.  accordingly, since the noteholders assert no claim against either the fdic or nextbank, and since they are not compelled to comply with the administrative procedures of § 1821(d), § 1821(d)(13)(d)(ii) [does not] bar[] their claims . . . .""bank of n.y., supra at 920-921.we find that reading of firrea persuasive.  and indeed, although the reasoning of various courts in construing this provision of firrea varies, we are aware of no case in which a court has held that firrea eliminates jurisdiction over a claim such as this -- against a solvent third party that is not the failed bank, the fdic, or a successor that obtained assets of the failed bank from the fdic -- for either money damages that the third party will be required itself to pay, or for declaratory or injunctive relief.except to the extent, if any, that the plaintiffs seek money damages from washington mutual, or arguably jpmorgan chasepage 10as the bank that assumed its rights and/or liabilities from the fdic, then, we conclude their claims are not barred by firrea.  to the extent there exists any dispute by the defendants about the ownership of the note or the mortgage on the date washington mutual went into receivership --and we note that date of preparation or recordation of a mortgage transfer does not necessarily indicate that that is the date on which ownership of the mortgage was in fact transferred to a purchaser -- the plaintiffs are entitled to further discovery on the matter.the plaintiffs also argue that, even if the mortgage loan was owned by washington mutual on the date of receivership or firrea otherwise applied, some or all of their claims would survive because they do not fall within the language of the statute as properly construed, in particular because declaratory judgments and affirmative defenses do not fall under firrea's definition of ""claim.""  see bolduc v. beal bank, ssb, 167 f.3d 667, 671-672 (1st cir. 1999) (preemptive assertion of affirmative defense to foreclosure action not barred by firrea).  see also, e.g., beaton v. land court,, 392 (1975) (fraud is defense to foreclosure).  in light of our holding, and the fact that the motion judge was presented with the firrea argument only at the hearing on the motions to dismiss, so that these issues werepage 11not fully briefed before the motions were initially decided, we think the prudent course is to allow the superior court to address these issues on remand in the first instance, should it become necessary.the corrected judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the superior court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.so ordered.",civil,0.0,0.0
