## Directory structure

1. opinions_data.zip: Zipped folder that contains the scraped data in JSON. If the next group wants 
to utilize the data and transform it in their own way, they can use this. Otherwise the csv files would suffice.
2. Previous gp : data collected by the [previous gp]()
3. opinions_data_csv : contains our data formatted for our analysis
