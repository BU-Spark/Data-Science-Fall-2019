"""
To solve this problem, we use the government department name list. 
At first, we found out those news containing a department name in press release news which often means that it contains a key event in the news of certain date. 
By manually searching for the key events, we know what it is. Then, we search the mainstream media news for the same events to decide whether the coverage of key event or agenda in press release generates media coverage or awareness. The phrase I chose is 3 days, considering the timeliness of news. 
It means that we have to check if the mainstream media has the same coverage in three days after the coverage in press release.
