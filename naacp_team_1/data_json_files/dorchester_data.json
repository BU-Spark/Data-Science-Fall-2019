(patrick ultimately approved five — one commutation and four pardons, the only ones of his two terms.) but upon taking office, baker immediately rescinded the guidelines patrick put in place, saying he intended to release his own. as of last week, they were still “being developed,” according to browne, meaning applications, including holdovers, would remain on hold. “it’s always helpful to know before you apply, are you including the right stuff? are you even eligible?” said leslie walker, the executive director of prisoners’ legal services. “that is discouraging people because there are no guidelines.” and if they were, it’s unclear if baker would move quickly on them. pardons are often viewed as politically prickly, particularly in massachusetts, and they’ve often been left to a governor’s final days, if at all. acting gov. jane swift approved seven in her final year, and gov. romney — who, of course, carried national aspirations as he left the state house — didn’t sign off on any. “i’ve heard people have written letters asking that the guidelines be established,” walker said. “but we’re nine months into the administration. it’s a political third rail.” the number of applications for pardons and commutations — known as clemency petitions — has ebbed and flowed over the past decade, depending on which governor is in office. mitt romney 2005: 59 2006: 49 deval patrick 2007: 131 2008: 109 2009: 92 2010: 80 2011: 65 2012: 65 2013: 48 2014: 347 charlie baker 2015: 47* * through friday as baker toured an mbta staging area in dorchester last week — talking (the real) third rails, traction motors and commuter rail branches — the wonky republican seemed at home in the t weeds. “got that?” he asked reporters after one figure-filled exchange. “this has, like, been our lives for the past six months or so.” so, perhaps, it’s not surprising to see baker take a break. as he made the rounds — “winter resiliency” was a popular topic — he stopped to talk to steve maher, a foreman on site, and tom russo. “what year did you graduate?” maher could be heard asking baker. in 1975, the governor responded. “i played against you,” maher said. and so for the next few minutes, the two former high school football rivals — maher played for dedham, baker for needham — talked the old days and the three-point stance. “it’s showing our age,” maher told baker. as baker departed, maher was asked if he could recall the 6-foot-6 governor on the field. “he couldn’t have been that good,” maher joked. “i don’t remember him.”    "}

what percentage along are you?’ i think maybe the advocates at the time gave a much rosier projection than was the case. whether it rises to the level of misleading the federal government, i’m not sure. but if there was some wrongdoing here, it might give the federal government the opportunity to say, ‘well, those federal funds were obtained through fraud,’ and demand repayment,” lynch said. “look, there are laws out there. if it rises to the level of criminality, a felony, then those people will have to pay the price. what was worse in terms of what i read is that one of the contractors was actually fired because they would not green-light it and they were asking the right questions. that is more egregious than willing ignorance, i guess.” lynch called the recently shuffling of the top deck at boston 2024 “an improvement” and “fresh start” for the city’s bid to host the 2024 summer olympics — a move he said he told mayor martin j. walsh was overdue. “there’s a sporting component of the olympics,” lynch said, “but there’s also a construction part, there’s a security part, there’s a transportation part ... there’s also a finance part. so i thought that the approach that we might take — and i suggested this to the mayor — would be to bring in mitt romney, bring in mike dukakis. i mean, i know a lot of people don’t like him, but he is a stone-cold expert on transportation. bring in katherine craven, who’s done a wonderful job with housing for these universities. she’s been incredible. bring in people from all these disciplines. maybe an ed davis on security, and ask them to serve for a dollar. just for a dollar. do this for a dollar to serve this effort. i think it might bring people’s emotions a little less antagonistic to the olympics and might start a new day. “i don’t think necessarily that choosing larry bird and jo jo white and david ortiz was the comfort that people were looking for. we’re really looking at the fiscal aspect of this and the managerial aspect of this. and while they’re very popular — they’re wonderful people — i don’t think they’ll be providing that level of assurance that will adjust people’s fears.” asked if he considered it a setback for boston 2024 that no concrete spending plan has been made public, lynch said incoming chairman steve pagliuca, co-owner of the celtics, and philanthropist jack connors, who will serve as an advisor, “know the pressure’s on, and i’m sure they’ll try to address some of those questions as quickly as possible, but i haven’t had a chance to talk to either one of them and i’m not sure what the timeline is.” bringing pagliuca on board is “a step in the right direction. i’m not sure it’s enough,” he said. “i think people want to know if the cost overruns occur, who pays? what’s the process? it’s an insurable event, so is there some type of reinsurance that if this doesn’t happen or that doesn’t happen, we have a policy we can rely on. i don’t know how they structure it, but that’s why we have all these smart people in place.” lynch called a potential 60,000-seat olympic stadium in andrew square in south boston “the elephant in the room. i’m not in favor of that. they’re saying they’re going to build that 60,000-seat stadium and then take it down. i find that hard to believe. i think the neighborhoods of the south end, roxbury, dorchester and south boston are all concerned about that stadium because that’s a huge impact on that area. and it’s an area that’s coming up now. it’s really been transformed over the last 10 years. “i still am not convinced that that can work in that location. there was some other talk about suffolk downs because they’ve lost so much business there. the blue line is inadequate to service the needs of an olympic stadium in that area, but that would be a perfect opportunity to really rebuild and redo the blue line to service that entire community. “i think east boston is one of the new frontiers along the waterfront,” he said. “that will see tremendous development over the next 20, 30 years. but, this is a statewide event and there should be some benefits that accrue to either lowell or lawrence or worcester or springfield. they’ve at least talked about the early rounds of some of these soccer matches and things like that being held in some of those areas, and there would obviously be upgrades necessary if that was going to happen.” asked about national security, on a scale of 1 to 10, lynch rated the threat of isis to america as “a 2 or a 3. if you look around the world, most of the attacks have been against law enforcement, military ... those types of attacks. i would think the proclivity of some of these individuals is to go after government, but i wouldn’t rule anything out. it’s a concern, don’t mistake me. we obviously have a need to tighten up our borders, no question about it. it’s not just from an immigration standpoint, it’s really a national security standpoint.”"}

prosecutors have argued that wallace, ortiz and hernandez went to pick up lloyd at his dorchester home in a nissan altima. lloyd was killed at around 3:30 a.m. at a north attleboro industrial park near hernandez’s home, according to prosecutors. both ortiz and wallace arrived at hernandez’s north attleboro home while the former university of florida star and his fiancee, shayanna jenkins, were out celebrating father’s day, according to fortier, who was babysitting the couple’s child that night. “i was startled. i looked over,” she said. “i noticed bo (wallace) at the window.” jurors watched as lead prosecutor william mccauley showed surveillance video of hernandez and jenkins leaving the property around 8 p.m. just after midnight, wallace and ortiz were shown pulling up in a small sedan, digging through the car, and then walking up to and knocking on the front door. fortier let them in, and “they said ‘hi’ to the baby” who was on the couch in hernandez’s living room, she said. in the surveillance video, hernandez is shown wearing a long-sleeved hooded shirt. prosecutors have said he was wearing that shirt when lloyd was murdered. fortier said wallace “appeared fine” and sober when they came in. in court papers, defense attorneys have argued that wallace and ortiz had taken pcp a day before the murder. hernandez’s attorneys want to bring in an expert to testify about the effects pcp have on the body. on several occasions, wallace is shown walking leaving and entering hernandez’s basement. prosecutors — through several of hernandez’s maids — have argued that wallace stayed in a guest room in the basement. one maid said she saw a “big gun” under wallace’s mattress. earlier this morning, diane fife biagiotti, a dna expert who last week said hernandez and lloyd both left dna on a “marijuana cigarette” found at the north attleboro crime scene, admitted that there was no way to tell when it was smoked. defense attorney james sultan asked if, through testing, it was possible to tell when, where or how the cigarette was shared by the men. “no,” she said. biagiotti also testified that hernandez’s dna was discovered on a shell casing that prosecutors say was discovered in the back of a rented nissan altima. an employee at the rental car facility testified earlier in the trial that she found the casing in the vehicle and threw it away in a nearby dumpster. authorities later found it covered in blue bubblegum.  "}

watched surveillance footage of odin lloyd getting into a car that prosecutors say escorted him to his death. the footage, shot by cameras set up by lloyd's neighbor, jose lopez, shows lloyd walking across the street before getting into a silver car at 2:33 a.m. on june 17, 2013. several versions of the same shot were shown to jurors, who sat affixed to the television screens in the jury box. prosecutors have said that hernandez and co-defendants ernest wallace and carlos ortiz picked up lloyd at his dorchester home in a rented nissan altima. authorities say they then drove to north attleboro and someone shot the former semi-pro footballer numerous times. the security cameras were set up on lopez's home, which is situated across the street from lloyd's residence. lopez said he “knew of” lloyd and had a “neighborly relationship.” he identified lloyd as the person in the video based “on the way he walked.” earlier in the day, prosecutors called jwan farhan, a cashier who was working at the blue hill express gas station convenience store on route 138 in canton, where hernandez allegedly stopped on his way to pick up lloyd. farhan said he was working an overnight shift on the day of lloyd's murder. farhan said that at around 2 a.m., hernandez got out of the driver's seat and pumped gas before the former patriot and “another individual” came into the store and bought gum and cigars. they paid with cash because the credit card system was down, and gave him less money than the items typically cost, farhan said. prosecutors have said that hernandez, wallace and ortiz stopped at the blue hill express gas station on the way to get lloyd. farhan was only able to identify hernandez. farhan also identified a receipt he made later, which indicated cotton-candy flavored bubble yum was purchased. prosecutors have shown jurors a piece of chewed-up bubble gum found in a nissan altima hernandez rented. authorities say hernandez used that car the night lloyd was murdered and its tire treads were found at the murder scene. prosecutors have said that hernandez blew through a weston toll on the massachusetts turnpike, without paying, the night lloyd was murdered. jurors were shown a photo from the weston toll, which showed the license plate of the rented nissan altima hernandez allegedly drove. the car went through the toll on june 17 at 2:53 a.m., according to official documents. rocky d'angelo, a manager at transcorv, a transportation company that subcontracts with ezpass, verified the footage. prosecutors have said that they have surveillance video of hernandez pulling into his driveway in the rented nissan altima around 3:30 a.m., just after lloyd was murdered in a north attleboro industrial park. earlier this morning, judge e. susan garsh held off testimony from dorothy stout, an expert who is expected to explain away certain discrepancies found in hernandez's surveillance footage. defense attorneys have said her testimony is unreliable, but prosecutors believe she has adequate expertise. garsh also received a note from a juror. hernandez, his defense team and prosecutors huddled with the judge in a secret sidebar session, though he juror was never called in for questioning and it's unclear what the note said. defense attorney james sultan sat and read the note with hernandez prior to the sidebar. so far, two jurors have been excused. one woman was booted after apparently trying to sneak onto the jury. another was excused for “personal reasons.” meanwhile, defense attorneys continued their campaign to discredit law enforcement officers who investigated lloyd's death. james sultan grilled paul baker, a state trooper with the bristol district attorney's office's homicide unit. he asked whether baker had tipped off the media about the hernandez investigation between june 17 and june 18 of that year. baker said “absolutely not” and maintained that he had no idea who told the media that the former patriot was the target of a homicide investigation. baker was involved with the initial search that turned up hernandez's surveillance system at his north attleboro home. he later alerted state trooper joseph collins that hernandez's attorney – robert jones – had the former tight end's cell phone and to go pick it up. yesterday, collins identified the phone, and it was admitted into evidence without objection. prosecutors have said the blackberry contains text messages between hernandez and lloyd that occurred within hours of the murder. collins said the phone was “broken down into three pieces” when jones gave it to him. earlier this week, jurors watched surveillance video of hernandez breaking down the cellphone inside a car while jones was waiting outside. baker later went into a dumpster and searched for evidence at a north attleboro enterprise rent-a-car facility. he found the shell casing, vitamin water bottle and blue bubble gum that prosecutors say link hernandez to the lloyd's murder. sultan prodded baker on his investigation techniques and asked whether he “sterilized” the back of his state-issued truck. that's where he and other troopers put garbage from the dumpster in order to find evidence. baker didn't remember how “we came to that decision.” “have you ever heard of evidence bags?” sultan asked. “yes,” baker responded. assistant district attorney william mccauley softened the blow and asked whether baker knew exactly what he was looking for. “yes, a child's drawing,” baker said, referring to the torn-up painting that the gum-covered shell casing was wrapped in. he added that he was wearing gloves throughout the search. when asked about the tactics used and who came up with the idea, baker said, “we're all trained investigators.\" \"it's not a dictatorship. ... we all bounce ideas off each other,\" he said. things got testy again when defense attorney michael fee cross-examined jean lorizio, an attorney at boston's licensing board. she said alcohol can't be served after 2 a.m., but fee pushed back and listed all of the things the board does not control. \"does massachusetts law or the board regulate private drinking in a hotel room?” he said, before listing other places where people can drink without breaking the law. prosecutors tried to eliminate all the places hernandez could have been drinking the night of lloyd's murder. assistant district attorney patrick bomberg struck back with a pointed question that caused a hush to envelop the room. \"do you know of any clubs at the north attleboro industrial park?” he asked. “no,” she said, before stepping down.          "}

(redacted) stated that the facility had reported the victim missing … with the norwood police department.” the 13-year-old returned home and “she wants him to stay home.” on april 4, 2013, police responded to a call at “617 morton street, apt. #2” where “officers spoke with (redacted) who was upset” with her son, 13, for smoking in the house. “(redacted) stated that she is having a hard time with her son in part (due) to the fact that she’s raising him herself.” the teen will be arraigned as a juvenile tomorrow on charges of involuntary manslaughter and unlawful possession of a firearm, according to the suffolk county district attorney’s office. the probe into where he got the gun continues. “there’s not much we can say at this stage but obviously it’s an important aspect of the investigation,” said district attorney daniel f. conley. “no child should have access to a loaded firearm — period. moreover, we all know kids that age. a 14-year-old boy can’t even keep a new phone a secret. it’s very likely he told someone about this weapon, including where he got it. we want the people with that information to come forward.” the walsh administration is girding up for a major battle to rid hub streets of illegal guns, including a gun buyback program, in the wake of the shooting. “we’re going to continue to work diligently to get more guns,” walsh said. “last year police took 678 off the street. we’re going to surpass that this year. think about that, the access to guns is far too easy.” in the hours following the shooting, hub cops arrested three men and seized their illegal guns in a ramped-up campaign to clean streets of illegal guns by targeting people suspected in “drug or gang-related activities,” police said yesterday. walsh, speaking at a community event at the devine rink in dorchester yesterday, said he plans to meet with the family of the boy who was killed and said friday was his most difficult day in his short tenure as mayor. “by far the hardest,” walsh said. “when a 9-year-old boy gets shot, loses his life, it’s awful.”  "}
