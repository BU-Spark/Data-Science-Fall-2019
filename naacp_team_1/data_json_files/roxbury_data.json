what percentage along are you?’ i think maybe the advocates at the time gave a much rosier projection than was the case. whether it rises to the level of misleading the federal government, i’m not sure. but if there was some wrongdoing here, it might give the federal government the opportunity to say, ‘well, those federal funds were obtained through fraud,’ and demand repayment,” lynch said. “look, there are laws out there. if it rises to the level of criminality, a felony, then those people will have to pay the price. what was worse in terms of what i read is that one of the contractors was actually fired because they would not green-light it and they were asking the right questions. that is more egregious than willing ignorance, i guess.” lynch called the recently shuffling of the top deck at boston 2024 “an improvement” and “fresh start” for the city’s bid to host the 2024 summer olympics — a move he said he told mayor martin j. walsh was overdue. “there’s a sporting component of the olympics,” lynch said, “but there’s also a construction part, there’s a security part, there’s a transportation part ... there’s also a finance part. so i thought that the approach that we might take — and i suggested this to the mayor — would be to bring in mitt romney, bring in mike dukakis. i mean, i know a lot of people don’t like him, but he is a stone-cold expert on transportation. bring in katherine craven, who’s done a wonderful job with housing for these universities. she’s been incredible. bring in people from all these disciplines. maybe an ed davis on security, and ask them to serve for a dollar. just for a dollar. do this for a dollar to serve this effort. i think it might bring people’s emotions a little less antagonistic to the olympics and might start a new day. “i don’t think necessarily that choosing larry bird and jo jo white and david ortiz was the comfort that people were looking for. we’re really looking at the fiscal aspect of this and the managerial aspect of this. and while they’re very popular — they’re wonderful people — i don’t think they’ll be providing that level of assurance that will adjust people’s fears.” asked if he considered it a setback for boston 2024 that no concrete spending plan has been made public, lynch said incoming chairman steve pagliuca, co-owner of the celtics, and philanthropist jack connors, who will serve as an advisor, “know the pressure’s on, and i’m sure they’ll try to address some of those questions as quickly as possible, but i haven’t had a chance to talk to either one of them and i’m not sure what the timeline is.” bringing pagliuca on board is “a step in the right direction. i’m not sure it’s enough,” he said. “i think people want to know if the cost overruns occur, who pays? what’s the process? it’s an insurable event, so is there some type of reinsurance that if this doesn’t happen or that doesn’t happen, we have a policy we can rely on. i don’t know how they structure it, but that’s why we have all these smart people in place.” lynch called a potential 60,000-seat olympic stadium in andrew square in south boston “the elephant in the room. i’m not in favor of that. they’re saying they’re going to build that 60,000-seat stadium and then take it down. i find that hard to believe. i think the neighborhoods of the south end, roxbury, dorchester and south boston are all concerned about that stadium because that’s a huge impact on that area. and it’s an area that’s coming up now. it’s really been transformed over the last 10 years. “i still am not convinced that that can work in that location. there was some other talk about suffolk downs because they’ve lost so much business there. the blue line is inadequate to service the needs of an olympic stadium in that area, but that would be a perfect opportunity to really rebuild and redo the blue line to service that entire community. “i think east boston is one of the new frontiers along the waterfront,” he said. “that will see tremendous development over the next 20, 30 years. but, this is a statewide event and there should be some benefits that accrue to either lowell or lawrence or worcester or springfield. they’ve at least talked about the early rounds of some of these soccer matches and things like that being held in some of those areas, and there would obviously be upgrades necessary if that was going to happen.” asked about national security, on a scale of 1 to 10, lynch rated the threat of isis to america as “a 2 or a 3. if you look around the world, most of the attacks have been against law enforcement, military ... those types of attacks. i would think the proclivity of some of these individuals is to go after government, but i wouldn’t rule anything out. it’s a concern, don’t mistake me. we obviously have a need to tighten up our borders, no question about it. it’s not just from an immigration standpoint, it’s really a national security standpoint.”"}
