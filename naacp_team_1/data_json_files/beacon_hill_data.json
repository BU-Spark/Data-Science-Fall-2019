baker refused to commit their support. usoc ceo scott blackmun said in a statement, \"when we made the decision to bid for the 2024 olympic games, one of the guiding principles that we adopted was that we would only submit a bid that we believed could win. \"notwithstanding the promise of the original vision for the bid, and the soundness of the plan developed under steve pagliuca, we have not been able to get a majority of the citizens of boston to support hosting the 2024 olympic and paralympic games. therefore, the usoc does not think that the level of support enjoyed by boston’s bid would allow it to prevail over great bids from paris, rome, hamburg, budapest or toronto .... we are out of time if the usoc is going to be able to consider a bid from another city. as a result, we have reached a mutual agreement to withdraw boston’s bid to host the 2024 olympic and paralympic games. baker declined to say if he was relieved or disappointed by the usoc's decision to drop boston's bid, but said he wasn't going to \"question\" the usoc or his decision to withhold his support for the bid until he saw an analysis of it. baker said he's still committed to having the brattle group -- the independent firm he and legislative leaders hired to analyze boston 2024's documents -- complete its report, which is expected next month, adding that he believes it can still be a \"useful document.\" \"there's a lot of strong feelings on this,\" he said of hosting the olympics. \"i've lived here my whole life. one of the things i like about living in massachusetts is we do have loud and robust policy and political debates on stuff like this.\" baker also pushed back at a suggestion that he was skeptical of hosting the olympics. \"i wouldn't call it skepticism. i would just say that, i never planned an olympics before. i wanted someone looking at this who had some experience with this kind of thing,\" he said, referencing the brattle group. \"you'd hate to end up two, three, four years down the road and figure out that there were some things you wish you knew in the beginning. ... that wasn't about skepticism. frankly, that was a recognition of the size and significance of the endeavor.\" baker said he never felt he was \"strong-armed or bullied at all\" by the usoc, though members had pressed him and walsh to commit to backing the bid. walsh said in a statement on the usoc decision: \"i strongly believe that bringing the olympic games back to the united states would be good for our country and would have brought long-term benefits to boston. however, no benefit is so great that it is worth handing over the financial future of our city and our citizens were rightly hesitant to be supportive as a result. we always anticipated having the time to do our due diligence on the guarantees required and a full review of the risk and mitigation package proposed last week. this is a monumental decision that cannot be rushed, even if it means not moving forward with our bid for the 2024 summer games.\" boston 2024 chariman steve pagliuca said in a statement: \"with more time to engage in a discussion about bid 2.0 – about its 8,000 new units of housing, tens of thousands of new jobs, and new tax revenues for the city – along with the appropriate review by mayor walsh, the brattle group, the governor and beacon hill leadership, we think public support would grow in boston and across the commonwealth. \"as we reflected on the timing and the status of our bid in this international competition, we have jointly come to the conclusion that the extensive efforts required in boston at this stage of the bid process would detract from the u.s.’ ability to compete against strong interest from cities like rome, paris, budapest and hamburg,\" pagliuca said. \"for this reason, we have jointly decided to withdraw boston’s bid in order to give the olympic movement in the united states the best chance to bring the games back to our country in 2024.\" \"this is a commitment that i cannot make without assurances that boston and its residents will be protected,\" walsh said at a hastily scheduled morning press conference at city hall. \"we have met every demand and every challenge, but i can not commit to putting the taxpayers at risk,\" walsh said. \"if committing to singing a guarantee today is what's required to move forward, then boston is no longer pursuing the 2024 olympic and paralympic games.\" \"we are unable to conclude our analysis without knowing the full scope of risk contained within the guarantee of the 2024 games,\" walsh said. \"i refuse to mortgage the future of the city away, i refuse to put boston on the hook for overruns, and i refuse to commit to signing a guarantee that uses taxpayers dollars to pay for the olympics.\" walsh said the city does not have to sign a document as the official u.s. bid city until september, and has until the ioc's september 2017 vote on which city will host the games to finalize a guarantee pact. the mayor, who has repeatedly vowed to protect city taxpayers from being on the hook for overruns connected to the bid, said he was reacting to reports and \"rumors\" about the united states olympic committee stepping up its pressure that the city agree to backstop costs for the games. he also cited a flood of opposition on twitter, which he attributed to \"about 10 people.\" walsh said the usoc pressure to commit doesn't give the city enough time to ensure proper protections for taxpayers, such as a liability cap. \"if we had another month, we possibly could, but the rumors i keep hearing by reading the papers of some of the usoc board members coming out in their statements, they concern me,\" walsh said, referencing recent calls from board members for gov. charlie baker and walsh to commit to backing the pursuit of the games. usoc officials asked baker for an update, to which repeated his intent to wait on the brattle group, according to the governor's office. a baker aide said there were three usoc officials on the call, in which the governor also praised boston 2024 chair steve pagliuca for producing a more detailed version of the bid committee's plans. the herald had reported that usoc members wanted to hear strong statements of support from baker and walsh. \"we need to know how (boston) is doing and if the people of the city are interested in hosting the games,\" anita l. defrantz, a member of the usoc and the international olympic committee, told the herald over the weekend. \"we need to get a report. i need to know.\" meanwhile, senate president stanley rosenberg lauded officials from their \"bold move\" in pursuing the olympics, but also said he never saw support from the federal government develop into what past host cities have enjoyed. \"i wondered in a state of 6.4 million people, what kind of power we needed behind us -- financial power and capacity behind us -- in order to make it real,\" rosenberg said. \"and if you look at so many of the other past games, the national government got behind it. they had the full country behind them. we saw no indication that our federal government was going to step up to the plate beyond just the security costs.\" speaker of the house robert a. deleo said he believes there are still \"valuable\" planning discussions to have that were started by the prospect of hosting the olympics. but he, too, said he has no regrets in waiting on the brattle group before weighing in on the olympic debate. \"i don't think our opinion has changed from day one in terms of how we felt this should be handled,\" deleo said. \"how are we going to do this? most importantly everyone involved with this process said no taxpayer money. that's what the purpose of really the brattle group was all about. ... i still consider it to be the right course of action to wait for that report.\""}

(r-north reading). “some of (the issues highlighted) are frustrating because they seem like common sense.” state rep. kay khan (d-newton), who is also a nurse, said she wants to “follow through” on how to better ensure children in the state’s care are getting needed medical screening. the audit noted that dcf could substantiate that only 40 percent of the 80-plus children in a sample had gotten man­dated screening within seven­ days, and fewer­ than half had an exam within 30 days of being in the state’s care. speaker of the house robert a. deleo (d-­winthrop) singled out the area as something the legis­lature may tackle. bump also said because dcf couldn’t give her office a complete list of foster placements for which the agency had granted waivers to those with criminal rec­ords, she had launched an additional “limited-scope audit” of dcf focusing on how the agency clears prospective foster parents with sketchy pasts. the herald has reported that the state granted 557 of the waivers in 2013 alone. commissioner olga roche continued to blame funding cuts for dcf failures in a prepared statement she read at a carefully orchestrated, 10-minute press conference. when re­porters objected to the limited time, roche announced, “i answered as many questions as you asked,” before leaving."}
