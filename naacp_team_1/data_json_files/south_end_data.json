his wife kristine were supporters of hannah and friends, the indiana-based nonprofit organization created by weis and his wife maura to provide housing and other opportunities for special needs children and adults. “so unbelievably sad today, there are no words,” maura ravenhurst weis said in an email to the herald. “our hearts go out to kris and her daughters. joe was a great friend to both

i think the board felt that they were updated,” he said, adding he hasn’t yet read the city-commissioned audit on the library. walsh’s chief of staff dan koh told boston herald radio this morning that he will be talking with ryan and board of trustees chair jeffrey rudman on a “daily basis” until “we figure all this out.” when asked if he expected the library’s board of trustees would meet before their next scheduled meeting in september, koh said: “i absolutely do.” a city audit dated may 1 warned of the potential for “internal theft” from the library’s special collections. “the significant value of some items makes increased security a high priority, particularly as it relates to protection against internal theft,” a copy of the audit reviewed by the herald states. among the “long-term” recommendations made by the audit is “design and implement a security system which protects against potential employee theft.” the audit also blasted the management of the special collections, where the rare works were kept. “while circulating collections are well‐managed, research and special collections are not,” the audit states. “it is critical that the bpl have an inventory report that should list each item it owns, the item’s acquisition date, its cost and/or estimated value, its condition, where it is housed, and if there are any special security concerns or standards required for its viewing. this consolidated inventory list does not exist. current estimates for holdings are (in most categories) guesses made many years ago that have been adjusted with newer guesses along the way. storage is haphazard and not environmentally controlled ... and, while security staff has taken steps to better control key access to high value areas, they agree that they are exposed to internal theft. ... every aspect of managing special collections will need further review to ensure proper stewardship of these unique (and in some cases highly valuable) items. the audit recommends the library “complete full inventory of owned assets, deaccession non‐core special collections, pause purchasing in rare books and prints, refocus special collections away from acquisition and towards discoverability.” the audit was first reported today by the boston globe. walsh said his office received the audit “a couple days ago” but that he hasn’t had a chance to fully review it. “certainly some of the findings clearly prove that there are some problems with security and some other issues at the library,” he said. “we have to go in and check it out and have a conversation with the board of trustees and see how they are going to make adjustments to fix it.” the mayor said during his meeting with ryan yesterday, the audit was addressed. “we have to make some adjustments and i’m going to demand that the board of trustees and the president of the library make the changes necessary so that we avoid these problems,” he said. “we should not have these problems at the library.” the library, the audit reveals, receives nearly 80 percent of its funding from the city of boston. the remainder comes from the state, gifts and other sources."}

what percentage along are you?’ i think maybe the advocates at the time gave a much rosier projection than was the case. whether it rises to the level of misleading the federal government, i’m not sure. but if there was some wrongdoing here, it might give the federal government the opportunity to say, ‘well, those federal funds were obtained through fraud,’ and demand repayment,” lynch said. “look, there are laws out there. if it rises to the level of criminality, a felony, then those people will have to pay the price. what was worse in terms of what i read is that one of the contractors was actually fired because they would not green-light it and they were asking the right questions. that is more egregious than willing ignorance, i guess.” lynch called the recently shuffling of the top deck at boston 2024 “an improvement” and “fresh start” for the city’s bid to host the 2024 summer olympics — a move he said he told mayor martin j. walsh was overdue. “there’s a sporting component of the olympics,” lynch said, “but there’s also a construction part, there’s a security part, there’s a transportation part ... there’s also a finance part. so i thought that the approach that we might take — and i suggested this to the mayor — would be to bring in mitt romney, bring in mike dukakis. i mean, i know a lot of people don’t like him, but he is a stone-cold expert on transportation. bring in katherine craven, who’s done a wonderful job with housing for these universities. she’s been incredible. bring in people from all these disciplines. maybe an ed davis on security, and ask them to serve for a dollar. just for a dollar. do this for a dollar to serve this effort. i think it might bring people’s emotions a little less antagonistic to the olympics and might start a new day. “i don’t think necessarily that choosing larry bird and jo jo white and david ortiz was the comfort that people were looking for. we’re really looking at the fiscal aspect of this and the managerial aspect of this. and while they’re very popular — they’re wonderful people — i don’t think they’ll be providing that level of assurance that will adjust people’s fears.” asked if he considered it a setback for boston 2024 that no concrete spending plan has been made public, lynch said incoming chairman steve pagliuca, co-owner of the celtics, and philanthropist jack connors, who will serve as an advisor, “know the pressure’s on, and i’m sure they’ll try to address some of those questions as quickly as possible, but i haven’t had a chance to talk to either one of them and i’m not sure what the timeline is.” bringing pagliuca on board is “a step in the right direction. i’m not sure it’s enough,” he said. “i think people want to know if the cost overruns occur, who pays? what’s the process? it’s an insurable event, so is there some type of reinsurance that if this doesn’t happen or that doesn’t happen, we have a policy we can rely on. i don’t know how they structure it, but that’s why we have all these smart people in place.” lynch called a potential 60,000-seat olympic stadium in andrew square in south boston “the elephant in the room. i’m not in favor of that. they’re saying they’re going to build that 60,000-seat stadium and then take it down. i find that hard to believe. i think the neighborhoods of the south end, roxbury, dorchester and south boston are all concerned about that stadium because that’s a huge impact on that area. and it’s an area that’s coming up now. it’s really been transformed over the last 10 years. “i still am not convinced that that can work in that location. there was some other talk about suffolk downs because they’ve lost so much business there. the blue line is inadequate to service the needs of an olympic stadium in that area, but that would be a perfect opportunity to really rebuild and redo the blue line to service that entire community. “i think east boston is one of the new frontiers along the waterfront,” he said. “that will see tremendous development over the next 20, 30 years. but, this is a statewide event and there should be some benefits that accrue to either lowell or lawrence or worcester or springfield. they’ve at least talked about the early rounds of some of these soccer matches and things like that being held in some of those areas, and there would obviously be upgrades necessary if that was going to happen.” asked about national security, on a scale of 1 to 10, lynch rated the threat of isis to america as “a 2 or a 3. if you look around the world, most of the attacks have been against law enforcement, military ... those types of attacks. i would think the proclivity of some of these individuals is to go after government, but i wouldn’t rule anything out. it’s a concern, don’t mistake me. we obviously have a need to tighten up our borders, no question about it. it’s not just from an immigration standpoint, it’s really a national security standpoint.”"}

with 239 people on board for more than 24 hours, while malaysian aviation authorities investigated how two passengers were apparently able to get on the aircraft using stolen passports. there was still no confirmed sighting of wreckage from the boeing 777 in the seas between malaysia and vietnam where it vanished from screens early saturday morning en route to beijing from kuala lumpur. the weather was fine, the plane was already cruising and the pilots had no time to send a distress signal — unusual circumstance for a modern jetliner to crash. li jiaxiang, administrator of the civil aviation administration of china, said some debris had been spotted, but it was unclear whether it came from the plane. vietnamese authorities said they had seen nothing close to two large oil slicks they saw saturday and said might be from the missing plane. malaysia's civil aviation chief azaharuddin abdul rahman said his country had expanded its area of operation to the west coast of peninsular malaysia, on the other side of the country from where the plane disappeared. \"this is standard procedure. if we can't find it here, we go to other places,\" he said. finding traces of an aircraft that disappears over sea can take days or longer, even with a sustained search effort. depending on the circumstances of the crash, wreckage can be scattered over many square kilometers (miles). if the plane enters the water before breaking up, there can be relatively little debris. investigators will need access to the flight data recorders to determine what happened. terrorism is always considered a possibility, but the sudden disappearance of flight mh370 has given extra emphasis to speculation a bomb might have been on board. other scenarios include some catastrophic failure of the engines or structure of the plane, extreme turbulence or even pilot suicide. on saturday, foreign ministries in italy and austria said the names of two citizens listed on the flight's manifest matched the names on two passports reported stolen in thailand. it's unclear how common it is for people to get on flights with fake passports, but the news added to fears of terrorism. azaharuddin said sunday that authorities were \"aware of the situation and we are doing an investigation at the moment.\" malaysia airlines has a good safety record, as does the 777, which had not had a fatal crash in its 19-year history until an asiana airlines plane crashed last july in san francisco, killing three passengers, all teenagers from china. prof. jason middleton, the head of the sydney-based university of new south wales' school of aviation, said terrorism or some other form of foul play seemed a likely explanation. \"you're looking at some highly unexpected thing, and the only ones people can think of are basically foul play, being either a bomb or some immediate incapacitating of the pilots by someone doing the wrong thing and that might lead to an airplane going straight into the ocean,\" middleton said on sunday. \"with two stolen passports (on board), you'd have to suspect that that's one of the likely options.\" just 9 percent of fatal accidents happen when a plane is at cruising altitude, according to a statistical summary of commercial jet accidents done by boeing. malaysia airlines ceo ahmad jauhari yahya said saturday there was no indication the pilots had sent a distress signal. the plane was last inspected 10 days ago and found to be \"in proper condition,\" ignatius ong, ceo of malaysia airlines subsidiary firefly airlines, said at a news conference. two-thirds of the jet's passengers were from china. the rest were from elsewhere in asia, north america and europe. asked whether terrorism was suspected, malaysian prime minister najib razak said authorities were \"looking at all possibilities, but it is too early to make any conclusive remarks.\" greg barton, a professor of international politics at australia's monash university and a terrorism expert, said if the disaster was the result of terrorism, there is no obvious suspect. if it was terrorism, barton expected china would be quick to blame separatists from the ethnic uighur minority, as authorities did recently when 29 people were killed in knife attacks at a train station in the southern city of kunming. \"if a group like that is behind it, then suddenly they've got a capacity that we didn't know they had before, they've executed  it very well — that's very scary,\" barton told ap. \"it's safe to start with the assumption that that's not very likely, but possible.\" ___ brummitt reported from hanoi, vietnam. ___ associated press journalist rod mcguirk in canberra; didi tang and aritz parra in beijing; stephen wright in bangkok; colleen barry in milan;

citywide hangover, from more mischief and mayhem on hub streets to higher taxpayer costs to police them.\n\n“my mother always used to say, ‘nothing good happens after 11 p.m.,’ ” said jeffrey gates of the aquitaine group, which includes gaslight brasserie and union in the south end.  kuala lumpur, malaysia  — vietnamese air force planes on saturday spotted two large oil slicks close to where a malaysia airlines boeing 777 went missing earlier in the day, the first sign that the aircraft carrying 239 people had crashed. the air force planes were part of a multinational search operation launched after flight mh370 fell off radar screens less than an hour after it took off from kuala lumpur for beijing early saturday morning. the oil slicks were spotted late saturday off the southern tip of vietnam and were each between 10 kilometers (6 miles) and 15 kilometers (9 miles) long, the vietnamese government said in a statement. there was no confirmation that the slicks were related to the missing plane, but the statement said they were consistent with the kinds that would be produced by the two fuel tanks of a crashed jetliner. two-thirds of the missing plane's passengers were from china, while others were from elsewhere in asia, north america and europe. malaysia airlines ceo ahmad jauhari yahya said there was no indication that the pilots had sent a distress signal, suggesting that whatever happened to the plane occurred quickly and possibly catastrophically. asked whether terrorism was suspected, malaysian prime minister najib razak said, \"we are looking at all possibilities, but it is too early to make any conclusive remarks.\" foreign ministry officials in italy and austria said the names of two nationals from those countries listed on the flight's manifest matched passports reported stolen in thailand. italy's foreign ministry said the italian man who was listed as being a passenger, luigi maraldi, was traveling in thailand and was not aboard the plane. it said he reported his passport stolen last august. austria's foreign ministry confirmed that a name listed on the manifest matched an austrian passport reported stolen two years ago in thailand. it said the austrian was not on the plane, but would not confirm the person's identity. at beijing's airport, authorities posted a notice asking relatives and friends of passengers to gather at a nearby hotel to wait for further information, and provided a shuttle bus service. a woman wept aboard the bus while saying on a mobile phone, \"they want us to go to the hotel. it cannot be good.\" relatives and friends of passengers were escorted into a private area at the hotel, but reporters were kept away. a man in a gray hooded sweatshirt later stormed out complaining about a lack of information. the man, who said he was a beijing resident but declined to give his name, said he was anxious because his mother was on board the flight with a group of 10 tourists. \"we have been waiting for hours and there is still no verification,\" he said. the plane was last detected on radar at 1:30 a.m. (1730 gmt friday) around where the south china sea meets the gulf of thailand, authorities in malaysia and vietnam said. lai xuan thanh, director of vietnam's civil aviation authority, said air traffic officials in the country never made contact with the plane. the plane \"lost all contact and radar signal one minute before it entered vietnam's air traffic control,\" lt. gen. vo van tuan, deputy chief of staff of the vietnamese army, said in a statement. the south china sea is a tense region with competing territorial claims that have led to several low-level conflicts, particularly between china and the philippines. that antipathy briefly faded saturday as china, the philippines, vietnam, singapore and malaysia all sent ships and planes to the region. najib said malaysia had dispatched 15 planes and nine ships to the area. the u.s. navy was sending a warship and a surveillance plane, while singapore said it would send a submarine and a plane. china and vietnam also were sending aircraft to help in the search. it's not uncommon for it to take several days to find the wreckage of aircraft floating on the ocean. locating and then recovering the flight data recorders, vital to any investigation, can take months or even years. \"in times of emergencies like this, we have to show unity of efforts that transcends boundaries and issues,\" said lt. gen. roy deveraturda, commander of the philippine military's western command. after the oil slick was spotted, the air search was suspended for the night and was to resume sunday morning, while the sea search was ongoing, malaysia airlines said. the plane was carrying 227 passengers, including two infants, and 12 crew members, the airline said. it said there were 152 passengers from china, 38 from malaysia, seven from indonesia, six from australia, five from india, three from the u.s., and others from indonesia, france, new zealand, canada, ukraine, russia, taiwan and the netherlands. in kuala lumpur, family members gathered at the airport, but were kept away from reporters. \"our team is currently calling the next of kin of passengers and crew. focus of the airline is to work with the emergency responders and authorities and mobilize its full support,\" said ahmad jauhari, the airline ceo. \"our thoughts and prayers are with all affected passengers and crew and their family members.\" fuad sharuji, malaysia airlines' vice president of operations control, told cnn that the plane was flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet (10,670 meters) when it disappeared and that the pilots had reported no problem with the aircraft. malaysia airlines has a good safety record, as does the 777, which had not had a fatal crash in its 19-year history until an asiana airlines plane crashed in san francisco in july 2013, killing three passengers, all teenagers from china. airliner \"black boxes\" — the flight data and cockpit voice recorders — are equipped with \"pingers\" that emit ultrasonic signals that can be detected underwater. under good conditions, the signals can be detected from several hundred miles away, said john goglia, a former member of the u.s. national transportation safety board. if the boxes are trapped inside the wreckage, the sound may not travel as far, he said. if the boxes are at the bottom of an underwater trench, that also hinders how far the sound can travel. the signals also weaken over time. air france flight 447, with 228 people on board, disappeared over the atlantic ocean en route from rio de janeiro to paris on june 1, 2009. some wreckage and bodies were recovered over the next two weeks, but it took nearly two years for the main wreckage of the airbus 330 and its black boxes to be located and recovered. malaysia airlines said the 53-year-old pilot of flight mh370, zaharie ahmad shah, has more than 18,000 flying hours and has been flying for the airline since 1981. the first officer, 27-year-old fariq hamid, has about 2,800 hours of experience and has flown for the airline since 2007. the tip of the wing of the same malaysian airlines boeing 777-200 broke off aug. 9, 2012, as it was taxiing at pudong international airport outside shanghai. the wingtip collided with the tail of a china eastern airlines a340 plane. no one was injured. malaysia airlines' last fatal incident was in 1995, when one its planes crashed near the malaysian city of tawau, killing 34 people. the deadliest crash in its history occurred in 1977, when a domestic malaysian flight crashed after being hijacked, killing 100 people. in august 2005, a malaysian airlines 777 flying from perth, australia, to kuala lumpur suddenly shot up 900 meters (3,000 feet) before the pilot disengaged the autopilot and landed safely. the plane's software had incorrectly measured speed and acceleration, and the software was quickly updated on planes around the world. malaysia airlines has 15 boeing 777-200s in its fleet of about 100 planes. the state-owned carrier last month reported its fourth straight quarterly loss and warned of tougher times.

(from $1,520 to $2,166 monthly for a family of five.) the navigator explained that our co-pays are also jumping — from $20 to $30 per office visit — and we also could be subject to an additional $4,000 of out-of-pocket expenses for a variety of medical services not covered under obamacare, such as x-rays, cat scans and more. total it up, and obama­care could cost my family an extra $12,000 annually! what happened to the president’s promise that the average family would save $2,500 per year? it’s no wonder the washington post gave the president four pinocchios in 2013. and politifact, a fact-checking website, said obama told the “lie of the year.” the president misled us when he said the affordable care act wouldn’t affect those who already had insurance. ditto when he promised you wouldn’t lose your doctor. how many other democrats in office parroted those same lies to their constituents? nancy pelosi was wrong when she said the aca was a “jobs bill.” not true. the aca has done the opposite. the congressional budget office, a nonpartisan group, has reported the aca will kill at least 2.5 million full-time jobs and add at least $1 trillion to our national debt. plus cause a mass doctor shortage. you don’t need more evidence to know america has been sold a false bill of goods. adding insult to injury, harry reid recently said the obamacare “horror stories” being told are all “untrue.” sorry, harry. my family is a victim of obama­care. bottom line: we can’t have a strong nation when citizens can’t trust their own government. thankfully, we have the 2014 and 2016 elections to affect change. it’s time to vote all the pinocchios out. adriana cohen is co-host of “trending now” on boston herald radio. visit adrianacohen.com or follow her on twitter @adrianacohen16. if you’ve been hurt by the aca, send an email to newstips@bostonherald.com or call 617-619-6493."}
