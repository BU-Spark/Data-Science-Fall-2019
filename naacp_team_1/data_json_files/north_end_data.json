michael leviton with a4 pizza, serving gorgeous pie with world-class brew; tony maws with kirkland tap \u0026 trotter, offering affordable plates with the chef’s famed attention to detail; and ana sortun’s new turkish-inspired sarma. the ever-changing back bay and south end welcomed an eclectic array of newcomers such as estelle’s southern cuisine (a late 2012 addition), boston chops, the sumptuous “urban steak bistro” from chef chris coombs; and jason santos’ clubby newcomer, back bay harry’s. we witnessed in 2013 a renewed appreciation for chef-driven americana and new england culinary heritage, led by the likes of chris parsons at gorgeous steel \u0026 rye in milton, will gilson’s puritan \u0026 co. in cambridge (both late 2012 entries that wowed diners in 2013) and the brand-new commonwealth from steve “nookie” postal, also in cambridge. the gentrification of working-class enclaves such as south boston and quincy continued at a rapid pace. spacious lincoln tavern came to define the “new southie” in 2013, filled with beautiful young professionals while offering perhaps the best wood-fired pizza in boston. stephi’s in southie brought a touch of newbury street to once-gritty broadway station. the city of quincy filed for 27 new liquor licenses in 2013, in anticipation of an influx of new eateries with the billion-dollar reconstruction of its historic downtown. assembly brought a trendy \u2028gastropub vibe to quincy in late 2012, while sparkling brand-new asian eateries such as china sports bar \u0026 restaurant and yocha frozen yogurt \u0026 tea reshape its up-and-coming dining scene. local chefs worked the literary circuit, too, with new books from joanne chang of flour bakery fame (“flour, too”); daniel bruce of the boston harbor hotel \u2028(“daniel bruce simply new england”); the world-champion barbecue tandem of chris hart and andy husbands (“wicked good burgers”); and difillippo’s restaurant-industry primer \u2028(“it’s all about the guest”). and of course, bostonians in 2013 bid goodbye to old favorites, such as the north shore landmark hilltop steak house, cambridge’s famed chez henri, which closed last month, and upstairs on the square, which serves its final meal at its new year’s eve party tomorrow night. row 34 beer-steamed littlenecks hef jeremy sewall) 2 t. canola oil 1 t. garlic, minced 1 t. shallots, minced 32 cleaned littleneck clams 1  c. india pale ale or lager  c. scallion greens, sliced 2 t. butter salt and pepper to taste 1 t. fresh lemon juice in a large pan, heat canola oil and sweat shallots and garlic until they begin to color lightly. add clams and beer. cover and steam until the clams begin to open. move clams to a large serving bowl, leaving liquid simmering in pan. add scallions and butter to the liquid and stir until butter melts. remove from heat and season with salt, pepper and lemon juice. pour sauce over clams and serve with warm toasted bread. serves 4.   strega prime’s rosemary and mustard-crusted lamb lollipops hef farouk bazoune) 1 baby rack of lamb,\u2028 frenched 1 t. fresh rosemary,\u2028 minced 2 t. dijon mustard 1 garlic glove, minced 2 t. salt 1 t. black pepper 4 t. olive oil mix rosemary, mustard, garlic, salt, pepper and 2 tablespoons olive oil together in a small bowl. coat lamb rack with mixture, massaging into meat. refrigerate 1 hour. preheat oven to 350 degrees. heat remaining olive oil in a nonstick pan. sear rack of lamb about 2 minute per side, then bake about 6 minutes. remove from oven and let sit about 3 minutes. carefully slice rack using bones as guide. you should get eight lollipops per rack. serves 2 to 4.   ward 8’s hot apple toddy ar manager mike wyatt) 8 oz. down east cider  oz. calvados (french apple\u2028 brandy)  oz. orange juice  oz. cinnamon syrup heat 1 serving of down east cider, steaming hot, not boiling, while building the remaining ingredients in a glass mug. top with hot cider, garnish with a cinnamon stick.   carrie nation’s old fashioned ar manager brian mantz) 2 oz. bulleit rye 2 dashes angostura bitters splash of demerara simple syrup (equal parts water, turbinado sugar) combine all ingredients in a mixing glass. stir and serve in a rocks or old fashioned glass over ice. garnish with an orange slice and maraschino cherries. makes 1 cocktail.   “wicked good burgers” pig candy 1 c. packed light brown sugar  t. cayenne pepper 1 lb. slab bacon, thick cut  c. maple syrup preheat oven to 375 degrees. mix brown sugar and cayenne in a small bowl. line a half-sheet pan with aluminum foil and set a cooling rack on it. lay sliced bacon on the rack. using fingers, rub a thick layer of brown sugar-cayenne mixture into the tops of the bacon slices. bake for 10 minutes. remove from oven and brush each slice with maple syrup. wearing disposable gloves (bacon will be very hot and sticky), turn the bacon over and sprinkle remaining sugar-cayenne mixture on other side. bake 10 to 20 minutes or until crispy. remove and brush bacon with remaining maple syrup. cool and serve as topping on favorite burgers or for nibbling."}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dd72c6617f83a14e1503b8a"},"timestamp":1.39689741e+09,"story":"mayor martin j. walsh told a gathering of north end businessmen this morning his big dreams for the city include hosting the ncaa final four, but not sweeping under the rug the sections of boston that are downright “filthy.” the city’s street sweepers officially emerged from hibernation today, but as part of his two-week “boston shines” campaign kicking off later this month in west roxbury, jamaica plain, roxbury, allston and brighton, walsh is asking every man, woman and business owner to grab a broom and a dust pan, roll up their sleeves and pitch in. “i do think people should sweep in front of their house and i do think businesses should sweep in front of their business. it shouldn’t be the sole responsibility of the city to clean the streets. people should take pride in their neighborhoods. people should take pride in their businesses and help us in keeping the streets clean, and don’t be throwing litter out windows and throwing it in the gutters,” walsh said after telling a north end chamber of commerce breakfast at the fairmount battery wharf hotel “some parts of boston (are) filthy.” “you know, everyone lives there, including the person causing the litter,” walsh said later. asked by the herald how he will respond to any resistance, “what are my taxes for?” walsh said. “go out and sweep in front of your gutter. it’s not that hard. i do it. other people do it. taxes aren’t just there for street cleaning. taxes are there for public safety. taxes are there for educating kids. taxes are there to make sure the water and sewer is running properly. taxes are there to make sure all city services keep moving forward. “i don’t know it’s solely the responsibility of city government to clean the streets,” he said, “so i’d ask people to take some pride and clean in front of their house.” walsh told chamber members he’s also open to spreading citywide same-day trash and recycling services already working out in the south end. “i’m not afraid to change,” he said. citywide beautification is key to walsh’s assurance to little italy’s entrepreneurs his freshman administration is keenly focused on tourism, which he said trails only medical care and education as boston’s biggest industry. in addition to a late-night task force walsh said is already exploring “creating a culture around nightlife,” 24-hour gyms and persuading younger generations not to leave boston when they marry and start families, the mayor is forming an arts and culture cabinet and an office of sports, entertainment and special events. the latter will be tasked with attracting to boston major events like the final four, professional sports all-star games and u.s. figure skating championships. “i’ll be standing with you more often than not,” walsh said. “i don’t want to do anything that’s going to hurt your businesses. i want to do things that will give those businesses the opportunity to thrive and survive. we’re focusing a lot on hospitality and tourism and you’re at the heart of it. nothing compares to the north end.”  "}
