while her abductor raped her repeatedly and threatened to kill her, while telling her they were going to start a family together and posing her in photos to make it appear they were on vacation. as victor pena pleaded not guilty to new charges today, assistant suffolk district attorney ian polumbaum gave a disturbing account of what the woman experienced after she was taken by force from congress street after a night of carousing jan. 19. “what she remembered next was waking up on a bare mattress in a filthy apartment with a total stranger next to her, mr. pena, who, when she tried to gather her things to leave, stopped her, told her to be quiet or he’d kill her. then said — what was to become a theme of his statements over the next couple of days — that he had rescued her, that he was glad he’d found her, that they were going to start a family together and that he hadn’t seen his own daughter in 10 years,” polumbaum said. pena “took images of her with his cellphone both by herself and in selfies with him. he put sunglasses on as if they were at the beach together and told her to pose and kiss him and smile,” polumbaum told the court. “she complied with that a few times, but taken as a whole these are not happy pictures.” polumbaum added, “she described thinking about ways to escape, maybe hitting him with an object or stabbing him with a utensil, but she was afraid she had one try and if it failed things would get worse.” pena, 38, of charlestown pleaded not guilty through a spanish interpreter in suffolk superior court today to one indictment charging him with kidnapping and 10 others charging him with aggravated rape in connection with the accuser’s nearly four-day confinement in a charlestown public housing in january. he shook his head and made the sign of the cross. assistant clerk-magistrate lisa b. medeiros ordered pena to continue to be held without bail pending an april 10 dangerousness hearing. the pena case was the first of two disturbing abductions of intoxicated women in boston’s bar scene this year. last month, jassy correia was found dead in delaware after being abducted. louis d. coleman iii has been charged in federal court with kidnapping resulting in death. in the pena abduction case, polumbaum said the woman had gone to hennessy’s bar on union street the night of jan. 19. “she became very intoxicated,” polumbaum explained. “she and another man she was dancing with got escorted out of the bar. that other man’s friends pulled him away. that left the young woman walking alone on the street in the snow. she has no memory of what came next.” polumbaum said it was while she was crossing congress street that pena approached her and a second man tried to warn him, ” ‘leave her alone, she’s drunk.’ mr. pena ignored that and started hugging and kissing and walking with the young woman, basically ignoring the other guy, who eventually left.” he said it’s “obvious” from surveillance footage that captured pena and the accuser that “she’s out of it and unable to walk on her own. at one point, he carried her for a short distance.” a witness, he said, later saw pena propping the accuser up on a seat on the orange line as her eyes fluttered. polumbaum said the woman was raped repeatedly beginning “while she was incapacitated” and again over the next two and half days before boston police traced pena to his apartment and rescued her. polumbaum said the only food the accuser was provided was canned pineapple and that on the third day of her kidnapping she was force-fed vodka and whiskey. “he told her to read the bible out loud in spanish,” he said. “she knew spanish so that’s mostly how they communicated.” police closed in on pena jan. 22 after an app indicated her cellphone was in charlestown. surveillance video helped them trace the path of the abduction and identify the suspect. police found pena had installed an unauthorized deadbolt lock on his public housing apartment door and called workers to drill it open. “as the drilling started, mr. pena told the victim to get dressed, he gave her back her phone — he turned it on,” polumbaum said. while pena was being interviewed on camera by police, and at his initial court appearance in charlestown the following day, polumbaum said, “he played up symptoms of possible incompetency, which the people who evaluated him did not feel were genuine.” jose pena told reporters today his brother is mentally disabled and claimed that the accuser is making up her story because she’s embarrassed she went home with him. “nobody could get kidnapped while walking two miles and not asking for help. you can always ask for help, even when you’re wasted,” jose pena angrily insisted outside the courtroom. “you reach out with your eyes, your body … this girl, she’s just trying to save her reputation.” he said the reason his brother put a deadbolt lock on his door is because he’s a hoarder and was afraid his condition would get him evicted.  "}

(boston), and founder of top shelf entertainment. he is well-known to many in the hospitality industry as their first call when in legal trouble.”"}
