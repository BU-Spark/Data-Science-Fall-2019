woman was seriously injured when a broken bat flew into the stands two days earlier. he never considered surrendering those front-row seats that aren't guarded by netting. but he would be sure to protect little christopher. \"i'll definitely be watching out for him and putting him on my lap,\" barnard said before sunday's game between the athletics and red sox. it's a delicate balance for fans throughout the major leagues: weighing the danger of being hit by a wayward bat or ball against the enhanced experience of being so close to the action, few closer than at cozy fenway. over the past three days, bats have flown into the stands in at least three cities. yet fans consider the risk of injury minimal. \"i'd absolutely sit down here. why not?\" said 38-year-old doug jones, who was in the front row along the third-base line in boston on sunday, \"but you need to pay attention.\" on friday night, 44-year-old tonya carpenter was struck in the head by a bat that broke on a swing by oakland's brett lawrie in the second inning of boston's 4-2 win. she was treated in the stands then rushed to beth israel deaconess medical center with what police described as life-threatening injuries. her condition has been upgraded from serious to fair condition, her family said monday in a statement released by the hospital. \"the well-being of tonya and her loved ones are forefront in our minds,\" the red sox said monday. \"major league baseball will re-examine fan safety at ballparks, and we will fully participate in that process.\" in cincinnati, no one was hurt saturday when a bat landed in the stands. everyone was ok sunday when a bat sailed into the seats at the tigers-white sox game in chicago. and in the first inning of the red sox 7-4 win over the athletics on sunday, boston's hanley ramirez lost control of his bat. it hit the net in front of oakland's dugout. in the wake of carpenter's injury, new commissioner rob manfred said monday that major league baseball will re-evaluate fan safety at stadiums. \"when you have an issue like this, an incident like this, you have to go back and re-evaluate where you are on all of your safety issues and trust me, we will do that. just like we are on a variety of issues right now at the beginning of my tenure,\" manfred said at the amateur draft in secaucus, new jersey. some fans with seats near the field prefer to sit directly behind home plate where they're protected by a net. parents sometimes arrange seating with their children between them. others said they don't consider safety when buying tickets. at most major league parks, the netting that protects fans from foul balls covers the backstop behind the catcher, but stops before each dugout. some fans said they would sit closer to the field if the netting were extended. but that net might decrease a fan's enjoyment of the sights and sounds — the lush green grass, the smack of the ball into the catcher's glove — on a perfect afternoon for baseball like sunday, sunny and warm with a slight breeze at historic fenway. \"i do understand the objection of having something in front of you,\" said 42-year-old chad leblanc, who attended sunday's game with his 12-year-old son logan. another fan, jeremy welford, said he was more conscious of the risk after friday's injury. \"if you're with a youngster, it's too dangerous,\" he said with his 9-year-old daughter megan beside him. \"i sit behind the nets all the time and it doesn't bother me.\" manfred was asked if mlb will consider requiring clubs to extend the protective netting beyond the area directly behind home plate. \"there's a variety of issues that we're going to take a fresh look at,\" he said. \"you have to react strongly to an incident like this, but i think the best word for it is that we're going to re-evaluate where we are on the topic.\" the backs of tickets tell fans to remain alert. at fenway, about a dozen signs facing fans in the front row of box seats warn red and white capital letters: \"be alert foul balls and bats hurt.\" also facing them along that low wall are about twice as many televisions they can watch while a batter is swinging. at miami's game at colorado on sunday, mike and erin hart, both adult league softball players, sat just above the third-base dugout, one of the best spots at coors field to catch foul balls. their two children were with them. \"we figured we'd put them in the middle, because then we could protect them a little bit better,\" erin said. \"we brought our gloves. i figured if we're not fast enough, we can dive on top of them if need be.\" no matter how vigilant, fans do turn away from the action to snap a selfie, fill in a scorecard or hail a hot dog vendor. at kansas city's game against texas, royals fan candace hickman said, \"i wish the royals would expand the netting to at least the end of the dugouts to protect the fans better from foul balls. even if you are watching closely, those line drives can reach the seats in a split second.\" in chicago, ray finfer sat with his three sons when adam laroche's bat went into the stands sunday. \"i saw the bat coming and my thought is hopefully you're watching the game.\" he said. \"if you're not going to do that, it's not a great seat for you.\" in toronto, karen luscombe, sat behind the third-base dugout with her son. \"i worry about it, for sure,\" she said, but \"the best view is where we want to sit.\" in cincinnati, laura steinmetz hawke usually sits in the upper deck for the price and the view, not for safety reasons. \"there is inherent risk in living life, and we cannot make every experience 100 percent safe,\" she said. and at fenway, francesca cirillo sat with her husband and 18-month-old daughter aria about 10 rows behind the spot where the fan was injured friday night. \"i feel horrible for her,\" she said but called what happened \"a freak accident\" and wasn't uncomfortable sitting so close to the field. \"we brought our daughter,\" she said. \"we had the opportunity to leave her at home, but we decided to bring her because this is the first time i'm able to bring her to fenway.\" ___ ap sports writer

(charlie) baker and the executive office of public safety to come up with a real number in terms of what they need ... to hire enough elevator inspectors to get to a more reasonable level,” kocot said. “this is not a new problem. but i’m sure he realizes this is something to work on.” kocot, who co-chairs the committee on state administration and regulatory oversight, has filed a bill that would push the department of public safety to disclose not just its inspection backlog, but the amount of time each pending inspection has been on the waiting list and a plan to reduce it to three or fewer days. he said it was spurred by stories in his own western massachusetts district, where a faulty elevator was left out of order for days at a southampton elderly living­ complex last june before kocot called the governor’s office to press an inspector into action. “literally, many of them could not get up to their rooms,” kocot said. he also described how the city of northampton last summer fought a $20,000 fine from the state because its inspection had lapsed at an elevator at a public school. lawmakers have tried to address the shortage of elevator inspectors; this year’s budget allowed the public safety department to hire more inspectors. but state officials said they only had 55 as of this week — one more than a year ago when a woman fell down a fenway park elevator shaft — with plans to hire seven more in the works."}

what did i do to get myself in that position?’ i know the outcome, but how did i get there? what was the process?” and when it comes to those moments, victorino’s memory is clearer than crystal. he sat down before a recent workout at jetblue park and recalled his greatest hits. the sabathia slam for three months in 2008, sabathia was downright unhittable, going 11-2 with a 1.65 era in carrying the milwaukee brewers into the division series after being acquired in a july trade. but he wasn’t himself in game 2 of the nlds. victorino doubled off the third-base bag in his first at-bat, then watched from the dugout steps in the second inning as sabathia walked pitcher brett myers on nine pitches. jimmy rollins followed with a four-pitch walk to load the bases for victorino. “the whole second half of the season, the guy was absolutely dominant. nobody could touch him,” victorino said. “then, brett myers walks in front of me, and you’re thinking, ‘what just happened?
