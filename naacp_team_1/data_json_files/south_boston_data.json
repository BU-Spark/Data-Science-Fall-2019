what percentage along are you?’ i think maybe the advocates at the time gave a much rosier projection than was the case. whether it rises to the level of misleading the federal government, i’m not sure. but if there was some wrongdoing here, it might give the federal government the opportunity to say, ‘well, those federal funds were obtained through fraud,’ and demand repayment,” lynch said. “look, there are laws out there. if it rises to the level of criminality, a felony, then those people will have to pay the price. what was worse in terms of what i read is that one of the contractors was actually fired because they would not green-light it and they were asking the right questions. that is more egregious than willing ignorance, i guess.” lynch called the recently shuffling of the top deck at boston 2024 “an improvement” and “fresh start” for the city’s bid to host the 2024 summer olympics — a move he said he told mayor martin j. walsh was overdue. “there’s a sporting component of the olympics,” lynch said, “but there’s also a construction part, there’s a security part, there’s a transportation part ... there’s also a finance part. so i thought that the approach that we might take — and i suggested this to the mayor — would be to bring in mitt romney, bring in mike dukakis. i mean, i know a lot of people don’t like him, but he is a stone-cold expert on transportation. bring in katherine craven, who’s done a wonderful job with housing for these universities. she’s been incredible. bring in people from all these disciplines. maybe an ed davis on security, and ask them to serve for a dollar. just for a dollar. do this for a dollar to serve this effort. i think it might bring people’s emotions a little less antagonistic to the olympics and might start a new day. “i don’t think necessarily that choosing larry bird and jo jo white and david ortiz was the comfort that people were looking for. we’re really looking at the fiscal aspect of this and the managerial aspect of this. and while they’re very popular — they’re wonderful people — i don’t think they’ll be providing that level of assurance that will adjust people’s fears.” asked if he considered it a setback for boston 2024 that no concrete spending plan has been made public, lynch said incoming chairman steve pagliuca, co-owner of the celtics, and philanthropist jack connors, who will serve as an advisor, “know the pressure’s on, and i’m sure they’ll try to address some of those questions as quickly as possible, but i haven’t had a chance to talk to either one of them and i’m not sure what the timeline is.” bringing pagliuca on board is “a step in the right direction. i’m not sure it’s enough,” he said. “i think people want to know if the cost overruns occur, who pays? what’s the process? it’s an insurable event, so is there some type of reinsurance that if this doesn’t happen or that doesn’t happen, we have a policy we can rely on. i don’t know how they structure it, but that’s why we have all these smart people in place.” lynch called a potential 60,000-seat olympic stadium in andrew square in south boston “the elephant in the room. i’m not in favor of that. they’re saying they’re going to build that 60,000-seat stadium and then take it down. i find that hard to believe. i think the neighborhoods of the south end, roxbury, dorchester and south boston are all concerned about that stadium because that’s a huge impact on that area. and it’s an area that’s coming up now. it’s really been transformed over the last 10 years. “i still am not convinced that that can work in that location. there was some other talk about suffolk downs because they’ve lost so much business there. the blue line is inadequate to service the needs of an olympic stadium in that area, but that would be a perfect opportunity to really rebuild and redo the blue line to service that entire community. “i think east boston is one of the new frontiers along the waterfront,” he said. “that will see tremendous development over the next 20, 30 years. but, this is a statewide event and there should be some benefits that accrue to either lowell or lawrence or worcester or springfield. they’ve at least talked about the early rounds of some of these soccer matches and things like that being held in some of those areas, and there would obviously be upgrades necessary if that was going to happen.” asked about national security, on a scale of 1 to 10, lynch rated the threat of isis to america as “a 2 or a 3. if you look around the world, most of the attacks have been against law enforcement, military ... those types of attacks. i would think the proclivity of some of these individuals is to go after government, but i wouldn’t rule anything out. it’s a concern, don’t mistake me. we obviously have a need to tighten up our borders, no question about it. it’s not just from an immigration standpoint, it’s really a national security standpoint.”"}

confrontation with the boston marathon bombers days after the deadly attack and one suspect's furious escape in a stolen car that ended with him dragging his brother's body through the street. the testimony by watertown officers came hours after jurors in the federal death penalty trial of dzhokhar tsarnaev went to see the bullet-ridden boat he was found hiding in the evening of april 19, 2013. earlier that day, shortly after midnight, one officer spotted a carjacked mercedes suv on a quiet residential street. that set off a frenzied clash in which dzhokhar and his older brother, tamerlan, hurled explosives at police, including two pipe bombs and one pressure-cooker bomb similar to those used near the marathon finish line that killed 3 people and injured more than 260 others, the officers testified. joseph reynolds, the first officer at the scene, said he \"locked eyes\" with the suv driver, who was later identified as tamerlan tsarnaev. reynolds said tamerlan got out of the car and began firing at him. \"all i could see was muzzle flashes,\" he said. \"i couldn't count it. it was nonstop.\" the shots continued as other officers began to arrive, reynolds said. he saw a wick and a lighter and then watched as an object flew through the air, landed in the street and exploded, he said, shaking him to his knees. \"i could feel all the debris landing on top of me,\" he said. sgt. jeffrey pugliese said he cut through backyards to get closer to the bombers, and he eventually could see their feet illuminated by car headlights. he said he aimed at the ground near their feet in the hope that the bullets would ricochet into their ankles. but tamerlan saw him and came charging up the street, firing at him, said pugliese, who fired back. the two men came face to face, with only 6 to 8 feet separating them, pugliese said. but tamerlan had a problem with his pistol, the officer said. \"he kind of looked at his gun. he looked at me. we looked at each other,\" pugliese said. \"i think out of frustration, he threw his gun at me.\" pugliese said tamerlan began to run away, but he tackled him. tamerlan struggled as three officers tried to handcuff him, even though he was wounded and bleeding, pugliese said. that's when they saw the stolen car speeding toward them with dzhokhar behind the wheel, pugliese said. the officer stepped out of the witness box to demonstrate how he tried to pull tamerlan out of the way and how he rolled over to get himself out of the car's path. \"the black suv, it was right in my face,\" he said. \"i looked down, and i saw the front wheels were over tamerlan.\" dzhokhar ran over his brother and dragged his body 25 to 30 feet, pugliese said. he also struck a police car before he made his escape. tamerlan tsarnaev died of gunshot wounds and the injuries he received when being hit by the car. after a massive manhunt and door-to-door search, dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in watertown. a transit police officer at the shootout was gravely wounded and nearly bled to death. dr. heather studley, an emergency room doctor, testified that officer richard donohue was \"essentially dead\" when he arrived at the hospital. donahue had a gunshot wound to the groin and had lost nearly all the blood in his body on the street in watertown, studley said. studley said doctors brought donohue back by giving him large infusions of blood quickly, installing a breathing tube and giving him epinephrine. earlier monday, jurors went to see the boat, which was brought to a location in south boston. the associated press was one of two news organizations and three courtroom sketch artists allowed to see the boat and provide pool coverage for the media. the 18 jurors walked around the outside of the boat and peered inside, while tsarnaev, flanked by three attorneys and u.s. marshals, watched impassively from a table about 50 feet away. as a defendant, tsarnaev had a right to be present at the viewing. the red and white boat is covered with more than 100 bullet holes marked individually with small pieces of white evidence tape. one of the boat's two front widows is shot out almost completely. jurors took notes and then went two at a time onto a lift to look inside the vessel, which was on a trailer parked on a flatbed. inside the boat, they could see the note tsarnaev wrote denouncing the u.s. for its wars in muslim countries. the note, written in pencil, is speckled with bullet holes and stained with blood, though the writing was barely visible. prosecutors said another portion of the note was carved by tsarnaev into wood slats on the boat. it wasn't visible monday but is expected to be shown to the jury later. the judge ruled that the location of the boat could not be revealed to ensure the security of jurors and the defendant. the owner of the boat is expected to testify tuesday. tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings and the later crimes but said tamerlan was the mastermind who recruited the then 19-year-old dzhokhar to help him. prosecutors say tsarnaev was a full and willing participant. now 21, he faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted. the same jury that decides guilt will decide whether he receives life in prison or the death penalty."}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5dd728fa17f83a14e150302b"},"timestamp":1.425531744e+09,"story":"congressman stephen lynch today blasted hillary clinton’s decision to use a private email system during her time as secretary of state, saying the practice “presents the opportunity” for someone to hack the system and gain access to sensitive government information. “i have concerns, as i would with anyone in that position, doing what they allege she has done,” the south boston pol said this morning during an appearance on boston herald radio. “we don’t know yet if state department records, to what degree those were maintained on a private system. we’ve had other cases where individuals have conducted government business on their private emails and in those cases — i’m not saying this one — in those cases some government information was compromised. so there’s that danger.” though he said he “loves hillary clinton” and is supporting her presumed run for president in 2016, lynch told hosts jaclyn cashman and hillary chabot he felt her decision to use a private email account was “not a wise decision.” “it’s not good, that’s for sure,” lynch said. “certainly it presents the opportunity if someone was able to hack a private email system that did not have the infrastructure and the encryptions that a government system might have, so i’m concerned about that.” clinton’s use of a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state has prompted questions about secrecy and the rules that govern the communications of senior government officials. the associated press today reported the computer server that transmitted and received clinton’s emails traced back to an internet service registered to her family’s home in chappaqua, n.y. the highly unusual practice of a cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given clinton impressive control over limiting access to her message archives. it also would distinguish clinton’s secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including mitt romney and sarah palin, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by microsoft corp. and yahoo inc. government employees generally use servers run by federal agencies where they work. clinton has not described her motivation for using a private email account — hdr22@clintonemail.com, which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym — for official state department business. operating her own server would have afforded clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails. and since the secret service was guarding clinton’s home, an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking. but homemade email servers are generally not as reliable, secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers. those professional facilities provide monitoring for viruses or hacking attempts, regulated temperatures, off-site backups, generators in case of power outages, fire-suppression systems and redundant communications lines. a spokesman for clinton did not respond to requests seeking comment from the ap yesterday. it was unclear whom clinton hired to set up or maintain her private email server, which the ap traced to a mysterious identity, eric hoteham. that name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or internet background searches. hoteham was listed as the customer at clinton’s $1.7 million home on old house lane in chappaqua in records registering the internet address for her email server since august 2010. the hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential internet account as mrs. clinton’s email server. the former president’s full name is william jefferson clinton. the new york times reported monday that clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct state department business. the disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the federal records act. a clinton spokesman, nick merrill, told the newspaper that clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the state department after the agency asked for them. in theory but not in practice, clinton’s official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the u.s. freedom of information act. under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. since clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with clinton to turn over messages it can’t already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed. president barack obama signed a bill last year that bans the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they retain copies of messages in their official account or forward copies to their government accounts within 20 days. the bill did not become law until more than one year after clinton left the state department."}
