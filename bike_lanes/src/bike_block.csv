The contractor stated that they place the cones in the roadway only when trucks are coming to unload materials and equipment  and the cones should have been removed directly after the unloading.    The inspector told the contractor that in order to place the cones in the bike lane and have a truck there for any time  the contractor would need to get an occupancy permit.    The contractor stated that he would not cone off the roadway or bike lane without a permit again.

We worked very hard with the Longwood Medical Area to have continuous bike lanes as far as possible on Brookline Avenue.  This included removing about 30 parking spots on the far side of the road  approaching the Park Street intersection. Unfortunately because of the volume of cars  loading and parking needs near the Brookline side of Brookline Avenue  we were only able to add shared lane markings at this end.  Hopefully in the future we can return and have continuous bike lanes the entire stretch.  Please do not hesitate to call or email with any other questions.

As the entity in charge of transportation  our goal is to make sure people are able to move around the City on whichever mode fits them best  whether it be via bus  bike  personal vehicle  or on foot. So far  adding bike lanes has narrowed lanes or removed on street parking. There were only a handful of locations where lanes were removed and based on our analysis  these changes did not affect vehicular operations to any great extent. ,BTDT: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,BTDT_BostonBikes,BTDT,,, , , , , , , , , ,,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call

Closed date : 2018-12-27 12:26:00.667 Case Noted The primary intent of this project was to improve pedestrian safety along & across the Beacon Street corridor. To achieve a corridor that reflects the context of the downtown urban fabric and the goals of the City for a safer street  the BTD enacted a number of improvements to the design of the roadway. This was accomplished through the changes to the traffic signal phasing at intersections  the narrowing of crossings through the removal of a travel lane  improvements to sight-lines & visibility through daylighting  and the introduction of the parking-protected bike lane to encourage non-vehicular transportation choices.     Due to the heavy volumes of vehicles departing downtown in the PM peak who choose to make the right-turn onto Storrow Drive at Berkeley Street  it was required to maintain all existing vehicular lanes on the block on Beacon St between Arlington to Berkeley Sts. The introduction of a continuous bike lane from Arlington St would require the removal of curb-side parking entitlements.    After the Berkeley Street intersection  toward Massachusetts Ave  traffic analyses have shown that volumes are below the engineering threshold for a having the travel third lane. Community input has also lent support for significant reductions in speed on Beacon Street  as it is also a residential corridor. Removal of a travel lane has been shown to be a proven measure at reducing vehicular travel speeds.    Utilizing many non-vehicular modes in your mobility choices is greatly appreciated and further encouraged. Your commitment to remaining alert and observant is essential to maintaining safe conditions for all users across the City. ,Boston Bikes: Bikes - General; Safety Request,Transportation - Traffic Division,Boston Bikes,Bicycle Issues,BTDT_BostonBikes,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Arlington St & Beacon St  Boston  MA  ,3,1C,7,A1,Back Bay,14,5,0505,INTERSECTION Arlington St & Beacon St,,42.3594,-71.0587,Constituent Call

Closed date : 2015-09-25 10:08:57.07 Case Noted This work is at the intersection of Saratoga St  Barnes Ave and the MBTA Orient Heights Busway  and is part of the Neighborhood Safety Improvements Project - CIP 15-22.  The proposed improvement plan consists of constructing a neck-down on the NW corner with new pedestrian ramps and installation of a Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacon (RRFB).  The plan is aimed at improving pedestrian safety at this intersection by improving sight lines reducing conflict points  reducing the crossing distance and providing a flashing beacon warning motorists that a pedestrian is in the crosswalk.  There is also a benefit to bicyclists as motorists will have to transition through the intersection and yield to bicycles in the bike lane in order to access the exclusive right turn lane.  These plans are consistent with the Boston Complete Streets and Vision Zero initiatives.    The concept plan was developed during the East Boston Action Plan completed in 2008 and there were several meetings held at the time.  At these meetings  residents in the neighborhood expressed concern about the safety of pedestrians crossing Saratoga St at this intersection.  The plans were presented at a Neighborhood Council meeting held on May 18  2015 at the Orient Heights Yacht Club and  there were over 100 people in attendance a representative from PWD Engineering Division also attend the meeting.  The Council and the Boston Police Department were very much in favor of this plan to improve safety at this intersection. ,Contractor Complaints,Public Works Department,Highway Maintenance,Contractor Complaints,BTDT_Engineering_Request for Traffic Signal Study or Review,BTDT,,,INTERSECTION of Bennington St & Saratoga St  East Boston  MA  ,1,09,1,A7,East Boston,1,Ward 1,0112,INTERSECTION Bennington St & Saratoga St,,42.3866,-71.0067,Constituent Call

There is not enough room  curb to curb  to add a bike lane. The safest way to navigate a two lane roadway as a cyclist in this setup is to ""command the lane"". The sharrows are present to alert drivers that you have just as much right to be there as they do. The lane is not wide enough for you to ride at high speeds side by side. For two lane roadways  drivers who feel that a bicycle is too slow can simply change lanes to pass you.

Working with the Public Works teams  we've been able to secure the necessary equipment to clear protected bike lanes  in addition to the regular equipment that clears the rest of the street. On Beacon St  we plan to provide additional width to the parking lanes on both sides of the street to accommodate snow piles better and there's a 3-foot buffer between the parking lane and the bike lane to accommodate opened doors and smaller piles of snow. We will monitor how everything works after each snow storm to better understand how we can continue to do better for everyone. ,BTDT: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,BTDT_BostonBikes,BTDT,,,19 Beacon St  Hyde Park  MA  02136,12,08,5,E18,Hyde Park,10,Ward 18,1816,19 Beacon St,2136.0,42.2529,-71.1171,Constituent Call
