5958175,Cambridge,Bike Lane Obstruction,closed,"To Whom It May Concern,I have been cycling over the Longfellow bridge for many years. I was very glad to see the construction finish this past year, and the inclusion of a designated bike lane. However, the way the bike lane is constructed on the Westbound side of the bridge (headed from Boston to Cambridge) at the base of the bridge on the Cambridge side as the Land Boulevard connects back in creates for a very dangerous situation for riders. The bike lane takes a VERY dramatic ""zig zag"" and furthermore there is a raised curb in this section as well as standing plastic bike lane barriers.Many cyclists are afraid while navigating this zig zag in the bike lane, especially because the raised curb is so high. I have seen many cyclists on the shared ""Blue Bikes"" all but come to a stop trying to make this sharp turn, which creates a very dangerous situation for other cycles behind them. This is a heavily bicycled route.It is unclear why the lane was made with this ""zig zag"" feature. I think it would behoove everyone if it were reconstructed to be a smoother, straighter line from the already existent bike lane coming over the bridge.Sincerely,Leia Dwyer",06/07/2019 10:35:53 AM,06/03/2019 09:36:10 AM,06/07/2019 10:35:53 AM,"143 Main St Cambridge, MA, 02142, USA",42.362320673789597,-71.082851886749296,"(42.3623206738, -71.0828518867)",

Many mornings between 7:15 and 7:45, I have encountered a yellow school bus parking at the intersection of Windsor and Hampshire, on the right hand side of the street (headed southeast) right in front of Lord Hobo. This is a very narrow and busy intersection. The bus is parked right up to the corner, leaving no room for a right hand turn. Importantly, this also leaves no room for bicycles to collect at the top of the lane to wait for the light.This morning I took down the bus number, 158. I'm not sure if it's the same physical bus or driver every day but the recurrence is common and it creates a very dangerous situation for pedestrians, cars, and cyclists.

4728416,Cambridge,Bike Lane Obstruction,closed,"Dear Sir/Madame,I'm writing to report a bike accident that occurred on Thurs, July 19 on Broadway ST near the MIT campus.  I was riding on my bike in the direction of the Longfellow bridge. Shortly before the intersection Broadway and Anne St, I passed a construction site that was right adjacent to the bike lane (doing work, as it seemed, on the side walk). When I passed the construction site, at a relatively high speed, I hit a wooden log that was sticking out on the street from the construction site. As result, I lost balance and crashed onto the street.  I occurred bruises on my right elbow, right leg and upper back. On top of that, I have been experiencing lower back pain for more than 7 days now since the accident happened. This accident could have been prevented. First, the log that my bike hit was clearly sticking out onto the street, beyond the perimeter of the construction site.  Second, there was NO POLICEMAN on duty at the construction site when the accident occurred, even though the site appeared to be an active one. If you need to verify the course of events:  The accident should be listed in the accident log of the Cambridge Police as I had called 911 right after the accident and spoke to two members of the Cambridge Police who showed up at the construction site about 10min after the accident occurred.

5370014,Cambridge,Bike Lane Obstruction,closed,"Hi there. Categorizing this as a bike lane obstruction, but this is also an MBTA issue, and I hope the city can coordinate with them on this.The 66 bus route's northbound/outbound stop for Harvard Square is at the Johnston Gate bus shelter. However, I've noticed pretty frequently (in the evening rush hour, at least) that the 66 route coming from JFK will angle across the right travel lane and the northbound bike lane on Mass Ave to let passengers off about 300 feet south of the Johnston Gate stop. I assume this is because they are stopped in traffic due to the signal opposite Church St. Although stopping well south of Johnston Gate might be convenient for bus riders, this informal stop can lead to bikers suddenly mixing with alighting pedestrians in the bike lane (if the bus hasn't totally blocked the bike lane), and feels uncomfortable on a bike because of the squeeze of the bus. It also prevents cyclists from taking advantage of the red light up ahead so they can make a legal left turn across Mass Ave onto Church St. Could the city work with the MBTA to get the 66 to drop passengers at Johnston Gate only? Or at worst, could this stop be formally marked and signed so bikers know to expect this kind of interaction here?  Thanks a lot for your help.",02/11/2019 12:34:20 PM,02/06/2019 01:03:10 PM,02/11/2019 12:34:20 PM,"1400-1438 Massachusetts Ave Cambridge MA, 02138, USA",42.374096482942903,-71.118870317696604,"(42.3740964829, -71.1188703177)",https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0125/2654/Screen_Shot_2019-02-06_at_12.47.50_PM.png

This turns the block of Windsor into a stand still between two lights. Thus blocking off bike lanes in both directions, and causing cars to back up into traffic or come within inches of hitting each other and cars parked on the left hand side. Feel bad for the people that actually live here and have to listen to horns and yelling all morning.  Can the city step in here and find a solution for this? Too many near accidents of bikers, and or cars that happen almost daily. Feel bad for the person that is going to get pinned between a car and a yellow school bus. I understand this is a school but that doesn't give free reign to block a full lane of traffic. There is plenty of room on Broadway that these buses could idle in or set a space on Harvard St for these awaiting buses.

3736907,Cambridge,Bike Lane Obstruction,closed,"Not truly a bicycle lane obstruction, but close enough.  The motor vehicle pictured was parked in a clearly marked ""No Stopping Anytime"" Zone and over a hashed white buffer zone.  Parking in this location creates a severe reduction in visibility, such that cyclists are in extreme danger of being right hooked by vehicles attempting to turn from Ames Street onto Ames Place.  In fact, I was almost right hooked this morning myself.Please consider installing a couple of bollards or other ""more than paint"" devices to indicate this is a No Parking Zone.  Leaving parked vehicles here creates an extreme risk of severe injury, and perhaps more importantly, there is *nothing* that cyclists can do to protect themselves in this situation while using the protected bicycle lane as designed.If Cambridge is serious about VisionZero, this seems like a great place to spend a very small amount of money to get a big increase in safety.And yes, I did call CPD to report this vehicle.  That solves today's issue, but it does not prevent this from happening in the future, so this ticket should probably be assigned to Traffic & Parking or Engineering to come up with a more permanent solution.",09/29/2017 01:05:45 PM,09/28/2017 09:03:48 AM,09/29/2017 01:05:45 PM,Ames St & Ames Pl Cambridge Massachusetts,42.363524400000003,-71.087770500000005,"(42.3635244, -71.0877705)",https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0088/3949/IMG_20170928_083645.jpg

Either a police officer needs to be directing cyclists around the effectively closed road, or in egregious cases like this, the vehicle should simply be towed.  It's pretty obvious that this is not a legal parking spot, and if this vehicle were blocking the ""car lane"" it'd likely be immediately towed as a hazard.A simple fix might be to just put an orange cone or two down in the buffer near the beginning and end (to catch someone trying to reverse/parallel park) of this lane, making it even more obvious that this is not a space for motor vehicles to park.",08/03/2017 11:18:55 AM,07/31/2017 09:27:58 AM,08/03/2017 11:18:55 AM,"92 Ames Street Cambridge, Massachusetts",42.363802831440303,-71.087637758197005,"(42.3638028314, -71.0876377582)",https://seeclickfix.com/files/issue_images/0083/4620/IMG_20170731_091310.jpg

The bus was parked, with its flashers on, and the bus driver was standing on the sidewalk before boarding the bus. As I passed the bus, I kindly informed him that he was parked in the bike lane. He snarkily replied ""no, it's not a bike lane, we stop here too, good day"" and then shut the door in my face before driving off. I understand that there is an MBTA bus stop located here, but this is a private bus that was not stopping to pick up passengers but actually completely stopped (for who knows how long). It's one thing for buses to pull over at the stop, but another entirely to use it as a private parking space, especially for private buses.

After somehow not falling over or as far as I can tell, hitting his car, I came to a stop by the traffic island and directed the motorist to stop as well.  He admitted (I believe this was actually caught by my conspicuously mounted GoPro) that he never even turned his head to check his blind spot.This is not the first incident I've seen here, but this is by far the most dangerous one I've seen yet.If motorists cannot be bothered to act in a safe and predictable manner then the infrastructure should be adjusted to prevent their negligent actions from harming others.

There is very little right turn traffic here, it'd be very simple to take most of the right turn lane and turn it into a significantly safer protected cycle track.  For bonus points, the entire block could be re-painted to allow for some of the space to be reserved for a protected bike lane in the opposite direction as well.Obviously a full fix like I've outlined above is costly and impossible to do during the winter months, but it's trivial to throw some cones down and see what happens.  We could even do this today, assuming you have some spare cones.

3089113,Cambridge,Bike Lane Obstruction,closed,"Tried biking through Porter Square this morning and taking the ""Bike Left Turn Jughandle"".  I like the green paint, it's far more visible.  Unfortunately, it's 100% ineffective because traffic blocks the bike lane whenever the light is green for cyclists.This morning while I'm waiting at the light a 77 bus pulled up, behind another bus, with the rear passenger door opening up right in front of my front wheel.  A bus rider gets off and starts admonishing me for ""blocking her way"".  I'm riding a 100lbs cargo bike, it's not something that's easily moved, and even if it were, I'm not going to move out of the way from where I'm supposed to be waiting, the bus driver shouldn't have stopped here if they couldn't clear the intersection.  While all the passengers filter off the bus the bike signal turns green, yellow, and red.  Now I'm stuck waiting for an entire extra cycle, which at this intersection is several minutes long, which kind of sucks on a cold, below freezing morning, particularly when I'm trying to do everything correctly.The premise here is sound, give cyclists a safe way to make a left turn onto Somerville Ave.  I love the basic implementation, but it's not helpful if traffic just blocks your way.  Please consider retiming the lights and reaching out to the MBTA (the most frequent offender) to train their bus drivers *not* to block the crosswalk/bike lane here.",12/12/2016 09:31:29 AM,12/06/2016 11:11:38 AM,12/12/2016 09:31:29 AM,"Mass Ave @ Somerville Ave Cambridge, Massachusetts",42.3886696,-71.119629900000007,"(42.3886696, -71.1196299)",
3086881,Cambridge,Bike Lane Obstruction,closed,"Another bike lane obstruction in the same place as last time, right in front of the Draper Lab loading dock.  Also, for the record, it appears that the loading dock did have space for the truck to park safely off the street.I called CPD, where a dispatcher quite rudely said ""This is T&P's problem"" and forwarded me to a very long phone menu tree.  When I finally got through to an operator at T&P they were quite polite, and happy to send an agent to ticket, but had no idea of how to record this as yet another data point, so here I am doing that right now.  Please, Obstructed Bike Lanes should be treated as a priority (but obviously not emergency) dispatch.  I shouldn't have to listen to a long phone tree to report it, that wastes valuable  minutes to get an officer to the scene to attempt to educate the vehicle's operator.Finally, yet again, I'm going to request that you do something, anything really, at this location to prevent trucks from obstructing the bike lane.  Again, I'd love to see a simple experiment done with a few skinny, tall, orange traffic cones lining the bike lane.  It's cheap, easy, and not permanent if it doesn't work.  I see no reason why we can't try this out for a few days (unless it's heavy snow, of course!).Also, can we get an official ""Who to call?"" number, preferably just one number 24/7, so I don't need to remember if a particular office is open or not.
