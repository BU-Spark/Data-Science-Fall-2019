The proposed project will continue the study of one existing participant, will add two new contract-supported participants, and will likely include information obtained from at least one additional participant from a separate study. This significant increase in the number of participants will allow us to begin to reach more general conclusions about the feasibility of intracortical recordings as the basis of an effective FES user interface. The timing of our proposed two-year project is also fortuitous, for at least two reasons: (1) A new family of neuroprosthesis devices connected together by a networked design will begin human trials in a separate study within the next year, and this will also serve as the basis of an advanced neuroprosthesis for restoring arm movements to individuals with high tetraplegia (the group targeted by the proposed study) within the next several years. A high-performance intracortical interface could be easily interfaced with this advanced neuroprosthesis to complete a breakthrough rehabilitation treatment for these individuals. (2) The development of a fully implanted neural recording system is also approaching human deployment, which would alleviate concerns with combining an implanted FES system with a percutaneous BCI system, while also completing the long-standing goal of deploying a completely implanted, BCI-controlled FES system for restoring arm movements. The results of the proposed two-year project will thus provide critical information on the command and control algorithms needed to complete a fully implanted, BCI-controlled FES system that reanimates the arm and hand of individuals with complete paralysis.
  Over the next two years, we will further develop signal processing and decoder techniques that use multiple signal modalities to increase the robustness of control and can take into account the non-stationarities associated with cortical control. We will complete the development of a real-time, 11 DOF Dynamic Arm Simulator, and continue to develop computer-based visualizations that are immersive and compelling enough to the participants to allow relevant evaluations of both BCI and proposed FES controller algorithms before actually implanting a real FES system. We will explore several fundamental properties of our intracortical interface using these methods, including (1) determining how many arm DOF can be simultaneously controlled in a continuous manner and which coordinate frame (joint vs. Cartesian) is optimal for intracortical control, (2) evaluating the use of goal-based decoding as a way to reduce the cognitive burden on the participant, (3) examining the feasibility of controlling functional hand grasp and wrist movements to perform standard activities of daily living hand via the same BrainGate2 systems used for control of the rest of the upper extremity, and (4) testing the ability of these same intracortical recordings to effectively control tasks where the user must produce forces rather than movements, and/or interact with objects that have their own mechanical dynamics. At the conclusion of this study, we will have acquired significant information that will guide the direction of the field (and our own research activities) for several years to come.

Approximately two-thirds of these HIV aware persons enter medical care within a year of being diagnosed. The HIV medical care setting is thus an ideal location for delivering a sustainable behavioral intervention to large numbers of HIV-positive persons, with the goal of improving patients' health and reducing the potential for transmission of HIV infection. To reach this goal, a comprehensive intervention is needed that not only addresses sexual and drug risk behaviors directly, but also attempts to improve patients' retention in medical care and their adherence to treatment regimens.",,,,,,,,,,

 LXR agonist, GW3965 or IL-10. First PLGA-PEG-F polymers will be synthesized by the already developed techniques at BWH. These polymers will be used to construct nanoparticles via
 nanoprecipitation or double emulsion strategies. Encapsulation of LXR agonist in PLGA-PEG nanoparticles will be achieved via nanoprecipitation, while the IL-10 encapsulation is achieved by via double emulsion (water-in-oil-in-water) strategy; both the techniques were pioneered by the BWH group. First a series of nanoparticles with LXR agonist encapsulated in the PLGA core will be made via
 nanoprecipitation and studied for size, loading and encapsulation efficiencies. The best candidates will be short listed based on small size, higher loading and encapsulation efficiencies. Loading and EE will be measured by using HPLC. Further in vitro release profiles of agonist from these nanoparticles will be studied to decide the best compositions. A second series of nanoparticles with IL-10 encapsulated in the PLGA core will be made via double emulsion will be studied for size, loading and encapsulation efficiencies. Here BCA assay will be used to quantify the loading and EE of IL-10. Best nanoparticle with small size and high loading will be used for further in vitro release studies. Well characterized nanoparticles from the both will be used for in vitro studies to study the uptake and intracellular drug release. Further these nanoparticles will be shipped to co-PI labs at NY for further in vitro or in vivo studies. Also mouse model of atherosclerosis will be used to test the particle properties for plaque
 delivery, bioactivity of LXR agonist and IL-10 using LCM-RT-QPCR. Depending on the results the nanoparticle design and construction will be re visited. Further effect of LXR agonist and IL-10 released from the nanoparticles will be tested on the progession of atherosclerosis using mouse models by
 measuring end points like plaque size, cellular composition, fibrous cap thickness, inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines, UPR markers, apoptosis, plaque necrosis, in-situ efferocytosis and reverse cholesterol transport pathways. Further studies will be carried out to examine the plaque regression of atherosclerosis using mouse models.",,,,,,,,,,

 ( FFRDC ) services to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) for a project to
 establish and support the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network ( LAN ). The objective
 of the LAN is to align CMS and private payers in moving payment from traditional Fee for Service
 ( FFS ) methods to FFS-linked to quality, alternative payment models, and population-based payment
 to achieve the stated goals of delivery system reform. By sharing information about successful models
 and encouraging private entities to share their best practices, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid
 Innovation ( CMMI ) intends to minimize barriers to adoption of alternative payment models.
 The LAN has defined progress in terms of rebalancing health care spending flowing through four
 categories of health care payments, which are:
   Category 1: FFS with no link to quality and value
   Category 2: FFS linked to quality and value
   Category 3: APMs built on FFS architecture
   Category 4: Population-based payment
 To help move the field toward Categories 3 and 4, the LAN independently convenes Action
 Collaboratives (ACs) comprised of stakeholders that have prioritized a commitment to adopting
 alternative payment models. The action collaboratives are focused on specific actionable goals   such as
 implementation of the LAN s maternity episode payment model recommendations in select regions
 across the U.S., and providing support for primary care payment transformation with an initial focus
 on the CMS Innovation Center s (CMMI) Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) model. A future
 action collaborative will be focused on Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs.) This SOW is written
 to be generalizable to any Action Collaborative, regardless of subject matter.
 MITRE is the independent convener of LAN ACs, but operates in close partnership with CMMI and
 with guidance from the LAN Guiding Committee. The aim is to ensure that the virtual events
 orchestrated for AC participants create value for them, and move them closer to action by meeting
 their APM implementation goals and the agreed-upon, measurable goals.",,,,,,,,,,

The proposed project will continue the study of one existing participant, will add two new contract-supported participants, and will likely include information obtained from at least one additional participant from a separate study. This significant increase in the number of participants will allow us to begin to reach more general conclusions about the feasibility of intracortical recordings as the basis of an effective FES user interface. The timing of our proposed two-year project is also fortuitous, for at least two reasons: (1) A new family of neuroprosthesis devices connected together by a networked design will begin human trials in a separate study within the next year, and this will also serve as the basis of an advanced neuroprosthesis for restoring arm movements to individuals with high tetraplegia (the group targeted by the proposed study) within the next several years. A high-performance intracortical interface could be easily interfaced with this advanced neuroprosthesis to complete a breakthrough rehabilitation treatment for these individuals. (2) The development of a fully implanted neural recording system is also approaching human deployment, which would alleviate concerns with combining an implanted FES system with a percutaneous BCI system, while also completing the long-standing goal of deploying a completely implanted, BCI-controlled FES system for restoring arm movements. The results of the proposed two-year project will thus provide critical information on the command and control algorithms needed to complete a fully implanted, BCI-controlled FES system that reanimates the arm and hand of individuals with complete paralysis.
 Over the next two years, we will further develop signal processing and decoder techniques that use multiple signal modalities to increase the robustness of control and can take into account the non-stationarities associated with cortical control. We will complete the development of a real-time, 11 DOF Dynamic Arm Simulator, and continue to develop computer-based visualizations that are immersive and compelling enough to the participants to allow relevant evaluations of both BCI and proposed FES controller algorithms before actually implanting a real FES system. We will explore several fundamental properties of our intracortical interface using these methods, including (1) determining how many arm DOF can be simultaneously controlled in a continuous manner and which coordinate frame (joint vs. Cartesian) is optimal for intracortical control, (2) evaluating the use of goal-based decoding as a way to reduce the cognitive burden on the participant, (3) examining the feasibility of controlling functional hand grasp and wrist movements to perform standard activities of daily living hand via the same BrainGate2 systems used for control of the rest of the upper extremity, and (4) testing the ability of these same intracortical recordings to effectively control tasks where the user must produce forces rather than movements, and/or interact with objects that have their own mechanical dynamics. At the conclusion of this study, we will have acquired significant information that will guide the direction of the field (and our own research activities) for several years to come.

 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

 In August 2011, AHRQ sought to deploy and implement a program for the support and expansion of the adoption and use of a CUSP that can be applied to reduce CAUTI in hospitals in all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico through State-based or regional consortia/collaborative in a phased approach.  This work builds upon and expands the current activities to demonstrate the effectiveness of CUSP for CAUTI in twelve States.  This follow-on effort utilizes the resources and materials for CUSP for CAUTI that have been developed as part of earlier contract work for this expansion of the national implementation effort.  
 
 The total funding for Subcontractor s effort is $20,000 U.S. Dollars in the Base Year and $50,000 in the Option Year. Subcontractor is solely responsible for any costs for completion of the following tasks and deliverables in excess of this amount.  
 
 TASKS:
 
 1. Ensure the recruitment and continued active participation of at least 10 hospitals in the project.
 2. Obtain and maintain general knowledge of the project (goals, expectations, interventions, timelines, schedules, etc.) and serve as a liaison between the national project team and hospital units.
 3. Work with unit teams to assist with culture improvements and overcoming project barriers.
 4. Provide individual coaching with identified high outliers.
 5. Regularly participate in scheduled calls with the national project team and encourage participating hospitals to do the same.
 6. Work with extended faculty to develop specific state curriculum needs.
 7. Commit to the goal of reducing mean CAUTI rates in participating clinical units by 25 percent, and improving safety culture as evidenced by improved teamwork and communication by employing CUSP methodology.  
 
 DELIVERABLES:
 
 1. Provide a part-time project coordinator to function as the state lead.
 2. Monitor and coordinate with participating hospitals to assure their submission of:
 a. Monthly infection rate data that is current and 70% complete (or improving)

 c. Quarterly team check up tool data that is current and 70% complete (or improving)
 3. Submit the State Lead Monthly Status Report (Attachment E).
 4. Facilitate monthly coaching calls and establish agendas for them.
 5. Coordinate three face-to-face learning sessions (at the start of the project, at mid-collaborative, and at the end of the collaborative).
 6. Coordinate site visits to units as needed.

 overseeing all phases of the work at Harvard, in addition to being involved in other aspects of the
 project. As detailed in the project's management plan, Ors. Huskamp and Stevenson will continue their
 collaboration on hospice-related topics in the context of this project and will be in regular contact
 throughout the project period. Ms. Laurie Meneades will serve as the programmer at Harvard, also
 building off of her prior work in using the required Medicare datasets.
 The primary analytic tasks that will occur at Harvard under the direction of Dr. Huskamp center around
 the integration of the hospice ownership coding conducted by Dr. Stevenson and his team at Vanderbilt
 with the following administrative datasets: the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File; the Nursing Home
 Minimum Data Set; and Medicare hospice claims. The analyses will utilize these datasets from 2004

 Our mandate as a part of the Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis will be pandemic preparedness through addition to the current body of knowledge on influenza virus pathogenesis, host restriction, ecology and natural history, transmission, evolution and host adaptation, interactions between influenza virus proteins and gene segments, evasion of immunity, and induction of host responses by conducting novel research aimed at publication in peer-reviewed journals. Specifically, we will undertake the following tasks: 
 
 PROJECT.  Surveillance and Surveillance-related Research on Viral Disease Ecology, Evolution and Adaptation, and Transmission/Pathogenesis at the Avian/Mammal and Human/Animal interface.
 
 1) Carry out influenza virologic, epidemiologic and disease surveillance with an emphasis on rapid characterization of influenza viruses.
 
 2) Determine the natural history of influenza virus and role for wild birds in the spread of influenza virus.
 
 3) Investigate the viral and host determinants of viral transmission from avian to mammalian species and their emergence in the wild.
 
 4) Deliverables
 a. Characterized viral isolates and reverse genetics viral constructs.
 b. Animal and environmental viral sample and analysis data and metadata.
 c. Animal serology data and metadata.
 d. Full genome sequence of targeted and selected significant viral isolates and samples.
 e. Research publications, progress reports and final report.
 f. Active participation in Network surveillance-related activities.
 g. Active response to pandemic surveillance needs.
 
 
 For Non-Severable Option 18C   Pilot Project (0258-0576-4609)
 
 Tasks
 1. Influenza Sequencing Core Related Work
 a. Tufts University shall continue research studies to develop and establish a sequencing methodology for single particle viral sequencing to be implemented in CEIRS DIGS. 
 b. Tufts University shall contribute expertise and consultation where possible to develop the overall project sequencing capability.
 
 2. Influenza pandemic surveillance
 a. Tufts University shall expand influenza surveillance capacity to detect and isolate virus with pandemic potential, particularly H5Nx and related virus.
 
 Deliverables
 a. Repository of animal influenza viruses and associated metadata.
 b. Publications
 c. Progress and final reports
 
 Option 11A - Equitable Adjustment - 400 Animal Samples (0258-0647-4609)
 
 Project. Enhanced Alaska surveillance of wild reservoirs. 
 Alaska is situated at the crest of the Pacific Rim and is a known 'hybrid zone' for the exchange of virus from East Asia and North America owing to the mass migration of breeding birds. We will leverage our continued Alaskan surveillance to build a model for forecasting inter-continental introduction and identifying host populations at high risk of infection from introduced strains through the following activities:
 
 1) Carry out enhanced Influenza virologic, epidemlologic and disease surveillance with an emphasis on rapid characterization of influenza viruses: 
 a. Detect HPAI viruses, viral segments, or their derivatives in Alaskan wild bird populations. 
 b. Obtain viral isolates and/or sequence to enable continued genotypic and phenotypic evaluation of circulating influenza with pandemic potential. 
 
 2) Assess whether prior exposure to low pathogenic subtypes suggests cross-immunity to currently circulating H5 clade 2.3.4.4.
 a. Assemble pseudovirus for serological screening with representative H5 hemagglutinin.
 b. Assess antigenic distance between circulating H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses
 c. Model the risk of inter-continental transmission of H5 viruses into Alaska.
 
 3) Deliverables
 a. Characterized virus samples from wild avian reservoir species.
 b. Full genome sequence of targeted and selected significant viral isolates and samples.
 c. Pseudotype virus constructs for antigenic testing
 d. Research publication, progress reports and final report.",,,,,,,,,,

 EPA s Travel Efficiency Assessment Method (TEAM) is a method for estimating transportation emission reductions that relies on sketch-analysis of travel impacts in conjunction with the MOVES emission factor model. EPA has applied the TEAM approach in a number of cities to date, relying on the TRIMMS model developed by the Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR) at the University of South Florida to estimate travel impacts. The objective of this task is to assist three additional areas in applying the TEAM approach to either a transportation emission reduction or a GHG planning analysis including inventory development and assessment of ability to meet future reduction targets. 
 
 TASK 2: Update EPA Report: Methodologies for Estimating Emissions and Travel Activity Effects of TCMs
 The objective of this task is to make recommendations for updating EPA s 1994 document, Methodologies for Estimating Emissions and Travel Activity Effects of TCMs.  The 1994 document includes six types of TCMs: telecommuting, flextime, compressed work weeks, ridesharing, and parking management. The document provides equations for determining changes in vehicle-trips and VMT considering factors such as the market size, average vehicle occupancy, travel behavior prior to change, trip lengths, days per week, peak period fractions, etc. The section on emission factor development describes the use of the MOBILE1 model. It also describes a process for analyzing a package of TCM strategies; case studies; and a summary of TCM methods developed in California.
 
 TASK 3: Comparison of Transportation Sketch Models
 A 2011 EPA report, Potential Changes in Emissions Due to Improvements in Travel Efficiency, identifies nine sketch models or spreadsheet-based tools. It can be difficult to do  apples to apples  comparisons between tools because different tools include different strategies or specify inputs in different ways. Therefore, a comparison of selected tools would be extremely enlightening and helpful for agencies in understanding their options for analysis methods, as well as for researchers in further developing robust tools and methods.

 The above Milestone Payments will be made by HRET within 30 days ofHRET's receiving an invoice
 for same.  With respect to each Milestone, Subcontractor may not send HRET an invoice for the 
 Milestone Payment until Subcontractor receives from HRET a milestone invoice eligibility notice for 
 that Milestone, and any invoice must match the Milestone Amount, if any, set forth in the notice.
 
 3)          Pay For Value Generally.  Subcontractor understands and agrees:
 
 
 a)   That it shall not receive, and HRET shall not be required to pay, any performance  related 
 payment in connection with Milestone 2, Milestone 3, or Milestone 4 if Subcontractor has not fully 
 met that Milestone, even if Subcontractor comes close to meeting the Milestone.  Any appeals of a 
 Milestone decision must be brought by a Subcontractor within 30 days of the date of the milestone 
 invoice eligibility notice and must be based on the data available to HRET at the time HRET 
 determined Subcontractor's  eligibility for a Milestone payment and any Milestone Amount (if any);

 be deemed to be 75%.

 Note that Task 1 is reserved for ERG administrative activities in the original EPA Task Order. Thus, the
 numbering below starts with Task 2.
 Task 2: AVERT and User Manual Updates and Maintenance
 Under the new Task Order, the Subcontractor should be prepared to conduct the steps described below if
 directed by EPA.
 Respond to state beta tester comments. In the fourth quarter of 2013, AVERT and user guidance
 materials were delivered to five state environmental agencies for review and a  beta test.  The
 Subcontractor will finish characterizing the comments in consultation with EPA, respond to open
 questions as required, and modify both AVERT and guidance materials as deemed appropriate, with EPA
 guidance. The bulk of this work is expected to occur immediately upon issuance of the Task Order to
 support the release of AVERT in early 2014.

 The CALGB Group Chair's Office will be responsible for overseeing the work done by CALGB institutions and issuing appropriate payments for the completed work.  In order to complete the payments, data will be needed from the CALGB data management center, lung cancer tissue bank and Washington University.  
 
 Each site will be led by a clinician who acts as the principal investigator and who has direct access to potentially eligible patients.  A clinical research assistant (CRA) will provide administrative support for IRB approval and help clinicians in re-consenting patients.  
 
 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

 national project through providing expert input into the design of the improvement & evaluation 
 strategies & activities for HRET.
 
 Tasks:
 The current thinking around sustainability of quality and safety improvement initiatives emphasizes 
 the following five steps to improving sustainability: selecting changes that have achieved 
 performance thresholds that should be sustained, predicting their ""stickiness,"" developing the 
 infrastructure for sustainability, continuous ongoing measurement, and making changes to support 
 systems that will improve likelihood of sustaining the gains.

 Step One: Determine that a change has achieved acceptable levels of capability and reliability
 IHI will work with the 5-6 initial sites to determine which changes are to be sustained. The 
 desired changes are those which have reached adequate levels of capability and reliability. 
 Capability means that the change is producing the desired impact on patients or populations, and 
 reliability means that the change is consistently producing this level of impact. If a change has 
 not succeeded in reaching the levels of performance that you hope for your system, focusing on 
 sustainability will result in sustaining subpar performance. Conversely, when you have succeeded in 
 optimizing your system through a series of tests to adapt the changes, and these are reliably being 
 performed, a focus on sustainability will be important.  This first step will identify the changes 
 that are ready to be sustained.
 
 Step Two: Develop and use a sustainability prediction tool to understand the nature of the change 
 and context
 Once the changes for sustaining are identified, IHI will work with the initial sites to apply a
 sustainability prediction tool. Predicting sustainability yields quantifiable, actionable 
 information as to the likelihood that a change will stick in the system, identify opportunities to 
 improve its ""stickiness,"" or to improve the receptivity of the context. The NHS Sustainability 
 Model is the most widely known and used sustainability prediction tool. This tool captures the 
 essence of the key attributes of both the change and its context. Some minor customization and adap 
 ation to
 the Ambulatory Surgery project and context will be needed.
 
 · Once the IHI team makes these changes, the initial teams will use the tool and the information it 
 yields to strengthen areas of weakness in the change or context that are diagnosed through this 
 process. This tool is really meant as a way of beginning an important dialogue amongst the teams at 
 the surgery centers.

 Step Three: Develop the infrastructure for sustainability
 SustainabilitY. is the province of leaders at all levels in an organization. Developing the 
 infrastructure for sustainability requires developing the standard work for leaders particularly 
 those leading clinical microsystems (front-line service delivery units). Effective standard work of 
 leaders includes the following six elements:
 
   Standardization. Processes to define & disseminate standard work: what to do and how to do it. 
 Having well-defined daily, weekly, monthly, quarterlyd annual tasks (i.e., clearly defined standard 
 work) related to the particular change at hand. The supervisor has a clear sense of these tasks, 
 regardless of how they are outlined (in a daily checklist, a huddle board and huddle agenda, etc.).
 
   Accountability. Process to review execution of leader standard work. The organization has systems 
 to monitor whether staff are implementing standard work. This is crucial to maintaining process 
 control, understanding what training needs may exist, or to uncover processes that do not work 
 well. Managers use this information as the basis for
 
 Transforming health care through research and educatio.

 improvement of the work unit; evaluation of individual staff performance for promotion or 
 separation is secondary.
 
   Visual Management. Systems provide information to regulate current period performance in a visual 
 way with attendant daily communication system to ensure that all key staff are aware of mission 
 critical issues and take appropriate actions in their day. The unit has information to monitor the 
 performance of existing processes. Most often, clinical units track such information using visual 
 metric boards, displayed publicly or semi-publicly, that show key indicators which in tum align 
 with system-wide strategic goals. These visual metric boards are usually accompany by some form of 
 daily communication process, often in the form of a daily huddle with all team members, to ensure 
 everyone understands the mission ofthe unit and the key points of vulnerability to heighten 
 awareness and sensitivity of all staff.
 
   Methods for Problem-Solving. Methods for problems solvable at the frontline and skill in 
 improvement methods. Supervisors and frontline staff have methods available to solve problems as 
 they arise. For example, they use versions of root cause analysis and Plan-Do  Study-Act cycles to 
 solve problems. A3 is a popular Lean tool for this driver. Frontline supervisors and staff are 
 skilled in these tools and methods-with experts available to provide support as necessary.
 
   Channels for Escalation. Frontline staff identify & escalate issues that require management 
 intervention to resolve, either directly or through commission of a formal improvement project. Not 
 all problems are readily solvable at the frontline. A well  functioning management system includes 
 clear protocols to distinguish problems that should be escalated to higher tiers, and those that 
 may require dedicated improvement initiatives.
 
   Integration of Standard Work. Goals and standard work are integrated across
 organiz ;ttionallevels. Frontline leader standard work must be well-integrated with frontline 
 clinical standard work. And it must be nested and well-integrated up and down the leadership chain 
 within an organization in order to be continuously reinforced and supported.  In addition, by 
 ensuring integration above and below, the standard work of
 front-line leaders ultimately ensures alignment of all quality activities with the original
 organizational purpose.
 
 Step Four: Continuous ongoing control measurement of the change
 A vital behavior in sustainability is continuous control measurement to ensure that the process
 remains stable over time. Infrastructure and responsibility for this key activity should be built 
 into the leaders' standard work and the usual operations of the service unit. Some mechanism of 
 regular review of control measurement should be created and automatic trigger thresholds set to 
 alert observers to evidence for when a process/change fall beyond the control limits suggesting 
 that it is no longer being sustained.

 To sustain some changes will require changes to human resources including workforce composition or 
 role definition (job descriptions), information systems (how they are used, what data & reports are 
 produced, review procedures etc.), and potentially to long-term financing. During the steps 
 described above, these changes will hopefully become evident and can be built into the 
 sustainability plan and approach.
 
 All other  provisions  remain  in full force.
 
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement.

Throughout its history, VentureWell has been committed to supporting high-impact experiential learning activities that increase the acquisition and retention of I&E concepts. Since 1995 we have engaged a community of faculty and their institutions by convening conferences, hosting trainings and developing a national network. In addition, VentureWell supports emerging student innovators and has granted more than $7.5 million in hundreds of early-stage grants that helped to launch 180 student-led ventures based on scientific and technological innovations. These companies have gone on to leverage more than $620 million in federal and private investment and now operate in 51 countries around the world. Our expertise in the field has led to our work as the implementing organization for multiple federally funded programs with strong faculty training and high participant engagement (Epicenter, I-Corps , National Innovation Network , USAID Xcelerator). VentureWell is uniquely positioned to leverage these programs and networks for implementation of the I-Corps  training for the National Institutes of Health.

In order to complete the payments, data will be needed from the CALGB data management center, lung cancer tissue bank and Washington University.  
 
 Each site will be led by a clinician who acts as the principal investigator and who has direct access to potentially eligible patients.  A clinical research assistant (CRA) will provide administrative support for IRB approval and help clinicians in re-consenting patients.  
 
 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

Clinical sites for the United States Critical Illness and Injury Trials Group Program for Emergency Preparedness (USCIITG-PREP) have been recruited to perform this work. The work is divided into a Base Period and 4 one-year Option Periods.
 Base Period (years 1-4): There are four deliverables identified for the base period:
   In year 1, develop an intravenous antiviral treatment protocol to assess the use of intravenous (IV) antivirals (e.g., IV zanamivir) under an expanded access IND for critically ill patients with confirmed influenza using electronic case report forms (eCRFs) and a data
 entry user manual.
   Utilize pre-established infrastructure for broad coverage of clinical trial sites across the
 United States
   Utilize rapid data collection tool/mechanism for collection of safety (adverse events) and
 effectiveness (performance) data
   Collaborate with BARDA and BARDA-funded company sponsors of medical countermeasures on pathway for FDA approval/licensure under the Animal Rule to meet post-marketing regulatory commitments
 The bulk of this work will be accomplished in Year 1 of the Base Period; minor iterations of
 the work are required annually thereafter. Collaborators in the USCIITG-PREP network are
 tasked with coordinating reports and completing the work required at their respective sites.
 Deliverables specific for the Base Period include:
 1. Monthly - Progress reports to include financial information and research updates, due the 15th of each month with the first report due on November 15, 2014
 2. Yearly - Progress report for the past year's work to include both research findings, financial update, and publications and speaking engagements, due November 15th of each year
 3. Yearly - Operations plan for the BARDA-sponsored phase 4 field studies, due
 September 30th of each year if applicable
 4. January 31, 2015 - Final treatment protocol for treating critically ill influenza patients with IV zanamivir
 5. July 30, 2015 - A copy of the eCRF to be used during the 2015-2016 influenza season",,,,,,,,,,

 Each site will be led by a clinician who acts as the principal investigator and who has direct access to potentially eligible patients.  A clinical research assistant (CRA) will provide administrative support for IRB approval and help clinicians in re-consenting patients.  
 
 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

 The Subcontractor will provide a simple work plan (schedule and a few milestones) for the work described under
 Tasks 2 and 3 below. Some of the details of the work (approach, detail, etc.) will have to be worked out iteratively,
 so the Subcontractor should make and document assumptions as needed. The Subcontractor will participate in phone
 calls and email discussions with EPA and ERG as needed.
 Deliverables
   Work plan: October 31, 2013
 Task 2: Excel Tool
 The Subcontractor will create an Excel-based tool to conduct analysis similar to that done for Civil Society Institute
 study of 2011 ( Beyond BAU   ). This tool will be for internal EPA use for policy analysis/discussions and,
 likely, to support a proposal for the existing power plant GHG rule. The tool should allow for relatively easy
 scenario analysis through changes in key inputs such as cost of saved energy (program and participant), target firstyear
 savings levels, ramp-up duration/rate, start year, and perhaps one or two others identified through consultation
 with EPA. Default values should be established such that tool is immediately usable, but also can be readily updated
 as new supporting info is developed (e.g., new COSE assumptions, ramp-ups). The tool should generally be
 structured at a state level, but with consideration given to incorporation of utility data as available.",,,,,,,,,,

 1. SCOPE 
 As a part of the assembled Center for Research on Influenza Pathogenesis (CRIP), we have formed a unique animal influenza surveillance network structure that integrates research projects on influenza virus host responses, antigenicity, tropism and pathogenesis. We will dedicate resources and experienced personnel needed to rapidly detect influenza viruses by high throughput screening of collected samples and the phenotyping of select isolates. By contributing to an active and comprehensive animal influenza surveillance structure, we will be able to better understand the host range and ecology of influenza viruses, and the factors leading to the generation of pandemics. Additional research projects will further our knowledge of the determinants of influenza virus host tropism, pathogenicity, transmission, and impact on immunity needed to generate useful information to develop improved plans to mitigate the consequences of influenza virus outbreaks and pandemics. 
 
 2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS 
 Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services, qualified professional, technical, and administrative personnel, material, equipment and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of this contract, as needed to perform the tasks set forth below. Specifically, the contractor shall undertake work in the areas of animal and/or human influenza surveillance research, pathogenesis and host responses as requested by NIAID. 
 
 Option 11A (0258-0544-4609)
 
 Determine if and when wild birds and free-ranging marine mammals in California are infected with novel Eurasian viruses (H5N2, H5N8) recently detected in the Pacific Northwest. 
 
 Determine if relevant viral strains existed in birds in Alaska prior to current isolations and if virus persists through the migratory cycle in the North American Pacific Flyway.
 
 Obtain isolates for genotypic and phenotypic studies at Mt Sinai and elsewhere to assess threat potential.  Samples detected in our proposed surveillance studies suspected positive for high path viruses will be shipped to SPRL for virus isolation, genotypic and phenotypic analysis in avian hosts, and to ISMMS for phenotypic characterization (antigenicity, replication, pathogenesis and transmission) in human cells, mice, guinea pigs and ferrets, in order to assess their potential risk.  These studies require select agent certified BSL3+ facilities, available at ISMMS. These studies will also be conducted in collaboration with other CRIP partners with BSL3+ capabilities.  We will start by characterizing the already isolated H5N8 and H5N2 viruses.
 
 Key sample sites for MIT include Interior Alaska and the Copper River Delta (Alaska). Secondary sampling sites will be engaged by MIT with collaborating institutions (Obihiro University, Novosibirsk University, other) in the East Asian Flyway if studies point towards further investigating links to Southeast Asia.  Free-ranging pinniped marine mammals (n~100 Northern Elephant Seal), will be captured and sampled from the Channel Islands (UC Davis) off the coast of southern California, CA.
 
 Option 17B (0258-0555-4609)

In Phase 1 (24 months) of the Base Period (42 months), we will begin studies with a human Gut Chip that contains living human intestinal epithelial cells cultured within microfluidic devices that recapitulate the three- dimensional (3D) villus architecture and mechanically active microenvironment of the living intestine. Radiation sensitivity and MCM studies will be carried out using the gut chip in the presence or absence of a living microbiome. In addition, we will carry out experiments using a Bone Marrow Chip that is formed by engineering whole artificial bone in a living mouse, and then removing it and culturing it within a microfluidic device. Although we will begin with mouse marrow, we also will carry out studies to explore if we can replace the mouse marrow cells with cells from human cord blood to create a human Bone Marrow Chip.",,,,,,,,,,

 Work at MIT involve the design and synthesis of polymer, formulation of nanoparticles, generation of libraries of nanoparticles with cyclin A2 followed by screening tests on the libraries. The recently developed biodegrabale polymer nanoparticles by MIT group will be synthesized and optimized for transfection of cardiac cells using combinatorial end-modfication of poly (b-amino ester)s. Various parameters important for the gene delivery like, size, cytotoxicity, and uptake will be studied. Each cationic nanoparticle wtih a polymer:DNA ratio of 20:1 will be made and combined with pEGFP-N1 plasmid DNA binding followed with transfection study using cultured rat and human cardiac cells. Short listed three nanoparticle formulations with highest GFP luminescence in the tested cell types will be used for further anlaysis for nanoparticle size, DNA binding, DNA uptake and cytotoxicity to determine the best particle for the cardiac gene delivery applications. These in vitro transfection studies will be repeated in the presence and absence of Gelfoam hydrogel carrier for pericardial delivery and the effects will be examined by variation of transfection times.The best two nanoparticle formulation from the above studies will be scaled up and shipped to MSSM for further testing with 2-D and 3-D in vitro cyclin A2 gene delivery assays. These studies will examine the effects of cyclin A2 nanoparticles on cardiomyocyte proliferation and regional contractile function. In vivo biodistrubtion and toxicity in Balb c mice will be studied with these nanoparticles will be studied at MIT. Further these nanoparticles will be tested in vivo in porcine models.
 On the whole, the polymer synthesis, nanoparticle formulation, and screening tests will be performed at MIT, where all necessary expertise and equipment for nanoparticle synthesis and DNA transfection is available. Cells will be isolated and differentiated at MSSM, and shipped to MIT for testing if possible. In vivo studies will be carried out at both MIT and MSSM.
 Statement of Work for PEN Project 3
 Work at MIT will involve design and synthesis of different lipid-hybrid nanoparticles with PLGA core and PEG-phospholipid shell. Different compositions of statin, Iron oxide (IO), gold (Au) nanocrystals, detachable-PEGylated-phospholipids, and a macrophage targeting ligand, mannose containing PEG-phosholipids will be used to for the generation of library of theranostic nanoparticles. Initially macrophage targeted lipid-hybrid nanoparticles with smaller sizes and higher statin loading in the PLGA core will be developed and characterized for size, surface charge, loading, encapsulation efficiency. This formulation to will be further optimized for conditions to make nanoparticles with encapsulated IO and Au nanocrystals along with statin in the PLGA core. These nanoparticles stability, statin release, IO release and Au release will be studied in vitro. Futher surface switching by measuring the PEG detachability in the presence of MMP2 from atherosclerotic plaques and targeting efficacy of the resultant nanoparticles with exposed mannose groups on the surface will be studied in vitro. These theranostic
 nanoparticles will be screened for slow drug release, higher statin and imaging agent loading
 and PEG detachability. The short listed candidates will be used for cellular uptake
 measurements using various imaging or microscopy techniques. Also these nanoparticles will
 be studied for in vitro cytotoxicity measurements to measure the therapeutic efficacy. Further
 short listed candidates from the in vitro studies will be scaled up used to study for in vivo
 efficacy, imaging experiments which will be conducted at MIT or the co-PI lab in New York.
 Further histological analysis will be carried to assess the effects of the therapy using these
 theranostic nanoparticles.
 PEN Nanotech Core Statement of Work
 The Nanotechnology Core (Nano Core) objectives are: (i) to provide consultation to
 investigators of projects 1   3 on methodology for the formulation and optimization of drugloaded
 multifunctional polymeric and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles; and (ii) to provide
 investigators of projects 1 and 3 with the services to scale up the synthesis of their lead
 nanoparticles formulations in a sterile fashion suitable for efficacy studies in rabbits and pigs.
 Nano Core will provide consultation services including (a) technical advising, (b) nanoparticle
 formulation process development related to each project, followed by technology transfer to
 members of the PEN consortium. Additionally, the members of the project 1   3 research team
 may spend time develop skill set necessary after technology transfer in order to formulate
 nanoparticles in a reproducible and a robust manner. The process development for scale up
 manufacturing of nanoparticles will be done by the Nanocore in support of large animal studies
 proposed in project 1 and 3. An appropriate batch size for production of the drug-encapsulated
 targeted nanoparticles will be determined based on the scope of efficacy studies, toxicological
 studies, and stability requirements for their respective application. Suitable equipment and
 process parameters for nanoparticle formation, collection, drying and sterilization will be
 identified based on particle size, drug load, drug release kinetics, residual solvent levels and the
 ability to resuspend the dried nanoparticles. Experimental work will be performed to determine
 critical process parameters, equipment size, material requirements and scaling factors. Key
 process parameters dictating scalability include the starting concentrations of polymer and drug,
 the ratio of organic to aqueous phase and the manner in which the organic and aqueous phases
 are brought into contact. We will evaluate the effect of these parameters with the objective of
 maximizing particle yield and encapsulation efficiency while achieving the same mean particle
 diameter that was initially found to be optimal for each project as part of their small animal
 efficacy studies. Each large-scale batch will be subject to the same battery of biopharmaceutical
 tests as the small-scale formulations prior to testing of nanoparticles in large animals. We will
 also determine alternative approaches to sterilization with respect to their effects on
 nanoparticle quality, degree of sterility assurance and ease of validation.",,,,,,,,,,

Radiation sensitivity and MCM studies will be carried out using the gut chip in the presence or absence of a living microbiome. In addition, we will carry out experiments using a Bone Marrow Chip that is formed by engineering whole artificial bone in a living mouse, and then removing it and culturing it within a microfluidic device. Although we will begin with mouse marrow, we also will carry out studies to explore if we can replace the mouse marrow cells with cells from human cord blood to create a human Bone Marrow Chip.",,,,,,,,,,

In Phase 1 (24 months) of the Base Period (42 months), we will begin studies with a human Gut Chip that contains living human intestinal epithelial cells cultured within microfluidic devices that recapitulate the three- dimensional (3D) villus architecture and mechanically active microenvironment of the living intestine. Radiation sensitivity and MCM studies will be carried out using the gut chip in the presence or absence of a living microbiome. In addition, we will carry out experiments using a Bone Marrow Chip that is formed by engineering whole artificial bone in a living mouse, and then removing it and culturing it within a microfluidic device. Although we will begin with mouse marrow, we also will carry out studies to explore if we can replace the mouse marrow cells with cells from human cord blood to create a human Bone Marrow Chip.",,,,,,,,,,

 Health and Productive Aging Lab. Dr. Marfeo's research interests include measurement development, 
 work disability and healthy aging across the adult lifespan. Specifically, Dr. Marfeo's primary research goals  are directed towards understanding the interactions between environmental demands, adaptations, and 
 aging as it affects a person's health related quality of life including participating in the workforce. Since  2009, Dr. Marfeo has been a Co-Investigator on the SSA-NIH-BU projects aimed at developing a measure  using contemporary psychometric methods (item response theory and computer adaptive testing) in order 
 to capture a person s ability to work. Dr. Marfeo also received funding as a PI on a NIH R24 pilot project 
 that used the Round 1 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) to examine contextual 
 factors and community participation among older adults. Dr. Marfeo will collaborate with teams at SSA, 
 NIH and Boston University to develop project protocols, provide input on measurement development, 
 assist with content expertise (occupational therapy, work disability assessment, measurement 
 development) in the development of materials, contribute to manuscripts, and disseminate project 
 findings. Her effort on the project will be 20% FTE.

 In August 2011, AHRQ sought to deploy and implement a program for the support and expansion of the adoption and use of a CUSP that can be applied to reduce CAUTI in hospitals in all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico through State-based or regional consortia/collaborative in a phased approach.  This work builds upon and expands the current activities to demonstrate the effectiveness of CUSP for CAUTI in twelve States.  This follow-on effort utilizes the resources and materials for CUSP for CAUTI that have been developed as part of earlier contract work for this expansion of the national implementation effort.  
 
 The total funding for Subcontractor s effort is $20,000 U.S. Dollars in the Base Year and $50,000 in the Option Year. Subcontractor is solely responsible for any costs for completion of the following tasks and deliverables in excess of this amount.  
 
 TASKS:
 
 1. Ensure the recruitment and continued active participation of at least 10 hospitals in the project.
 2. Obtain and maintain general knowledge of the project (goals, expectations, interventions, timelines, schedules, etc.) and serve as a liaison between the national project team and hospital units.
 3. Work with unit teams to assist with culture improvements and overcoming project barriers.
 4. Provide individual coaching with identified high outliers.
 5. Regularly participate in scheduled calls with the national project team and encourage participating hospitals to do the same.
 6. Work with extended faculty to develop specific state curriculum needs.
 7. Commit to the goal of reducing mean CAUTI rates in participating clinical units by 25 percent, and improving safety culture as evidenced by improved teamwork and communication by employing CUSP methodology.  
 
 DELIVERABLES:
 
 1. Provide a part-time project coordinator to function as the state lead.
 2. Monitor and coordinate with participating hospitals to assure their submission of:
 a. Monthly infection rate data that is current and 70% complete (or improving)
 b. AHRQ Safety Culture surveys at the beginning and end of the project
 c. Quarterly team check up tool data that is current and 70% complete (or improving)
 3. Submit the State Lead Monthly Status Report (Attachment E).
 4. Facilitate monthly coaching calls and establish agendas for them.
 5. Coordinate three face-to-face learning sessions (at the start of the project, at mid-collaborative, and at the end of the collaborative).
 6. Coordinate site visits to units as needed.

 Evaluation of whether sufficient site-specific data are available (e.g., TSS monitoring data) to support development of additional site-specific selenium Kd factors.
  
 Development of Kd factor distributions for each immediate receiving water, based on aggregation of selected field study Kd factors that are intended to closely represent the immediate receiving water.
  
 Review of published studies to collect species-specific selenium trophic transfer factors (TTFs) for various species of invertebrates, fish, and birds.
  
 Development of TTF distributions for each trophic level that are intended to closely represent the likely food web present within each immediate receiving water. This effort will emphasize TTFs for those species that are known to be an endpoint of interest or that are known to be prey for a predator endpoint of interest (e.g., bird species for which we have dietary dose-response data on egg hatchability).
  
 Review and incorporation of applicable dietary dose-response data for species endpoints of interest.

As Westat s Subcontractor, Earley & Associates shall develop the KSN taxonomy to tag and compile a unified knowledge base for the HITRC and meta data searches for sharing documentation and reference materials on interest to CoPs.
 
 2. The subcontractor will return to Westat s project manager a signed Confidentiality and Non-disclosure Agreement for every person working on the KSN. Westat will forward the forms to Earley & Associates as soon as the client provides them to Westat (date TBD).  Subcontractor will return the completed forms within five business days of receipt.
 
 
 3. Subcontractor will work closely with Westat to describe the approach and methodology to be used, as well as to establish the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) clearly defining the work to be done by Earley & Associates for deliverables 2.6, 2.8, 4.2.5, 4.2.6, and 5.3.1. This input is essential to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the comprehensive work plan and guarantee that AHRQ contract deliverables are on time and within budget.
 
 4. Subcontractor shall provide the Westat Project Manager or her designee by noon of the fifth day of each month a written progress report on the activities accomplished during the prior month, how these accomplishments compare with planned milestones and a discussion of unmet milestones including their impact on the deliverables schedule and actions planned to alleviate the problem. There should be (at a minimum) summaries for each subtask in Attachment 2. Although official monthly invoices are not due until the 15th day of the month, the progress report should include sufficient budget information to allow Westat to evaluate costs and report this information to AHRQ/ONC in the KSN monthly progress report. If the fifth day falls on a weekend, the report should be delivered on the Friday prior.
 
 
 5. Subcontractor shall provide to Westat s Project Manager or her designee the deliverables specified in Attachment 2 at least five business days prior to the date from the Master Schedule.  The Master Schedule is attached; this schedule is expected to change based on the requirements of the project and the study sponsor (AHRQ).  Such dates will allow for Westat s review of the deliverable prior to official delivery to AHRQ.
 
 6. Subcontractor will maintain a log of standard operating procedures for taxonomy modification to be incorporated in project wide SOPs (Westat s delivery date is 6 weeks prior to end of Westat s contract with AHRQ, so Earley & Associated would deliver no later than 7 weeks prior to contract end). 
 
 
 7. On an as-needed basis, the subcontractor shall participate in scheduled conference calls with Westat and AHRQ to report on the taxonomy s progress and any issues that arise. 
 
 8. On an as-needed basis, travel to Rockville, MD for in person meetings with Westat.
 
 
 9. Prepare and provide technical, management, price, and schedule data and materials, and otherwise participate in and support the prime contract proposal activities as assigned. 
 
 10. Prepare and deliver a timely, responsive, and reasonable proposal in response to the Prime Contractor s reasonable requirements and the RFP. The Subcontractor s proposal shall be compliant with Client flowdown requirements.
 
 11. Provide an agreed upon number of competent personnel at the Prime Contractor s facility or at the Subcontractor s facility to assist in the effective and timely integration of data and material into the prime contract proposal.
 
 12. Participate in periodic proposal technical and management reviews and presentations as well as in the marketing and public relations aspects of the Program as requested by the Prime Contractor.
 
 13. Assist the Prime Contractor as requested in the development of a definitive subcontract statement of work for the proposed subcontract responsibilities and scope of work set forth in Attachment A attached hereto.

In Phase 1 (24 months) of the Base Period (42 months), we will begin studies with a human Gut Chip that contains living human intestinal epithelial cells cultured within microfluidic devices that recapitulate the three- dimensional (3D) villus architecture and mechanically active microenvironment of the living intestine. Radiation sensitivity and MCM studies will be carried out using the gut chip in the presence or absence of a living microbiome. In addition, we will carry out experiments using a Bone Marrow Chip that is formed by engineering whole artificial bone in a living mouse, and then removing it and culturing it within a microfluidic device. Although we will begin with mouse marrow, we also will carry out studies to explore if we can replace the mouse marrow cells with cells from human cord blood to create a human Bone Marrow Chip.",,,,,,,,,,

 Each site will be led by a clinician who acts as the principal investigator and who has direct access to potentially eligible patients.  A clinical research assistant (CRA) will provide administrative support for IRB approval and help clinicians in re-consenting patients.  
 
 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

 Scope of Work for Cohort 4 
 
 Background: Healthcare-associated infections, or HAIs, are a highly significant cause of illness and death for patients in the U.S. health care system. At any given time, HAIs affect one out of every 25 hospital inpatients. More than a million of these infections occur across our health care system every year, leading to significant patient harm and the annual loss of tens of thousands of lives, and costing billions of dollars each year. Some of the most prevalent HAIs include: surgical site infections (SSIs), Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infections (CAUTI), Central-Line Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). It is estimated that CAUTIs affect approximately 250,000 hospital patients per year, and approximately 40,000 CLABSI cases occur annually with a mortality rate from 12 to 25 percent.

We consider this project the first priority for UMB researchers Darrah and Campbell during the outlined study period (Mar 4, 2011 to March 3, 2013: Yr1: 03/04/11-03/03/12; Yr 2: 03/04/12-03/03/13). Both Co-PI Dr. T. Darrah and M.E. Campbell, M.S. express willingness to actively participate in NCS publications, reports, and intellectual property as coordinated by Drs. Landrigan and Miller. These researchers, with the permission of Drs. Landrigan and Miller will publish relevant metals and speciation data. 
 
 I. Background 
 Existing collaborations between PI Miller (URMC) and Co-PI Darrah (UMB) have focused on developing novel experimental and analytical techniques to evaluate the abundance and biokinetics of metal particles to the developing fetus. In our Metallomics Laboratory at UMass Boston, we (Co-PI Darrah and Ms. M.E. Campbell, M.S.) have successfully analyzed placental perfusate and tissue samples as part of previous NIH funded projects (NIH NICHHD R03 HD059027). Our contributions to the NCS Project 18 study, which directly support the current proposal, include the development of analytical methods to measure concentrations and species of Pb, As, Hg, Cd, in placental tissues by ICP-MS and GC-ICP-MS.
 
 II.  Technical Requirements
 The UMB subcontractor is responsible for determining the concentrations of toxic metals Pb, Hg, Cd, and As in placental tissue by a combination of ICP-MS and Hg analyzer. The use of ICP-MS enables simultaneous determination of multiple trace elements in each placental tissue sample at no additional cost, providing full screening for potentially toxic trace metals at the cost of only four metals. Speciation of Hg, As, and Pb will be evaluated by GC-ICP-MS in a subset of samples that exhibit total concentrations of each metal above pre-determined  toxic threshold  concentrations. In addition, we will evaluate the stability of tissue and metal concentrations at various times between birth and sample collection, and validate placental tissue sample collections methods for the Main NCS study and other academic placental projects. 
 
 UMB will be responsible for developing a written and video standard operating procedure (SOP) for sample storage, preparation, instrument calibration, analysis, and data processing. After the completion of sample analyses, a statistical evaluation of data will be completed by UMB PI Darrah and data will be reported to the UR data Management Core (18.7). Data will be analyzed to determine if there are detectable and statistically significant differences in metal contamination according to time elapsed between birth and collection and in different geographic areas included in the pilot study.
 
 III.  Specific Activities
 The Project 18-Placental Tissue proposal is designed to evaluate the influence of the previously stated variables (sample collection timing) on data quality and to generate preliminary data to demonstrate study feasibility in a time period of approximately 3 months following sample collection initiation. As a result, all analyses, SOP publications, statistical treatment of data, and database development will occur within the initial 6 months of the budgetary period.

   Health care policy research and analysis. Required expertise includes health care policy research and analysis. 
 These experts will participate in teams with MITRE and CMS to support design, policy decisions, and preparation for the deployment of the MIPS. SMEs will contribute to performance of tasks as described below.  
 Merit-Based Incentive Payment System Model Development Using Summary Data 
 Contractor shall work with MITRE, CMS and contractors as appropriate to design the MIPS payment methodology for the first year of the program. The design work requires modeling and simulation to project financial impacts for different performance score and payment adjustment scenarios. The development of the methodology will serve as an input into policy development, and the Contractor shall work closely with the policy team to ensure alignment of the simulation results and policy decisions. 
   Design and execute economic and quality impact simulations based on summary data.  The total number of simulations will be as mutually agreed upon, but is estimated at 8-10 simulations. 
   Define summary data needed from Electronic Health Record Meaningful Use (EHR MU), Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) and Physician Value-Based Modifier (VM) programs as well as any other summary claims data needed to support modeling.  
   Develop methodologies to soundly simulate quality impacts and economic impacts from multiple policy and scoring scenarios. The inputs and outputs of the simulations need to be flexible and able to assess both quality and economic impacts.

In order to complete the payments, data will be needed from the CALGB data management center, lung cancer tissue bank and Washington University.  
 
 Each site will be led by a clinician who acts as the principal investigator and who has direct access to potentially eligible patients.  A clinical research assistant (CRA) will provide administrative support for IRB approval and help clinicians in re-consenting patients.  
 
 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

 Each site will be led by a clinician who acts as the principal investigator and who has direct access to potentially eligible patients.  A clinical research assistant (CRA) will provide administrative support for IRB approval and help clinicians in re-consenting patients.  
 
 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

In Phase 1 (24 months) of the Base Period (42 months), we will begin studies with a human Gut Chip that contains living human intestinal epithelial cells cultured within microfluidic devices that recapitulate the three- dimensional (3D) villus architecture and mechanically active microenvironment of the living intestine. Radiation sensitivity and MCM studies will be carried out using the gut chip in the presence or absence of a living microbiome. In addition, we will carry out experiments using a Bone Marrow Chip that is formed by engineering whole artificial bone in a living mouse, and then removing it and culturing it within a microfluidic device. Although we will begin with mouse marrow, we also will carry out studies to explore if we can replace the mouse marrow cells with cells from human cord blood to create a human Bone Marrow Chip.",,,,,,,,,,

 In August 2011, AHRQ sought to deploy and implement a program for the support and expansion of the adoption and use of a CUSP that can be applied to reduce CAUTI in hospitals in all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico through State-based or regional consortia/collaborative in a phased approach.  This work builds upon and expands the current activities to demonstrate the effectiveness of CUSP for CAUTI in twelve States.  This follow-on effort utilizes the resources and materials for CUSP for CAUTI that have been developed as part of earlier contract work for this expansion of the national implementation effort.  
 
 The total funding for Subcontractor s effort is $20,000 U.S. Dollars in the Base Year and $50,000 in the Option Year. Subcontractor is solely responsible for any costs for completion of the following tasks and deliverables in excess of this amount.  
 
 TASKS:
 
 1. Ensure the recruitment and continued active participation of at least 10 hospitals in the project.
 2. Obtain and maintain general knowledge of the project (goals, expectations, interventions, timelines, schedules, etc.) and serve as a liaison between the national project team and hospital units.
 3. Work with unit teams to assist with culture improvements and overcoming project barriers.
 4. Provide individual coaching with identified high outliers.
 5. Regularly participate in scheduled calls with the national project team and encourage participating hospitals to do the same.
 6. Work with extended faculty to develop specific state curriculum needs.
 7. Commit to the goal of reducing mean CAUTI rates in participating clinical units by 25 percent, and improving safety culture as evidenced by improved teamwork and communication by employing CUSP methodology.  
 
 DELIVERABLES:
 
 1. Provide a part-time project coordinator to function as the state lead.
 2. Monitor and coordinate with participating hospitals to assure their submission of:
 a. Monthly infection rate data that is current and 70% complete (or improving)
 b. AHRQ Safety Culture surveys at the beginning and end of the project
 c. Quarterly team check up tool data that is current and 70% complete (or improving)
 3. Submit the State Lead Monthly Status Report (Attachment E).
 4. Facilitate monthly coaching calls and establish agendas for them.
 5. Coordinate three face-to-face learning sessions (at the start of the project, at mid-collaborative, and at the end of the collaborative).
 6. Coordinate site visits to units as needed.

In order to complete the payments, data will be needed from the CALGB data management center, lung cancer tissue bank and Washington University.  
 
 Each site will be led by a clinician who acts as the principal investigator and who has direct access to potentially eligible patients.  A clinical research assistant (CRA) will provide administrative support for IRB approval and help clinicians in re-consenting patients.  
 
 In consultation with the site clinicians, pathologists and tumor bank director, we have established firm guidelines on how to collect the tumor specimens for this project. Efforts were made to get the  meat of the tumor  right after the necessary diagnostic specimens are obtained in the operating room. This process will ensure that tumor nuclei rich material is harvested for the TSS project. Furthermore, the pathologist working with the director of the tumor bank or the tumor bank director will review the collected material to ensure that only cases that meet the criteria set forth by the disease working group are sent out to BCR. While it would be ideal to achieve a near 100% acceptance rate of the samples sent out to BCR, we do recognize that there may be discrepancies and not all tumors that passed through a stringent review at the repository may be acceptable to BCR.

In Phase 1 (24 months) of the Base Period (42 months), we will begin studies with a human Gut Chip that contains living human intestinal epithelial cells cultured within microfluidic devices that recapitulate the three- dimensional (3D) villus architecture and mechanically active microenvironment of the living intestine. Radiation sensitivity and MCM studies will be carried out using the gut chip in the presence or absence of a living microbiome. In addition, we will carry out experiments using a Bone Marrow Chip that is formed by engineering whole artificial bone in a living mouse, and then removing it and culturing it within a microfluidic device. Although we will begin with mouse marrow, we also will carry out studies to explore if we can replace the mouse marrow cells with cells from human cord blood to create a human Bone Marrow Chip.",,,,,,,,,,

 To address these barriers to access to sickle cell disease care, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) is adjusting the SCDTDP to a regional model.  The regional approach has been used by MCHB with other programs and will increase the reach of the program to provide access to a greater number of patients.  
 
 The purpose of this procurement for the SCDTDP Coordinating Center is to obtain services to gather data from and evaluate the performance of the SCDTDP grantees in addressing the three goals of the program, including: 1) increasing the number of providers treating persons for sickle cell disease for sickle cell related issues; 2) increasing the number of providers prescribing disease modifying therapies such as hydroxyurea; and 3) increasing the number of sickle cell patients that are receiving regular care with providers knowledgeable about treating sickle cell disease.  
 
 The contractor will be responsible for supporting data collection and reporting results of the SCDTDP as follows during the course of the Base Year and Option Years 1 and 2:
 
   Create a database with data elements and a data dictionary that allows HRSA to collect and evaluate data from multiple regions on meeting the goals of the program
   Contribute to and implement from and informatics perspective reporting strategies that allow HRSA to report results of the program to the general public

Sampling & Recruitment of Provider Practice Locations
 Clark will continue to provide technical support to PBS for the enumeration and subsequent characterization of provider-practice locations.  Specifically, Clark will work closely with the selected provider-practices (post-sampling) to fully characterize the catchment areas where eligible women reside using coarse-scale patient zip-code data and extant environmental and social data (see Study Data Collection).  This activity will expand on methods developed in previous NCS stratification work (Downs et al. 2010a).  This activity will be designed such that it meets and exceeds human subjects and privacy requirements, and is an activity that benefits both the NCS Study Team and the participating provider-practice.  Prior experience of community-based participatory research (CBPR, see Downs et al. 2010b, 2010c, 2009) has shown us the value of sharing the benefits   as well as the costs   of health research, and that the benefits should significantly outweigh the costs for all participants, including providers, and especially patients.
 B. Recruitment and Enrollment of Eligible Women
 Clark will assist UMMS in the design, testing, implementation and monitoring of recruitment methods tailored to local conditions, with cultural and socio-economic sensitivity (e.g. appropriate language and literacy levels for different socio-demographic subgroups within the target population sample).  We will use the findings from the PBR group, pertinent literature, and our knowledge of local contexts, and recruitment experience (Downs et al. 2010b, 2010c, 2009) to design, implement and monitor recruitment strategies and methods that pay close attention to cultural and socio-demographic diversity as well as logistical and ecological contexts (e.g. rural vs. urban settings).  
  C. Study Data Collection
 Self-administered forms and the collection of external records/extant data will be used to characterize the environments inhabited by enrolled women and children.  Since for the NCS,  environment is broadly defined to include biological, physical, chemical, and social/cultural influences on children s health and development  the major Clark contribution for this 12-month project period will be the design, testing, implementation and monitoring of methods for achieving comprehensive spatial characterization of these factors and contexts.  In order for these factors to be measured, self-administered forms will be used to delineate the spaces/micro-environments the target population inhabits during a typical year, at different times of the year.  Extant data will then be used to begin to quantify the different kinds of stressors and risk factors the population is exposed to in these micro-environments during these times.  In other words, this activity involves the mapping of time/activity/micro-environment patterns for the enrolled women and their children: Where do they spend their time, at different times of the year? What activities are they involved in? What kinds of stressors and risk factors are they exposed to   biological, chemical, physical, social, economic   and at what level?  
 To accomplish this we will use state-of-the-art synthesis of established methods that include: quantitative risk assessment (QRA); vulnerability assessment (see Downs et al. 2010 Risk Analysis paper); total human exposure (THE) assessment; systematic social observation (SSO); and various mapping and analysis techniques in Health Geographic Information Science (HealthGIS).

The capabilities of the instruments developed at Prime Contractor and engineering subcontractors will be evaluated using volunteers at or referred by Subcontractor #1 who have received radiation doses in the pertinent dose range. The focus will be on maintaining a very low false negative rate and improving (decreasing) the false positive rate for screening at the level of 2 Gy. Using these groups of human subjects, appropriate calibration curves can be established using in vivo EPR directly in the populations of interest using the devices specifically designed for such use. Additionally, methods appropriate for use in the field can be developed and the systems can be validated with subjects who have known doses of radiation to their teeth.",,,,,,,,,,

 1.1   Kickoff Meeting
 Within seven (7) calendar days of the award of this SOW, Contractor will conduct an orientation meeting and briefing for MITRE, including the MITRE Technical Manager overseeing this tasking. The completion of this briefing will result in, but is not limited to, the following:
   Introductions of key staff
   Brief overview of the SOW administration and reporting
   Review Involution Studio s understanding of the work to be accomplished under this SOW in order to ensure that all parties have a common understanding of the work to be performed and of the respective responsibilities and obligations of the parties to that end
   Review, along with the MITRE project leader, the agreed-upon method to resolve, track, and report on issues.
 The kick off meeting will occur in person and/or via conference call. MITRE will be responsible to provide logistics for a conference call. Contractor will be responsible for developing and sharing meeting summary notes, to be delivered electronically to the MITRE Technical Manager within seven (7) calendar days of the kickoff meeting.
 1.2   Project Reporting
 To share status, accomplishments, and issues, MITRE will provide support for the following ongoing and recurring project performance artifacts.
 
 1.2.1 Monthly Progress Reporting
 Contractor will develop and deliver a Monthly Progress Report (MPR) to the MITRE Technical Manager no later than five (5) calendar days after the calendar (previously calender) month end during execution of any MITRE tasking. The report shall document in a concise form the following elements:
   Status, hourly expenditures, and a brief description of all ongoing assigned tasks and efforts and what was accomplished for each assigned task during the reporting period in comparison to planned milestones; details about problems encountered and how they are being dealt with; explanations for any tasks that are behind schedule; anticipated challenges/problems including mitigation strategies; and problems or delays experienced and actions that are proposed to alleviate the problem(s);
   Current and proposed expenditures relative to original schedule and budget, including schedule or cost variances for each task compared to the original schedule and budget;
   Activities planned for next reporting period, including anticipated staffing requirements, level of effort, and cost.
 
 Deliverables to MITRE: 
 
   Kickoff Meeting Summary Notes (within 7 days after Kickoff Meeting)
   Monthly Progress Reports (within 5 days after the month; monthly thereafter)
 
 Task 2: User Research
 MITRE requires Contractor s leverage any existing user research completed by MITRE s product team as well as conduct user interviews, with participants identified by MITRE, to fully understand users  needs and goals. This is needed for Contractor to have a complete understanding of the users, the environment in which they work, and the context of use. Expected outcomes from Contractor s interview sessions shall include immersing the design team into the context of use for the software to better understand the current pain points, unmet needs, larger workflows, and general context of use.
 
 Deliverables to MITRE: 
   Bi-weekly (every 14 days) delivery of Contractor user research assessment notes
 
 Task 3: Concept Sketches and Mockups
 Critical to the success of this activity will be Contractor s ongoing and iterative creation of concept sketches that, at a high level, articulate the recommended design patterns for the CDS repository materializing during this project. 
 
 The software development activities that MITRE is supporting rely heavily on an agile project management approach. Agile project management follows an approach in which numerous stages of the software lifecycle are addressed in short two week  sprints  of activity. MITRE requires that Contractor participate in conjunction with MITRE s bi-weekly agile process.
