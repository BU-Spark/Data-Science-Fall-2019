<td valign=top>ORDER: Before me is the petition of the plaintiff, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, &#167; 118, &#182;1, seeking review of an order of a Superior Court judge denying her motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin a recall election to remove the plaintiff from her position as a selectman of the town of Townsend. Upon review of the petition and materials submitted with it, including the written order entered by the Superior Court judge, and consideration of the oppositions submitted by the defendant town clerk and members of the Townsend board of registrars (together, the municipal defendants), on one hand, and the other individual defendants, on the other, and after hearing, I conclude that the requested injunctive relief is warranted. A request for a preliminary injunction is addressed to the discretion of the trial court judge, and a single justice will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion in the absence of a clear error of law or abuse of discretion. See Jet-Line Services, Inc. v. Board of Selectmen of Stoughton, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 645, 646 (1988). With that standard in mind, I consider the narrow claim of legal error framed by the petition. Pursuant to St. 1995, c. 27 (the "Recall Act"), "any person who holds an elected office in the Town of Townsend... may be removed from office by the registered voters of said Town." The Recall Act establishes the procedures for initiating and conducting a recall election, and for the removal of an elected official from office if the results of the recall election direct that outcome. The plaintiff raises no challenge to the authenticity, eligibility or numerosity of the signatures of registered voters on the recall petition. The plaintiff's sole challenge to the recall petition is directed to sufficiency of the grounds set forth in the petition. Judicial review of the adequacy of grounds set forth in a recall petition is exceedingly narrow. See Donahue v. Selectmen of Saugus, 343 Mass. 93, 95 (1961); Mieczkowski v. Board of Registrars of Hadley, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 62, 64-65 (2001). The Recall Act is somewhat more restrictive than the cognate statutes involved in Donahue and Mieczkowski, supra. It describes particular grounds which are to be stated in any recall petition affidavit: "Lack of fitness, insobriety while performing official functions, involuntary commitment to a mental health facility, being placed under guardianship or conservatorship by a probate court; Corruption, conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude, conviction of bribery, or extortion; Neglect of duties, repeated absences from meetings without just cause, which shall include but not be limited to illness or regular vacation periods and Misfeasance, performance of official acts in an unlawful manner, or a willful violation of the open meeting law." St. 1995, c. 27, &#167; 2 (emphasis in original) The Recall Act further provides that: "In no case shall the exercise of discretion in voting on matters before the officer constitute grounds for recall." Id In the present case, the recall petition affidavit stated that the signatories sought recall of the plaintiff on the grounds of misfeasance and neglect of duty. Continuing, it explained that: "Whereas, Cindy King has neglected her duty to adequately represent the people of Townsend by refusing to argue in the affirmative for the public to be allowed a time for public communication at Board of Selectman meetings when no other board before this has refused to hear public comments or concerns and Whereas, Cindy King has impeded our Police Chief's ability to do the job he was hired to do by using her position of authority and by imposing her views on day-to-day management of the Police Department and Whereas, Cindy King neglected to support prior agreements made by the town with our Police Lieutenant and Whereas, Cindy King neglected to speak for obtaining an official and full background check on an applicant for a senior position with the Town of Townsend prior to signing the employment contract and Therefore, we the undersigned, consider these reasons to be an overall neglect of her duty, and have lost all confidence in Cindy King's ability to adequately represent our town as a Selectman and that she should therefore be recalled from her position on the Board of Selectmen." As noted earlier, the Recall Act is more restrictive than those at issue in Donahue and Mieczkowski, supra. In Donahue, the recall statute simply required the recall petition to state the grounds for recall, without description of or limitation on the nature of permissible grounds. In its opinion, the Supreme Judicial Court rejected the contention by the respondent board of selectmen that the required statement of "grounds" should be construed to mean "'substantial grounds' involving some wrong or serious impropriety.'" 343 Mass. at 95. The Court offered the following additional comment: "[t]hat the courts should conduct hearings and go behind the statement is not contemplated by [the Saugus recall statute then in effect]. In Mieczkowski, the Appeals Court rejected the contention that a statement of grounds, conforming to the statute, was inadequate because it was not sufficiently explicit. See 53 Mass. App. Ct. at 63. In the present case, the Recall Act (which we may presume the Legislature enacted with awareness of the earlier Donahue decision, see Gillette Co. v. Commissioner of Revenue, 425 Mass. 670, 677 (1997)) elaborates on the meaning of each of the grounds that may support a recall petition. While the parties disagree sharply on whether those elaborations constitute definitions of each term or merely illustrative examples, I need not resolve the precise character of the explanatory language it is enough to observe that the explanations following each of the specified grounds furnish at least a general guidance concerning how each should be understood, and the conduct or circumstances that each encompasses. In construing the meaning and effect of the stated grounds, I am also mindful that the Recall Act imposes an explicit limitation on use of the Recall Act itself: 11 [i]n no case shall the exercise of discretion in voting on matters before the officer constitute grounds for recall.'' Though that prohibition is cast solely by reference to voting, it reflects a concern that elected officials generally be afforded the freedom to discharge their duties as they see fit, without fear of facing recall, and that recall be reserved to those particular circumstances described in the stated grounds. In another somewhat analogous context, the Supreme Judicial Court has noted the limitation on the appropriate use of ballot initiatives: "'The people for their own protection have provided that the initiative shall not be employed with respect to certain matters. Unless the courts had power to enforce those exclusions, they would be futile, and the people could be harassed by measures of a kind that they had solemnly declared they would not consider.' We think that the question whether an initiative petition relates to an excluded matter is a justiciable question." Carney v. Attorney General, 451 Mass. 803, 820 (2008), quoting from Bowe v. Secretary of the Commonwealth, 320 Mass. 230, 247- 248 (1946). Viewed against that backdrop, I conclude that the recall petition affidavits in the present case do not satisfy the requisites set forth in the Recall Act. Taking the allegations in the petition as true, cf. Donahue, supra at 95, they do not describe "neglect of duty" in any manner resembling that term as described in the Recall Act.[3] Instead, they describe discretionary discharge of the official's duties in a manner other than as might be desired by the signatories to the petition. As the Superior Court judge observed in his order, the plaintiff faces the prospect of irreparable harm if injunctive relief is not afforded. I also conclude that enjoining the recall election is in the public interest, as it would be both disruptive and expensive to hold the election in circumstances where, as here, there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiff will be successful on the merits of her claim that the recall petition does not satisfy the requirements of the Recall Act. For the foregoing reasons, I conclude that injunctive relief is warranted. To that end, the municipal defendants, and those acting for them, are hereby enjoined until further order of this court, from holding a recall election to remove the plaintiff Cindy King from the office of Townsend Selectman, pursuant to the petition that is the subject of the plaintiff's complaint. Any action seeking to enforce this order shall be initiated in the Superior Court.[4] (Green, J.). *Notice/Attest/Lu, J. Footnotes 1. As she is the Townsend town clerk and a member of the Townsend board of registrars. 2.

I note that, though the recall petition affidavit alludes to misfeasance, none of the stated allegations suggests that the described shortcoming constitutes misfeasance, nor do any of the allegations describe behavior of the sort described as misfeasance in the Recall Act. 4. The plaintiff shall forthwith pay the $90 fee provided for by G. L. c. 262, &#167; 4.</td></tr>
