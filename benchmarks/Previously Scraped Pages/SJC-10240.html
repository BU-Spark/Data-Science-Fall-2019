<td valign=top>**NOTE: This Order amended 6/10/2009.)** ORDER (By the Court): Appellate defense counsel, Douglas J. Darnbrough, has requested an award of appellate attorney's fees and costs in the amount of $8,000. Pursuant to M.R.Crim.P. 15(d), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), appellate counsel for the defendant is entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees and costs for work in this case responding to the Commonwealth's appeal from the allowance, in the Superior Court, of the defendant's motion to suppress evidence. In this case, after the Appeals Court reversed the Superior Court's motion to suppress, Comm. v. Pina, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 653 (2008), we granted the defendant's application for further appellate review and affirmed the trial court's decision allowing the defendant's motion to suppress. In accordance with the procedures set forth in Fabre v. Walton, 441 Mass. 9, 10 (2004), appellate defense counsel timely filed a motion for attorney's fees and costs, an affidavit setting forth his hourly rate ($150 per hour), and a detailed accounting of the number of hours he spent working on the appeal before both courts (23.3 hours). Part of his submission was an affidavit and accounting by co-counsel, Elizabeth Doherty, to whom Darnbrough paid $4,500, an amount that included 59.5 hours of work and costs of $231.79. The Commonwealth filed an opposition. See Comm. v. Ennis, 441 Mass. 718, 721 n.3 (2004). (Fn.1) The sole argument the Commonwealth asserts in opposition to appellate counsel's request is that it should not be responsible for $1,261.14 which, it argues, are costs and fees associated with the defendant's application for further appellate review. (Fn.2) See Mass.R.A.P. 27.1, as amended, 426 Mass. 1602 (1998). In Comm. v. Gonsalves, 432 Mass. 613, 620 (2000), this court stated that rule 15(d) allows a defendant to recover fees and costs associated with "defending a claim on which he or she already has succeeded." The Commonwealth argues that, because the Appeals Court reversed the trial court's decision granting his motion to suppress, the defendant's application for further appellate review did not involve defending against a successful claim. According to the Commonwealth, nothing compelled the defendant to file the application and, therefore, it should not have to cover the costs and fees. We do not agree that costs and fees associated with the defendant's filing an application for further appellate review is not covered by rule 15(d). First, we conclude that the successful "claim" to which the Gonsalves case refers is the granting of the defendant's motion to suppress in the trial court. In any event, we do not read rule 15(d) as parsing out the award of fees and costs for a defendant who ultimately prevails in an interlocutory appeal taken by the Commonwealth. The opportunity to seek further appellate review is part of the appellate process, which the Commonwealth set in motion here (as is its right), by appealing from the decision of the trial judge. It would be unfair to penalize the defendant for continuing the appellate process, as is his right, where an application for further appellate review is the only vehicle by which his case could be heard by this court. Moreover, as the Commonwealth acknowledges, once this court granted the defendant's application for further appellate review, the Commonwealth was, once again, seeking a review of the decision of the trial court, against which the defendant had to defend. See Comm. v. Cahill, 446 Mass. 778, 782 n.5 (2006). In the absence of any other objection by the Commonwealth, taking into consideration the factors outlined in M.R.Prof.C. 1.5(a), 426 Mass. 1315 (1998), and carefully reviewing the papers appellate counsel submitted in this matter, we conclude that the hourly rates of appellate counsel are reasonable and that the request to be compensated for a total of 82.8 hours of work for appeals to both courts is reasonable. See Comm. v. Ennis, supra at 722 n.6. The total amount to be awarded is $7,768.21 in attorney's fees and $231.79 in costs. Payment shall be made by AOTC, to the extent that funds are available for such purposes, or by the Office of the Bristol district attorney. See Comm. v. Gonsalves, 441 Mass. 1007, 1007-1008 (2004). This order shall be enforced in all respects by the Bristol Superior Court. (Fn.1.: Appellate defense counsel did not serve a copy of the request on the Administrative Office of the Trial Court. Comm. v. Phinney, 448 Mass. 621, 625 n.5 (2007)("AOTC should be served with the request for fees and given an opportunity to be heard"). It does not affect our decision, given that M.R.Crim.P. 15(d), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996), mandates reimbursement for a defendant's costs and fees. See Comm. v. Ennis, 441 Mass. 718, 721 n.3 (2004), citing Comm. v. Lopez, 430 Mass. 244, 245-246 (1999) ("Rule 15(d) is mandatory...the Justices will determine only the amount of the award"). (Fn.2.: The Commonwealth states that the hours co-counsel spent are reasonable and does not challenge co-counsel's hourly rates. Attorney Doherty's hourly rate was approximately $72.)(Notice to counsel, Bristol Superior Court and AOTC.)</td></tr>
