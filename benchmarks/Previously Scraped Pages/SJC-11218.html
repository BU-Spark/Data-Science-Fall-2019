<td valign=top>ORDER (By the Court.): Following the release of our decision in Spaniol's Case, 466 Mass. 102 (2013), counsel for Bruce Spaniol, the undisputed prevailing party in this workers' compensation case, filed a petition for appellate attorney's fees and costs. General Laws c. 152, &#167; 12A, provides: "If on appeal to the appeals court or the supreme judicial court pursuant to section twelve the claimant prevails, the court shall allow the claimant, in addition to the award in the judgment, an amount equal to the reasonable cost of his attorney's fees, briefs and other necessary expenses that result from the appeal." We conclude that the petition should be allowed, subject to specified modifications. By way of background, Spaniol sustained injuries to his right knee, shoulder, and head on December 24, 2003, when he slipped and fell during the course of his employment at Fairview Commons Nursing & Rehabilitation Center. He began to receive workers' compensation benefits under G. L. c. 152, &#167; 34, for total incapacity. On September 11, 2006, he filed an additional claim seeking compensation for specific injuries under G. L. c. 152, &#167; 36. An administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (department) denied Spaniol's claim. He appealed, and, on the day of the hearing, he and A.I.M. Mutual Insurance Company (insurer) signed an "Agreement to Pay Compensation," which provided for the payment of a sum certain to Spaniol for specific permanent injuries under &#167; 36, plus attorney's fees and reasonable costs. The insurer issued Spaniol a check in which it reduced, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, &#167; 13A (10), the specific compensation award by 22% to partially offset the insurer's payment of Spaniol's attorney's fees. In response, Spaniol filed a claim under G. L. c. 152, &#167;&#167; 8 and 14, for reimbursement of the amount deducted from his compensation award, and for the imposition of penalties on the insurer. The administrative judge denied the claim. Spaniol appealed, contending that &#167; 13A (10) did not apply to compensation awarded for specific injuries under &#167; 36. Following a hearing, the administrative judge issued a decision in which he concluded that this interpretation of &#167; 13A (10) was correct. He ordered the insurer to reimburse Spaniol for the deduction taken from his specific compensation award, and he denied Spaniol's request for the imposition of penalties. Both parties appealed. The reviewing board (board) of the department reversed the decision of the administrative judge, concluding that &#167; 13A (10) and 452 Code Mass. Regs. &#167; 1.02 (2008) allowed the insurer to withhold up to 22% of Spaniol's specific compensation award to offset his attorney's fees. Spaniol appealed. He also filed with this court an application for direct appellate review, which was denied. The Appeals Court subsequently reversed the board's decision. Spaniol's Case, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 437 (2012). We granted the insurer's application for further appellate review to consider the interplay between &#167; 13A (10) and &#167; 36. By decision dated July 30, 2013, this court concluded that &#167; 13A (10) does not allow an insurer to withhold up to 22% of an employee's compensation award for specific injuries under &#167; 36 to offset the insurer's payment of the attorney's fees incurred by the employee. Spaniol's counsel now are requesting an award of $20,694.24 in appellate fees and costs: $19,917.50 in attorney's fees, and $776.74 in costs for their work on proceedings before the Appeals Court and the Supreme Judicial Court. The fees represent 84 hours of work by three attorneys, and 2.5 hours of work by a paralegal and a bookkeeper. In accordance with the procedures set forth in Fabre v. Walton, 441 Mass. 9, 10 (2004), the petition, signed under oath by James N. Ellis, Sr., subject to the pains and penalties of perjury, sets forth a detailed listing of the number of hours expended on each particular task, and the hourly rate for each attorney. Ellis has certified that the hourly rate for each attorney's time "is fair and reasonable and consistent with rates commonly charged by other practitioners in Massachusetts of similar experience and competence," but the petition includes no supporting affidavits from other attorneys to substantiate this assertion. The insurer opposes the requested fee award, contending that (1) the amount of time spent preparing a brief and appendix for the Appeals Court (22 hours) was excessive; and (2) the hourly rate initially billed by Ellis for work performed on matters before the Appeals Court was $250, but the present petition (which includes the Appeals Court work) reflects an hourly billing rate for Ellis of $350, which the insurer claims is inappropriate. Notwithstanding the amount billed, Spaniol's counsel are entitled to recover only reasonable attorney's fees and costs related to the appellate proceedings. See Fontaine v. Ebtec Corp., 415 Mass. 309, 324 (1993). In determining the amount of a reasonable fee, we consider "the nature of the case and the issues presented, the time and labor required, the amount of damages involved, the result obtained, the experience, reputation and ability of the attorney, the usual price charged for similar services by other attorneys in the same area, and the amount of awards in similar cases." Linthicum v. Archambault, 379 Mass. 381, 388-389 (1979). We also consider the interests the statute in question is designed to protect, and the public interest in allowing claims under that statute to proceed with competent counsel. See Stowe v. Bologna, 417 Mass. 199, 203 (1994). Here, these factors weigh in support of Spaniol's counsel's petition. The issue involved in this case -- the interplay between &#167; 13A (10) and &#167; 36 -- necessitated consideration by both the Appeals Court and this court, and was sufficiently new, complex, and important to the clarification of workers' compensation law to justify the fee request. Moreover, broadly speaking, an attorney's ability to recover reasonable fees and costs in a successful workers' compensation proceeding ensures that injured workers or their dependents will be able to secure competent legal representation and discourages protracted litigation. See generally Ellis v. Department of Indus. Accs., 463 Mass. 541, 546, 554 (2012); Green's Case, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144 (2001). We now consider the two factors that must be examined in assessing the reasonableness of an attorney's fee award: (1) the hourly rates charged, and (2) the time expended to obtain the results achieved in appellate proceedings. See Berman v. Linnane, 434 Mass. 301, 303 (2001) (discussing "lodestar" method of calculating reasonable attorney's fee by multiplying hours reasonably spent by reasonable hourly rate, and then making necessary adjustments). Spaniol's counsel have "the burden of showing that the claimed rate and number of hours are reasonable." Commonwealth v. Ennis, 441 Mass. 718, 722 (2004), quoting Society of Jesus of New England v. Boston Landmarks Comm'n, 411 Mass. 754, 759 (1992). A determination of a reasonable hourly rate begins with "the average rates in the attorney's community for similar work done by attorneys of the same years' experience." Stratos v. Department of Pub. Welfare, 387 Mass. 312, 323 (1982). "[W]here the award is provided for by statute and is assessed against the party having no contractual relationship with the attorney involved, the standard of reasonableness depends not on what the attorney usually charges but, rather, on what his services were objectively worth." Heller v. Silverbranch Constr. Corp., 376 Mass. 621, 629 (1978). Here, the petition for appellate attorney's fees presents hourly rates of $350 per hour for James N. Ellis, Sr., $275 per hour for Charles Berg, and $150 per hour for Philip Clark. The insurer only has challenged the hourly rate charged by Ellis, pointing out that an invoice dated March 26, 2012, for professional services rendered on this case from April 7, 2009, to March 16, 2012, sets forth Ellis's hourly rate as $250. However, the petition herein, dated August 12, 2013, for appellate work performed from January 7, 2011, to July 30, 2013, which encompasses some of the same work as appeared on the earlier invoice, sets forth Ellis's hourly rate as $350. Ellis has neither articulated a reason for this $100 increase in appellate attorney's fees, nor provided affidavits from practitioners in the field of workers' compensation law attesting to his experience and reputation and setting forth comparable hourly billing rates ordinarily charged by attorneys in this practice area. Accordingly, we reduce the hourly rate charged by Ellis for the seven hours of work that he performed to $250. Turning to the number of hours billed, Spaniol's counsel bear the burden of establishing and supporting the number of hours for which they seek compensation. See Twin Fires Inv., LLC v. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., 445 Mass. 411, 428 (2005). Each billed line item in the petition provides sufficient detail to describe the work performed. The insurer only has challenged the amount of time spent preparing a brief and appendix for the Appeals Court. More specifically, the invoice dated March 26, 2012, indicates that such preparation took 17.5 hours and was performed by Ellis (2.5 hours) and Clark (15 hours). However, the line item in the petition for the same preparation indicates that 22 hours of work was performed by Clark. We conclude that even 22 hours for the preparation of a brief and appendix for the Appeals Court is not excessive. The amounts set forth in the petition for appellate attorney's fees do not reflect charges unrelated to appellate work or indicate unreasonable expenditures of time. With regard to costs, we conclude that they are reasonable and adequately documented in the petition. The petition for appellate attorney's fees and costs filed by Spaniol's counsel is allowed in an amount that reflects reasonable hours expended on their successful appeals. See Berman v. Linnane, supra (reviewing court not required to allow or disallow fee petition item by item, but may "consider the bill as a whole"). Spaniol's counsel are awarded the sum of $19,337.50 in attorney's fees, and $776.74 in costs. Pursuant to G. L. c. 235, &#167; 8, postjudgment interest on this award shall accrue from the date of entry of this order. This order shall be enforced in all respects by the department. .</td></tr>
