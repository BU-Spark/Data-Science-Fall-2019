<td valign=top>ORDER: Before me is the defendant's emergency motion, pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 6(a), seeking a stay of harassment orders entered against the defendant in the District Court pursuant to G. L. c. 258E. Under Mass.R.A.P. 6(a), a single justice of this court wi11 review an order of the trial court under a standard equivalent to the one governing interlocutory review of preliminary injunctive orders under G. L. c. 231, &#167; 118, &#182; 2 (as performed in regular appellate review by a full panel). See Packaging Industries Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609, 614 (1980) (dicta indicating the equivalence of the standards); Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts, Inc. v. Operation Rescue, 406 Mass. 701, 709 (1990) (also equating review of stay decisions with review of injunction decisions under c. 231, &#167; 118, &#182; 2). I have reviewed the motion and the materials accompanying it, particularly including the thorough and thoughtful written memorandum of decision and findings on motion to reconsider issuance of harassment prevention orders, entered by the District Court judge on May 25, 2017. Based on that review, I conclude that the defendant has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his appeal challenging the harassment orders entered in the District Court on March 20, 2017, and extended on March 28, 2017. Based on the findings of fact entered by the District Court judge, which I adopt absent clear error (and which, in any event, do not appear to be contested by the defendant), it is plain that the defendant's conduct precipitating the plaintiff's application for the order was highly disturbing, and that (as held by the District Court judge) it met the statutory definition of "harassment" in the form of "fighting words" and "true threats."[2] There likewise is no cause to question the conclusion by the District Court judge that the threats made in the video posted by the defendant were made with an intention to cause, and did actually cause, abuse, fear or intimidation to the plaintiffs. However, in order for a harassment order to issue, a plaintiff must show that the defendant engaged in at least three such acts of harassment. See O'Brien v. Borowski, 461 Mass. 415, 426 n.8 (2012); Smith v. Mastarlerz, 467 Mass. 1001 (2014). On the facts found by the District Court judge, I conclude that the defendant has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his appeal in his contention that the plaintiffs did not make such a showing. The District Court judge concluded that the "three acts" requirement was satisfied by the inclusion of at least three threatened acts in the lyrics of the rap video he posted online. However, he did not commit any of those acts; it is instead the communication of a threat that constitutes the harassment in the present case, and that communication occurred as part of the single act of posting the video. The District Court judge also suggested that the requisite three acts might alternatively be found in the separate and discrete efforts undertaken by the defendant to (1) create, (2) produce, and (3) publish the rap video (with its threatening lyrics). To the contrary, the creation and communication of the threat are part and parcel of the same continuous act; indeed, the creation and production of the rap song would not constitute a threat unless and until communicated.[3] The defendant's motion has requested relief on an emergency basis, based on his concern that, without relief in the form of a stay, the harassment orders in their current forms will prevent him from attending his high school graduation, scheduled for Monday, June 5, 2017. By virtue of the emergency nature of the motion, I have not received an opposition from the plaintiffs (who appeared in the District Court without benefit of counsel), and without a hearing. In light of those circumstances, at present I am ordering only limited and temporary relief, pending a further hearing on the matter. Pending further order of this court, the harassment prevention orders are stayed, except that those portions of the orders requiring the defendant (1) not to abuse either plaintiff, and (2) to stay away from the plaintiffs' residences, shall remain in effect. The parties shall appear before the single justice on Friday, June 9, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., for further hearing on this matter. I close with the following additional observations. First, the relief afforded in this order derives solely from the state of the current factual record, as described in the memorandum and findings of the District Court judge, and the related likelihood that the defendant will be successful on appeal in arguing that the plaintiffs have failed to establish the required three acts of harassment. Any acts of harassment by the defendant during the period this partial stay is in effect could, of course, operate to satisfy the statutory requirement, thereby entitling the plaintiffs to a protective order even if the defendant should succeed in his current appeal. Second, the relief afforded by this partial stay operates solely to remove the impediment the harassment prevention orders created, as a practical matter, to the defendant's attendance at the scheduled high school graduation on June 5, 2017. I make no comment on the defendant's entitlement to attend the graduation, or on the prerogative of school officials to take whatever actions within their authority they may view as appropriate to ensure the safety of members of the student population or to conduct an orderly graduation ceremony; the school administration is not a party to this action, and I do not presume to direct their activities or to limit their authority. Conclusion. To repeat: Pending further order of this court, the harassment prevention orders are stayed, except that those portions of the orders requiring the defendant (1) not to abuse either plaintiff, and (2) to stay away from the plaintiffs' residences, shall remain in effect. The parties shall appear before the single justice on Friday, June 9, 2017, at 10:00 a.m., for further hearing on this matter. (Green, J.). *Notice/Attest/Ellis, J. Footnotes 1. D.P. 2. The details of the defendant's conduct, in posting online a rap video containing threats of violence directed against the plaintiffs and others, are contained in the memorandum of the District Court judge and I need not repeat them here. Suffice it to say that the lyrics of the video are highly disturbing and easily satisfied the statutory definition of "harassment." 3. The fact that the defendant posted the video by means of two separate social media platforms does not affect the analysis; assuming without deciding that the separate postings constitute separate acts of harassment, they still total only two. Nor does the fact that multiple third parties reported the posted video to the plaintiffs alter the equation, as there is nothing to indicate that any of those individuals did so at the direction of the defendant.</td></tr>

<td valign=top>ORDER: After hearing, the partial stay imposed by my order of June 2, 2017, shall remain in effect during the pendency of the defendant's appeal from the harassment prevention orders issued by the District Court in favor of the plaintiffs. I remain of the view that the defendant has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his appeal, as the record does not suggest that the statutory requirement of "three acts" has been met. I have left intact those portions of the orders requiring the defendant (1) not to abuse either plaintiff, and (2) to stay away from the plaintiffs' residences. Though (as I have said) I believe the defendant has demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his appeal, his counsel acknowledged at argument that he faces few practical burdens from the continued effect of those portions of the order, and my review still is of only those portions of the record in the District Court that accompanied the motion for stay; upon assembly of the full record and consideration of the appeal by a panel of this court it is possible that the additional information in the full record will cause the panel to assess the merits differently from my assessment on the critical question of the number of discrete acts of harassment. Balancing the interests of the parties during the pendency of the appeal, I believe it appropriate to leave intact the portions preserved by my June 2, 2017 order. (Green, J.). *Notice/Attest.</td></tr>
