<td valign=top>ORDER: Defendant Margaret Testarmata ("Defendant Mother") petitioned the Single Justice of the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, &#167; 118 to stay and vacate an order entered by the Probate and Family Court requiring her to undergo a mental examination pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 35(a). The Single Justice (Lemire, J.) temporarily stayed the order. Now, for the reasons below, the petition is granted and the order vacated with instructions. Background. This case involves a dispute over the trusteeship of two trusts and the invalidation of significant transactions and estate planning decisions by Defendant Mother, who is 88 years old. Plaintiff, Defendant Mother's daughter, claims that Defendant Mother lacks the capacity to remain in control of the trusts, and that the transactions and estate planning decisions are invalid for lack of capacity of Defendant Mother and undue influence by some of Plaintiff's siblings, also defendants in this action. Along with her Verified Complaint, Plaintiff filed a Motion for Mental Examination Pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 35(a). R.A. 5. The examining physician was to be Dr. Elizabeth Nasser. R.A. 213. After submitting several affidavits in opposition to the motion, Defendant Mother voluntarily underwent an examination by Dr. Nasser, apparently without consulting Plaintiff as to the nature or scope of the examination. Opp. 4-5. Dr. Nasser made detailed findings and concluded that Defendant Mother was competent and not subject to undue influence. R.A. 275-279. Defendant Mother submitted Dr. Nasser's findings to the court and argued that the motion for a mental examination was moot. R.A. 266 Plaintiff opposed the motion, arguing that she had the right to an examination by an independent expert, and proposed Dr. Julia Reade as said expert. After some procedural jostling, the motion judge (Rainaud, J.) granted Plaintiff's motion and entered a Revised Order on Motion for Mental Examination. The Revised Order ordered Defendant Mother to submit to a mental examination by Dr. Reade of no more than four hours at Defendant Mother's residence "as soon as possible." No other individual could be present during the examination. The court gave no guidance on the scope of the examination except that it "shall consist of tests, questions, and evaluations deemed appropriate by Dr. Reade." R.A. 378. In addition, Plaintiff attempted to subpoena some of Defendant Mother's medical records. Defendant Mother moved to quash the subpoenas or, in the alternative, enter a qualified protective order. After the parties' submissions were filed before this court, a different motion judge (Tierney, J.) found that documents had already been submitted in response to the subpoenas, and therefore held that Defendant Mother's motion to quash was moot. The motion judge also deferred action on the request for a protective order pending the results of Dr. Reade's examination. Finally, the motion judge indicated that she would conduct an in camera review of the records "to determine whether or not they contain any additional information that is relevant to this litigation." I review this matter for abuse of discretion. See Buster v. George W. Moore, Inc., 438 Mass. 635, 653 (2003) (discovery rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion). Discussion. The problem of isolation and, in some cases, financial exploitation, of the elderly is a serious one. At the same time, the entitlement of elderly individuals, no less than younger ones, to exercise their free choice with respect to their affairs is a matter of constitutional dimension. In allowing a court to order a mental examination of a litigant, Mass. R. Civ. P. 35 (a) takes account of the interests on both sides. An order for a mental examination is not a matter of routine. Mass. R. Civ. P. 35(a) permits a court to order a medical examination, but only after making two findings. First, the medical condition to be ascertained by the examination must be "in controversy." Second, there must be "good cause" for the test to proceed. See Doe v. Senechal, 431 Mass. 78, 81 (2000). Assuming without deciding that Defendant Mother's medical condition is in controversy, the motion judge in this case acted outside the scope of his broad discretion in prematurely determining that there was good cause to order the examination in this case. Satisfying the "good cause" prong requires more than simply demonstrating that the matter is in controversy or that the information sought is relevant. The movant also must show that she could not reasonably obtain the desired information in a less intrusive way. See id. at 84; see also Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U.S. 104, 118 (1964).[1] Here, Plaintiff had attempted to subpoena medical records from previous medical providers, which might have given Plaintiff all the information she needed with respect to the medical condition I have assumed is in issue. The court should have waited for a decision on those subpoenas before determining whether there was good cause for ordering a mental examination. After the motion judge issued the Revised Order, a second motion judge denied Defendant Mother's motion to quash the subpoenas. Instead of staying the medical examination to decide whether the records rendered the examination unnecessary, that judge deferred action on the medical records pending the examination. This is backwards. The "good cause" prong requires the court to determine whether other evidence--including, in this case, the medical records--renders a burdensome medical examination unnecessary. Upon remand, the court should examine the subpoenaed medical records before deciding whether a medical examination is warranted. And while evidentiary hearings are not always necessary before ordering a medical examination, see Schlagenhauf, supra at 119, the judge should conduct one on remand in this case to determine both the good cause question, and the extent of the burden on Defendant Mother. [2] Defendant Mother also takes issue with two elements of the Revised Order: the motion judge's failure to set any limits on the scope of the examination, and his decision not to allow anyone else to be present during the examination. These issues would become relevant should the motion judge order a medical examination on remand, so I consider them here. Mass. R. Civ. P. 35(a) requires the order to specify "the scope of the examination." Here, the Revised Order requires no more than that the examination "shall consist of tests, questions, and evaluations deemed appropriate by Dr. Reade." R.A. 378. The absence of any guidance for Dr. Reade raises concerns both that Plaintiff's expert will go on a "fishing expedition" Schlagenhauf, supra at 125 (Douglas, J., dissenting), and that the examination will not produce the evidence required to decide the case. Indeed, the latter is one of Plaintiff's complaints concerning Dr. Nasser's examination. See Opp. 13. Should the motion judge order a medical examination on remand, the order should contain detailed instructions for Dr. Reade concerning the scope and purpose of the examination and the information to be elicited. Defendant Mother also objects to the part of the order prohibiting any third parties from being present during the examination. [3] Courts are divided on whether a third party, including the non-moving party's attorney, should be present during a Rule 35 medical examination. On the one hand, some courts have held that permitting the presence of a third party during a medical examination renders the examination unduly adversarial. See, e.g., Greenhorn v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 216 F.R.D. 649, 654 (D. Kan. 2003). On the other hand, others have held that these examinations are inherently adversarial, which justifies the presence of the non-moving party's attorney. See, e.g., Goggins v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 2011 WL 1660609, *3 (M.D. Fla. 2011) (not reported in F. Supp.2d). Still other courts have allowed third-party doctors (but not counsel) to be present during physical but not psychiatric examinations due to the "particular nature of a psychiatric examination, which relies . . . upon unimpeded, one-on-one communication between doctor and patient." Brandenberg v. El Al Israel Airlines, 79 F.R.D. 543, 546 (S.D.N.Y. 1978). As an alternative to allowing a third party to attend, courts have sometimes ordered that the examinations be taped. See Greenhorn, supra at 654. Under the circumstances of this case involving the mental examination of an allegedly vulnerable older person, the motion judge should have required at least some form of safeguard for Defendant Mother, to protect her ability to cross-examine the expert and to ensure that the examination is not tainted by conscious or unconscious suggestiveness and the like. The motion judge is in the best position to determine in the first instance the appropriate form of safeguard. This safeguard might, for example, consist in either ordering that the examination be videotaped or ordering the presence of a third person (for example, Defendant Mother's attorney, Dr. Nasser, or some other mental health professional chosen by Defendant Mother). Since an appellate court would have to review the reasoning of the motion judge in order to evaluate the safeguard chosen, I hold only that, should the motion judge on remand order a medical examination, the absence of any safeguard is inadequate to protect Defendant Mother's interests. Conclusion. The Revised Order is vacated. The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing, and examine the subpoenaed medical records and any other relevant evidence, before deciding whether to order a medical examination pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 35(a). Should the court order such an examination, the judge shall explain in his order his reasoning, and the order shall comply with the instructions set forth in this opinion. (Rubin, J.). *Notice/Attest/Rainaud,J Footnotes: 1. Judicial interpretations of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including Fed. R. Civ. P. 35, are persuasive in interpreting the corresponding Massachusetts rules. See Doe, supra at 81 n.8. 2. Defendant Mother argues that Dr. Nasser's examination precludes Plaintiff from proposing a different expert. This is incorrect. See, e.g., Womack v. Stevens Transport, Inc., 205 F.R.D. 445, 447 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (medical examination by one party's expert does not eliminate good cause for another examination by the other party's expert). Nonetheless, the judge may consider the report from Dr. Nasser, and any testimony she may provide, in making the good cause determination in this case. 3. I am not persuaded that she has a constitutional right to have an attorney present.</td></tr>
