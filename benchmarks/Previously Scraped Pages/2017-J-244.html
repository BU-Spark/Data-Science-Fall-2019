<td valign=top>MEMORANDUM AND ORDER: The trial judge awarded attorney's fees, costs and expenses to the defendants, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, &#167; 6F. The factual and legal basis for the award were set forth in a carefully considered eight-page order. "Section 6F authorizes an award of reasonable costs and attorney's fees incurred in litigation when 'all or substantially all' of the opposing party's claims are 'wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.'" Fronk v. Fowler, 456 Mass. 317, 324-325 (2010). In connection with any such award, the court is to include the "specific facts and reasons on which the finding is based." G. L. c. 231, &#167; 6F. Section 6G vests the responsibility to review any &#167; 6F order in a single justice of the Appeals Court. G. L. c. 231, &#167; 6G. This review is "'de novo in the sense that the single justice may draw his or her own ultimate conclusions as to the merits of a fee award,' although the single justice is bound by the 'subsidiary facts as found by the trial judge.'" Fronk v. Fowler, supra at 327, quoting from Danger Records, Inc. v. Berger, 444 Mass. 1, 9 (2005). In making this determination, "the single justice considers an abbreviated record made up of the lower court's &#167; 6F findings and award, as well as other 'relevant' materials." Fronk v. Fowler, supra at 328. In undertaking my review, I have considered the trial judge's &#167; 6F order, the parties' submissions in connection therewith, as well as the trial judge's decisions on the merits and the relevant parts of the record filed in the underlying appeal. Based on my review of these materials, I conclude that the &#167; 6F award was warranted for the reasons stated by the trial judge. I also determine that that trial judge's findings of fact are solidly based in the record. In particular, this is Taylor's fourth lawsuit, challenging certain management fees paid to the defendants from 2009 to 2011. The present action was filed in July, 2015, more than three years after Taylor had notice of the basis for her claims. In February, 2016, the trial judge dismissed the complaint because, inter alia, Taylor's claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Notably, in allowing the motion to dismiss, the trial judge admonished Taylor to refile an amended complaint only "if she can do so in good faith, consistent with the points raised in this Memorandum of Decision and Order." The record is clear, however, that Taylor filed the amended complaint without a good faith basis to continue to assert her claims as timely. To the contrary, the record indisputably establishes that, at least by January 2012, Taylor's accountant and her lawyer (the partner of her trial counsel) were actively investigating the management fees paid to the defendants. Through her accountant and lawyer, Taylor had received an accounting of the fee payments and had threatened suit regarding the fees more than three years before the filing of this action. The defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, and the motion was allowed on the ground that the amended claims were barred by the statute of limitations.[3] The defendants sought attorneys' fees pursuant to section 6F from the filing of the original complaint in this action. The trial judge rejected that amount as overbroad. Instead, he awarded 6F fees and costs for the time period starting after the dismissal of the complaint because, after the complaint was dismissed and despite the admonition to conduct a good faith investigation, Taylor failed to do so at a time when it was patently clear that her claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The trial judge thus awarded attorneys' fees of $45,153.50, which were the fees after the first motion to dismiss was granted. In addition, the trial judge awarded fees of $5,345.00 for fees incurred in connection with the filing of the 6F motion itself.[4] I agree with the trial judge's well-reasoned opinion. At the least after the complaint was dismissed on the ground that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations, Taylor failed to conduct a reasonable investigation to warrant a non-frivolous argument that her claims were timely. To the extent Taylor did not recall that she had actual knowledge of her claims against the defendant by end of 2011 or early 2012, a good faith investigation (following the dismissal of her complaint) would have shown that her own counsel (who is the partner of her trial counsel) was actively disputing the management fees and threatening suit against the defendants more than three years ago. As the trial judge explained in the &#167; 6F order, "[i]t is clear that Taylor continued to file amended complaints and affidavits seeking to prolong this litigation without any good faith basis for doing so."[5] In sum, Taylor's claims were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith. The &#167; 6F award is therefore warranted. No argument has been raised challenging the specific amounts calculated by the trial judge. Fronk v. Fowler, 456 Mass. at 336. The judgment of the Superior Court awarding attorney's fees, costs, and expenses under G. L. c. 231, &#167; 6F for the defendants and against Jane Taylor, is affirmed. (Wendlandt, J.). *Notice/attest/Kaplan, J. Footnotes [1] Of the Jane E. Taylor GST Exempt Trust and the Jane E. Taylor Non-Exempt Trust, derivatively on behalf of Coolidge Properties, LLC and Stearnwood Properties, LLC. [2] JMB Group, LLC, and Black Oak Realty, LLC. [3] Taylor failed to timely appeal. She sought leave to file an untimely notice of appeal, which was denied for failure to show excusable neglect or merit to the underlying arguments. [4] Trial judge did not award appeals fees, to which the defendants concede they were not entitled. [5] In her opposition to the defendant's &#167; 6F motion, Taylor asserted that the defendants' motion was untimely. I agree with the trial judge that at least some of the delay is explained by the defendants' need to respond to Taylor's unsuccessful efforts to obtain leave to file an untimely appeal from the dismissal of her case. Moreover, Taylor was not prejudiced by the delay because the record in support of the fees was documentary, obviating the need for an evidentiary hearing.</td></tr>
