<td valign=top>ORDER: In this action under G. L. c. 258E, the plaintiff, then a Harvard PhD student, sought and obtained a harassment prevention order against the defendant, a Harvard faculty member. After several hearings and modifications of the order, the judge allowed the plaintiff's "motion to add" Harvard to the case and then entered a series of injunctive orders against Harvard, requiring it to take or refrain from taking certain actions relating to the plaintiff's completion of his PhD program requirements. Harvard appealed. Before me now is Harvard's motion under Mass.R.App.P. 6(a)(1) to stay the orders pending appeal.[2] For the reasons that follow, the motion is allowed. Background. Only an abbreviated version of the procedural history, which is lengthy and convoluted, is necessary for my resolution of the motion. In August of 2016, after a hearing, the judge found that the defendant had committed "harassment" against the plaintiff as defined in G. L. c. 258E.[3] The judge ordered (1) that the defendant "stay at least 100 feet away from the plaintiff and have no contact, direct or indirect, with plaintiff," and (2) that the "[p]laintiff is to immediately be fully restored to his position and research in the [defendant's] [l]ab with all the assistance, equipment, and supplies he had on March 10, 2016." The stay-away order created practical difficulties because it effectively banished the defendant from his own lab, which he is required by federal law to oversee. A series of hearings ensued, with Harvard participating as amicus curiae. On October 4, 2016, the judge entered a supplemental order, which provided for the plaintiff's transfer to a different lab. The judge ordered the defendant to release to Harvard "whatever funds are necessary to provide plaintiff with the same resources he had on March 10, 2016, i.e., two research assistants he had been approved for, and the S.M.A. mice (2 models KO and SMND7), necessary for his research."[4] For various reasons, however, the plan to move the plaintiff to a different lab was unsuccessful. Harvard then proposed that the plaintiff remain in the defendant's lab, subject to formal oversight by the defendant, but with a different thesis advisor. On October 17 the judge entered an order to that effect, stating that the plaintiff "shall remain in the [defendant's] [l]ab, supervised by the [defendant]." The order allowed the defendant to have access to the lab for three hours each weekday morning and complete access to his office and an adjacent classroom. It also reiterated the requirements that the plaintiff be provided with research assistants and the mice necessary for his research. On November 30 the parties appeared for another hearing, after the plaintiff moved to modify the October 17 order and to hold the defendant in contempt. The majority of the hearing concerned the issue that the plaintiff did not yet have the research assistants or the mice.[5] For that reason, on December 14, the judge entered a revised order reimposing the 100-foot stay-away requirement. On motion of the defendant, however, a single justice of this court vacated the stay-away requirement on January 30, 2017, and reinstated the provision allowing the defendant to have access to the lab in the mornings. Meanwhile, Harvard had assigned another faculty member, Dr. Sheila Thomas, to be the plaintiff's thesis advisor. In late December of 2016, the plaintiff sent Dr. Thomas an email stating, "For your harassing conduct towards me, I hereby notify you that you are no longer my interim thesis advisor." In January of 2017, when the plaintiff's program head told him that he needed a thesis advisor, the plaintiff began insisting that the judge's order required the defendant to be his advisor. Over the ensuing months, the plaintiff refused numerous requests from Harvard faculty and administrators, including his dissertation advisory committee (DAC), to meet to discuss the progress of his research. In several of his email responses, the plaintiff asserted that the Superior Court now controlled the terms and conditions of his academic progress at Harvard. As a result, and after notice and an opportunity to be heard (which the plaintiff declined), the Administrative Board of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences voted to place the plaintiff on academic probation with conditions. The plaintiff refused to comply with those conditions, even though he was warned that failure to comply would result in his withdrawal. On May 16, 2017, after the plaintiff failed to appear for another DAC meeting despite reminders, he was officially withdrawn as a graduate student. The next day, Harvard filed with the court an emergency motion to intervene for the limited purpose of seeking a modification of the December 14, 2016, order, and an emergency motion to modify the order based on the changed circumstance that the plaintiff was no longer a student at Harvard and could not have access to the lab. At the hearing on the motions, the plaintiff insisted again that the defendant must be his thesis advisor and that, absent such an arrangement, he would not attend any meetings. On May 31 the judge allowed Harvard's motion for limited intervention but denied the requested modification. The judge also allowed the plaintiff's "oral motion to add Harvard" and ordered Harvard "to comply with . . . [the December 14 order] pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P.71." The judge further prohibited Harvard from "tak[ing] any action contacting immigration or DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) or responding to immigration or DHS requests for information concerning this plaintiff without first obtaining leave of Court." On June 19 the judge amended the order to require Harvard to provide the plaintiff with "full access" to two research facilities. On July 7, after a hearing on several pending matters, including an order for Harvard and the defendant to show cause why they should not be held in contempt,[6] the judge entered a revised order, in which she reinstated the 100-foot stay-away provision vacated by the single justice. The judge further ordered, among other things, that: 1. the defendant "shall continue to serve as [the plaintiff's] supervisor, including being his thesis advisor . . . unless and until a new . . . thesis advisor is identified who is acceptable to" the plaintiff; 2. "[p]hysical meetings between [the defendant] and [the plaintiff] are required, provided they are in the presence of a third party"; 3. the defendant and the plaintiff "are to meet . . . to discuss [the plaintiff's] research at least once every twelve weeks, until [the plaintiff] completes his research or [the defendant] is replaced as [the plaintiff's] supervisor, including his role as thesis advisor"; 4. the plaintiff "is to be invited to, and [the defendant] must physically attend, 'periodic general lab meetings'"; 5. the plaintiff "is to be returned in all respects to the status quo he enjoyed as of March 10, 2016, and is to be allowed to complete his research and thesis work, to his satisfaction, and submit said work for publication and in satisfaction of his Ph.D. requirements"; 6. Harvard "shall vacate its May 16, 2017 withdrawal of [the plaintiff], and the terms of the academic probation that formed the basis for that withdrawal, and restore [the plaintiff's] status as a graduate student"; 7. "Harvard shall ensure" that authorities, including DHS, are "notified that [the plaintiff's] status as a Harvard graduate student has been restored"; 8. "Harvard is to discontinue any use of security guards at the facilities used by [the plaintiff], to the extent such use exceeds that which was in effect as of March 10, 2016"; and 9. "Harvard shall . . . obtain research assistance for [the plaintiff]," with the plaintiff "hav[ing] final approval over the research assistant(s) assigned or hired." Discussion. To obtain a stay pending appeal,[7] the appellant must show "(1) the likelihood of appellant's success on the merits; (2) the likelihood of irreparable harm to appellant if the court denies the stay; (3) the absence of substantial harm to other parties if the stay issues; and (4) the absence of harm to the public interest." C.E. v. J.E., 472 Mass. 1016, 1017 (2015). In evaluating the respective harms, the court must "look not to the degree of injury alone, but rather to the risk of harm in view of the [moving] party's chance of success on the merits." Packaging Industries Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609, 622 (1980). "It is the combination of likelihood of success and degree of irreparable injury that matters." Ibid. 1. Likelihood of success. I conclude, for two reasons, that Harvard is highly likely to succeed on the merits. First, Harvard will likely prevail on its argument that the judge's orders exceeded the scope of her authority under G. L. c. 258E. Under G. L. c. 258E, &#167; 3(a), "[a] person suffering from harassment may file a complaint in the appropriate court requesting protection from such harassment." In particular, "[a] person may petition the court under this chapter for an order that the defendant: (i) refrain from abusing or harassing the plaintiff, whether the defendant is an adult or minor; (ii) refrain from contacting the plaintiff, unless authorized by the court, whether the defendant is an adult or minor; (iii) remain away from the plaintiff's household or workplace, whether the defendant is an adult or minor; and (iv) pay the plaintiff monetary compensation for the losses suffered as a direct result of the harassment; provided, however, that compensatory damages shall include, but shall not be limited to, loss of earnings, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained or property damaged, cost of replacement of locks, medical expenses, cost for obtaining an unlisted phone number and reasonable attorney's fees." G. L. c. 258E, &#167; 3(a). Chapter 258E "was intended to protect victims who could not legally seek protection under [chapter] 209A." Seney v. Morhy, 467 Mass. 58, 60 (2014). Like chapter 258E, chapter 209A identifies four forms of relief that a judge may issue to protect a person suffering from abuse. See G. L. c. 209A, &#167; 3. Unlike chapter 258E, however, chapter 209A provides that a judge can issue orders "including, but not limited to" the four specified categories. Ibid. The "including, but not limited to" language was omitted prior to enactment of chapter 258E, strongly suggesting that the relief available under that statute is confined to the listed remedies. See Fernandes v. Attleboro Housing Auth., 470 Mass. 117, 128-130 (2014). The orders at issue here go far beyond those remedies and plainly exceeded the scope of the judge's statutory authority. Nor were the orders authorized by the general equity powers of the Superior Court. "It is a maxim that equity follows the law as declared by a statute." T.F. v. B.L., 442 Mass. 522, 533 (2004), quoting from Rossi Bros. v. Commissioner of Banks, 283 Mass. 114, 119 (1933). "Equity is not an all-purpose judicial tool by which the 'right thing to do' can be fashioned into a legal obligation possessing the legitimacy of legislative enactment." Id. at 533-534, quoting from Freeman v. Chaplic, 388 Mass. 398, 406 n.15 (1983). See McCarthy v. Governor, 471 Mass. 1008, 1011 (2015) ("court's equitable powers may not be used to provide relief that is contrary to statutory or constitutional requirements"). Even were I to assume, despite the plain language of chapter 258E, that the judge had some equitable authority to go beyond the statutory remedies, the injunctions she entered (forcing the defendant to be the plaintiff's thesis advisor, ordering Harvard to vacate its disciplinary decision, barring the use of security guards, to name a few) have no reasonable relation to the purpose of the statute. See O'Brien v. Borowski, 461 Mass. 415, 419-420 (2012). Whatever the permissible bounds of a court's equitable authority in chapter 258E proceedings, the orders here far exceeded them. This is especially true in light of the fact that Harvard was not named in the underlying complaint, which is the second reason it has a likelihood of prevailing on appeal. Passing the question whether a university can be a proper defendant in a chapter 258E proceeding, Harvard was not so designated, was not served with process, and was not afforded a hearing on the merits of the complaint. Contrary to the plaintiff's arguments and the judge's reasoning, Harvard did not subject itself to the orders by participating in the case as an amicus curiae but declining to intervene. It is evident from the record that Harvard's participation was necessitated by the judge's original order that the "[p]laintiff is to immediately be fully restored to his position and research in the [defendant's] [l]ab with all the assistance, equipment, and supplies he had on March 10, 2016" -- relief that could only be effectuated with the university's involvement. More fundamentally, Harvard had no obligation to intervene: with rare exceptions "a party seeking a judgment binding on another cannot obligate that person to intervene; he must be joined." Martin v. Wilks, 490 U.S. 755, 763 (1989). Cf. Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Ass'n v. Norrington, 395 Mass. 751, 754 (1985), quoting from Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 327 n.7 (1979) ("It is a violation of due process for a judgment to be binding on a litigant who was not a party or a privy and therefore has never had an opportunity to be heard"). Although the judge purported to add Harvard to the case under Mass.R.Civ.P. 71, that rule provides only that an order is binding on a nonparty if it "may be lawfully enforced against" that nonparty. As stated in the reporter's notes, "Rule 71 does not purport to affect the general rule that ordinarily a judgment may be enforced only against a party." 1973 Reporter's Notes to Mass.R.Civ.P. 71. This is not one of those "rare cases" warranting an exception to that general rule. Ibid. 2. Balancing of harms. Harvard has demonstrated that it will suffer irreparable harm if I do not issue a stay. By ordering that Harvard reinstate the plaintiff as a graduate student and asserting control over the terms of his academic progress, the judge intruded into the sensitive and complicated area of student-university relationships. Courts must be "chary about interfering with academic and disciplinary decisions made by private colleges and universities." Schaer v. Brandeis University, 432 Mass. 474, 482 (2000) (quotation omitted). As the judge acknowledged, her orders did not exempt the plaintiff from complying with the rules and regulations of the graduate program. It is undisputed that the plaintiff did not so comply, not even with basic requirements such as meeting periodically with his DAC. Harvard was entitled to sanction him accordingly. Ibid., quoting from Coveney v. President & Trustees of the College of the Holy Cross, 388 Mass. 16, 20 ("A college must have broad discretion in determining appropriate sanctions for violations of its policies"). While I accept the plaintiff's assertion that his student visa will be jeopardized if his withdrawal is not vacated, that harm does not outweigh the countervailing harms to Harvard if the orders are not stayed. Harvard withdrew the plaintiff for reasons independent of this proceeding, i.e., his failure to comply with the university's rules and regulations. The judge had no authority under chapter 258E to interfere with that decision. I also note that the record reflects efforts from Harvard officials to help the plaintiff apply for readmission, but he refused to avail himself of that opportunity. The balancing of harms thus weighs heavily in favor of entering the stay, especially given the strength of Harvard's arguments on the merits. See Packaging Industries Group, 380 Mass. at 622. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the following orders are stayed pending resolution of the appeal: (1) paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the December 14, 2016, order (dated December 5, 2016); (2) the May 31, 2017, order; (3) the June 19, 2017, order; and (4) paragraphs 2 and 3 of the July 7, 2017, order.[8]. Motion for stay pending appeal allowed. (Shin, J.). *Notice/Attest Footnotes: 1. Harvard appears as a limited intervenor and as a nonparty "added" to the case by the judge. 2. Specifically, Harvard moves to stay the orders entered on December 14, 2016 (dated December 5, 2016), May 31, 2017, June 19, 2017, and July 7, 2017. 3. The defendant appealed from the judge's underlying decision. The merits of his appeal are not before me. 4. In addition, the order, as well as all of the judge's subsequent orders, "precluded [the defendant] from using in any fashion any of plaintiff's research, including but not limited to publications, not even in an abstract." 5. At this hearing the judge barred Harvard's counsel from participating unless Harvard filed a motion to intervene. The defendant's counsel conveyed to the judge his understanding that Harvard had ordered the mice, which were specific strains that had to be developed, and had attempted to secure research assistants but the plaintiff rejected the candidates presented to him. Harvard later submitted sworn affidavits confirming that the mice were ordered in early November of 2016 and that the plaintiff refused to meet with the research assistant hired by Harvard, even though he had previously approved her. 6. In June of 2017, a different judge dismissed the plaintiff's first complaint for contempt. 7. Because I conclude that Harvard is entitled to a stay under Mass.R.App.P. 6(a), I need not address the plaintiff's argument that Harvard's alternative request for relief under G. L. c. 231, &#167; 118, is untimely. 8. Paragraph 1 of the July 7, 2017, order, which relates to the defendant, has been stayed by separate order in case no. 17 J 302.</td></tr>
