<td valign=top>ORDER: This case is scheduled for Oral argument on Monday, November 6, 2017. There is a jurisdictional issue that is not addressed by the parties in the briefs on file with this court that the panel must consider. Accordingly, at oral argument the parties are requested to address whether the appeal is properly before us based on the filing of the notice of appeal on September 13, 2016. The underlying ruling that is the subject of this appeal is an order July 6, 2016 denying the preliminary injunction. A motion to reconsider that request was filed on August 10, 2016 and denied on September 1, 2016. Under G.L. c. 231, &#167; 118, para. 2, the time in which to file a notice of appeal is thirty days. The tolling provision set forth in Mass. R. Civ. P. 4(a) is limited to appeals from judgments or order that constitute final judgments. See Ben v. Schultz, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 808 (1999); McGrath v. McGrath, 65 Mass. App. Ct. 670 (2006). See also Manouso v. Sarkis, 382 Mass. 317, 322 (1981). (Agnes, Maldonado & McDonough, JJ.). *Notice/Attest.</td></tr>

<td valign=top>ORDER: The plaintiffs, members of the People's Club of Nigeria-Boston Branch, USA, Inc. (PCNI-Boston), appeal from the denial of their motion for a preliminary injunction. The injunction was sought because the plaintiffs contend that an October 25, 2015, club election violated the club's by-laws and is invalid because (1) proxy votes were accepted and counted; (2) expelled members voted; and (3) a newly adopted October 11 voter eligibility rule permitted members "not in good financial standing" to vote. On appeal, the plaintiffs also contend the motion judge deprived them of procedural due process because they were denied the opportunity to call a particular witness or to cross-examine another witness over the course of three evidentiary hearings. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that the plaintiffs' appeal is untimely. Because the merits have been fully briefed, we nevertheless take this opportunity to address the plaintiffs' arguments and conclude the motion judge did not abuse his discretion or commit an error of law in denying the motion for a preliminary injunction. Background. PCNI-Boston is a nonprofit corporation headquartered in Boston and incorporated under G. L. c. 180. It is governed by a set of by-laws (by-laws or PCNI-Boston by-laws) that are the sole by-laws for purposes of G. L. c. 180, &#167; 6A. [3] On October 11, 2015, members of PCNI-Boston voted to abolish a rule giving voting rights to only those members who were current on their dues payments or who paid at least sixty percent of their owed dues. That same day, the members adopted a new rule that extended the right to vote to any member who owed more than $300, so long as that member paid at least $300. In his findings of fact, the motion judge stated the number of votes cast in adopting the new voter eligibility rule suggests there was a quorum. PCNI-Boston then conducted a general election for club officers according to the newly adopted voter eligibility rule on October 25, 2015. [4] On March 1, 2016, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction against the defendants, identified as present or past officers or members of the executive committee at PCNI-Boston. Since the defendants benefited from and oversaw the October 25 election, the plaintiffs sought to invalidate its results, as well as to obtain an order allowing them access to the PCNI-Boston clubhouse and allowing a caretaker committee to conduct a new election of officers. Following three evidentiary hearings, the motion for preliminary injunction was denied on July 6, 2016, and a motion for reconsideration that was filed on August 10, 2016, also was denied, on September 1, 2016. On September 13, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal challenging the denial of the preliminary injunction. Discussion. 1. Timeliness of appeal. General Laws c. 231, &#167; 118, second par., prescribes a thirty-day period for the appeal of interlocutory orders denying a preliminary injunction. Contrary to the plaintiffs' assertion, however, the tolling provisions contained in Mass.R.A.P. 4(a), as amended, 464 Mass. 1601 (2013), apply only to entries of judgment. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 52(b), as amended, 423 Mass. 1402 (1996); Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(e), 365 Mass. 827 (1974); Manousos v. Sarkis, 382 Mass. 317, 323 (1981). An order denying a preliminary injunction is not a judgment but is, instead, an interlocutory order. See G. L. c. 231, &#167; 118, second par. See also LeClair v. Norwell, 430 Mass. 328 (1999); Carabetta Enterprises, Inc. v. Schena, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 389 (1988). Consequently, the time within which the plaintiffs had to file a timely appeal was never tolled and expired on July 6, 2016, thirty days after the initial denial of the injunction. See Manousos, 382 Mass. at 322-323. Since the notice of appeal was entered in this court on September 13, 2016, well beyond that thirty-day time period, the appeal is untimely. 2. Merits of the plaintiffs' case. Notwithstanding the procedural flaw noted above, we will address the merits of the plaintiffs' arguments. A preliminary injunction is warranted only when the moving party establishes: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits of the claim, and (2) a substantial risk of irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction. Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609, 617 (1980). If these factors are established, the judge must then balance them against the harm an injunction will inflict on the nonmoving party, and must also consider the impact on the public interest. See, e.g., T & D Video, Inc. v. Revere, 423 Mass. 577, 580-581 (1996). Here, the motion judge denied the motion for a preliminary injunction because the plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits. We agree. At the outset, the plaintiffs incorrectly assert that the applicable standard of review in this case is de novo. It is well established that an interlocutory appeal challenging the denial of a preliminary injunction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Packaging Indus. Group, 380 Mass. at 615. If, as in this case, the motion judge did not limit the hearing to documentary evidence, but heard witnesses, the judge's "resolution of issues of credibility [must be followed], and [we must] consider the correctness of the order in light of the judge's assessment." Id. at 616. With that standard in mind, we assess the plaintiffs' argument. a. Proxy votes. General Laws c. 180, &#167; 6A, fourth par., inserted by St. 1989, c. 644, &#167; 4, allows proxy voting "[u]nless the corporation's articles of organization or by-laws otherwise provide . . . ." Here, the plaintiffs concede that PCNI-Boston's by-laws do not address proxy voting. Thus, the judge was correct in ruling that proxy voting was permitted at the October 25 election. See G. L. c. 180, &#167; 6A. The judge also correctly ruled that the proxy votes counted by PCNI-Boston cannot be challenged in this proceeding because the plaintiffs failed to show that the proxy votes were challenged before or at the time they were cast. See G. L. c. 180, &#167; 6A ("A proxy purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a member shall be deemed valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise and the burden of proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger"). b. Expelled members. The plaintiffs assert that several expelled members cast votes in the October 25 election, and those votes must be discounted. In support of their argument, the plaintiffs rely on eight affidavits from other members of PCNI-Boston in which these members stated that they witnessed expelled members cast votes. However, PCNI-Boston's by-laws do not define what it means for a member to be expelled; nor do they address the process by which a member is expelled [5]. For this reason, the affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs, which consisted exclusively of conclusory allegations, were not sufficient to raise a genuine question of doubt about whether those who voted in the election had been expelled. See Booth v. Silva, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 16, 20 (1994). At no time was there an offer of proof from the plaintiffs. The motion judge was therefore within his discretion in determining that the plaintiffs failed to show any likelihood of success with respect to their claim about expelled members being allowed to vote. c. Nonfinancial members. The plaintiffs argue that any vote cast by a member allowed to vote under the new financial obligations was invalid and therefore should not be counted. We disagree. "[T]he by-laws of a Massachusetts corporation . . . constitute a contract between the members and the [corporation]." Mitchell v. Albanian Orthodox Diocese in America, Inc., 355 Mass. 278, 282 (1969). Judicial relief is therefore appropriate only if there was a violation of that contract. See id. at 282-283. The record in the present case does not support the claim that a violation of that contract occurred. PCNI-Boston's by-laws, on the one hand, state: "[a]ll members" have equal rights to elect officers. On the other hand, the by-laws also provide: "[o]nly financial members" are eligible to vote. The by-laws do not contain a definition of a "financial member." In addition, the by-laws state: "All fees and dues are subject to change by the branch." In light of the general nature of the by-laws with respect to voter eligibility, as well as the latitude PCNI-Boston has to change the fee and dues structure, the motion judge was within his discretion when he concluded that the plaintiffs failed to show any likelihood of success as to their claim that the changes to voter eligibility were invalid. d. Due process. Generally, the scope of cross-examination is left to the discretion of the judge. See, e.g., Cooke v. Walter Kidde & Co., 8 Mass. App. Ct. 902, 903 (1979). See also Mass. G. Evid. &#167; 611(b)(1) (2017). Here, the plaintiffs were afforded three evidentiary hearings in support of their motion for preliminary injunction. On one occasion, the motion judge stated to the plaintiffs: "[Y]ou have not satisfied your burden . . . but I am giving you a further opportunity." The motion judge also informed the plaintiffs that they had produced "almost no relevant evidence." The plaintiffs made no offer of proof with respect to witnesses they sought to call or examine. We conclude the judge did not abuse his discretion in limiting the scope of the final evidentiary hearing, and thus there was no violation of the plaintiffs' rights to procedural due process. 3. Attorney's fees. The defendants request an award of appellate fees and costs. See Mass.R.A.P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 (1979). They argue the present appeal is one of several attempts by the plaintiffs over the past eleven years to hold "the club and its membership hostage" through frivolous appeals. An appeal is frivolous if, under settled law, the appellant has "no reasonable expectation of a reversal." Avery v. Steele, 414 Mass. 450, 455 (1993) (quotation omitted). The record here shows the plaintiffs have filed several complaints in the past and each was dismissed. In the wake of those unsuccessful claims, the plaintiffs continued to push forward in this case despite several explicit statements by the judge that they had failed to meet their evidentiary burden. In light of years of unsuccessful litigation, as well as three evidentiary hearings during which the plaintiffs failed to produce any material evidence in support of their arguments, we conclude that the defendants are entitled to an award of appellate attorney's fees [6]. See Mass.R.A.P. 25. Conclusion. For the reasons stated above, the appeal was untimely, and, in any event, there was no error or abuse of discretion in the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction.

Bernard Osuagwu, Valantine Igbobi, Clement Ukpong, Stanley Ibeabuchi, and Peter Uzoma. 3. The PCNI-Boston by-laws also expressly incorporate certain provisions from the PCNI National Constitution. 4. We note that the plaintiffs' initial complaint and documentation in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction states that the general election occurred on October 24, 2015. However, the motion judge and the plaintiffs' brief on appeal indicate the election occurred on October 25, 2015. 5. The PCNI National Constitution does contain provisions for the expulsion of members; however, because the PCNI-Boston by-laws do not expressly incorporate or even reference those provisions, we lack the authority to enforce the terms of the PCNI National Constitution. See G. L. c. 180, &#167; 6A. In addition, we note that Art. VI, &#167; 5(d) of the PCNI-Boston by-laws states a member will forfeit his dues "[d]uring . . . expulsion" but expulsion is not defined. 6. The defendants may submit a petition for fees and costs, together with supporting materials, within fourteen days of the date of the issuance of this memorandum and order. The plaintiffs shall have fourteen days thereafter to respond. See Fabre v. Walton, 441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004). 7. The panelists are listed in order of seniority.</td></tr>
