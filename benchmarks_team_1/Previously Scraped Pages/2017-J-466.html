<td nowrap valign=top>&nbsp;</td>
<td valign=top>ORDER: Following the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Commonwealth v. Resende, 474 Mass. 455 (2016), a judge of the trial court denied the defendant's motion for release from confinement (Motion for Release), concluding that the defendant had in fact committed three legally separate and sequential prosecutions and therefore was appropriately convicted as being a level three armed career criminal, see G.L. c. 269, 10G(c). The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. The defendant subsequently filed a Motion to Admit Him to Bail Pending Decision on Appeal (Motion for Stay), which necessarily included a motion for stay of execution of sentence. In his memorandum in support of that motion, the defendant noted, inter alia, this Court's recent decision in Commonwealth v. Widener, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 696 (2017). The standard for allowing a motion for stay of execution is well known. See Commonwealth v. Hodge, 380 Mass. 851 (1980). In order to prevail, the defendant must demonstrate his appeal presents "'an issue which is worthy of presentation to an appellate court, one which offers some reasonable possibility of a successful decision in the appeal.'" Id. at 855. In addition, the motion judge must evaluate considerations "relating to security, such as the possibility of flight to avoid punishment; potential danger to any other person or to the community; and the likelihood of further criminal acts during the pendency of the appeal. " Id. The judge who denied the defendant's Motion for Release also heard the Motion for Stay. The judge held a hearing on the matter yesterday the Commonwealth does not tell me whether it was an evidentiary hearing or not and he allowed the Motion for Stay. The Commonwealth has sought review of that motion under M.R.A.P. 6(b). The question of whether to stay execution of a sentence pending appeal is one deliberately left in the first instance to the discretion of the trial court judge. See Commonwealth v. Hodge, 380 Mass. 851, 853 (1980). I must defer to that decision and may reverse it only if the appealing party can demonstrate an abuse of discretion. As I say, I do not have the benefit of a transcript of the judge's hearing held yesterday, nor did the judge offer any written reasons for his order. The judge has taken the unusual step of concluding that the defendant has demonstrated sufficient likelihood of success on appeal to warrant a stay of execution of sentence, despite his own order denying relief. While I will must defer to the judge's reasonable conclusion about probability of success, I do note that our recent Widener decision did nothing to alter the standard articulated in Resende, nor does it have any direct implications for the complicated sequence of sentencing events the defendant claims entitle him to relief, or for the question whether, in these circumstances, straight probation amounts to a "sentence" within the meaning of Resende. While the judge was not required to give written reasons for his decision, in order to facilitate appellate review, I will order that he make such findings . As to the security considerations, on which the Commonwealth principally relies, as the Supreme Judicial Court has noted they "involve determination of fact" as well as "the exercise of sound, practical judgment, and common sense." Hodge at 855. Because a single justice ordinarily has no ability to examine the facts relevant to these considerations, his or her deference with respect to these questions is necessarily strong. See id. Nonetheless, the single justice may be asked to reverse a trial court judge's determination with respect to these security considerations if it amounts to "an abuse of discretion." See Id. at 853. Consequently, in order to facilitate appellate review, I will also ask that the motion judge provide written findings explaining his conclusion with respect to these security considerations. The judge's findings shall be filed by 2:00 p.m. on October 20, 2017. Any opposition to the Commonwealth's motion should be submitted on or before that same time.

<td valign=top>ORDER: I am now in receipt of the thorough and detailed findings of the motion judge (Billings, J.) issued in response to my order of October 18, 2017. As to the question whether the appeal presents "an issue which is worthy of presentation to an appellate court, one which offers some reasonable possibility of a successful decision in the appeal," Commonwealth v. Hodge, 380 Mass. 851, 855 (1980), the judge's thoughtful analysis reveals no error of law or other abuse of discretion. As to the issues "relating to security, such as the possibility of flight to avoid punishment; potential danger to any other person or to the community; and the likelihood of further criminal acts during the pendency of the appeal," the judge's findings demonstrate clearly that he considered those issues and he states explicitly "I concluded that although the defendant does pose some risk of further offenses (though not enough, for example, to hold him under G.L. c. 276, &#167; 58A [regarding pretrial detention on grounds of dangerousness]) and/or risk of flight, the risks could be reasonably mitigated with terms of probation including a GPS bracelet and a condition that he be gainfully employed." This is precisely the type of discretionary determination that is committed to the judge of the trial court. Because in these circumstances such judges are better situated to make them, the Supreme Judicial Court has held that the single justice may not second guess them: "[T]he single justice act[s] properly in declining to substitute his discretion for that of the trial judge." Hodge at 855. Consequently, the petition as filed must be denied. I note that the Commonwealth has sought to bring before the single justice by way of a "Supplement" some additional, troubling evidence that was not presented to the motion judge before he allowed the defendant's motion to admit him to bail, specifically affidavits in support of restraining orders filed against the defendant. Before I can consider it, this evidence must be considered by the motion judge in the first instance. See M.R.A.P. 6. The Commonwealth asserts that it has, indeed, now also placed this evidence before the motion judge, subsequent to my previous order, in a motion for reconsideration. The judge apparently has not yet ruled on that motion, but I trust he will do so promptly. He is authorized to do so, and to hold an evidentiary hearing should he consider it appropriate. At this time, any filing seeking my consideration of that evidence is premature. Treating the Supplement as a Motion for Stay, it therefore must be denied without prejudice to refiling consistent with the requirements of M.R.A.P. 6. The motion seeking impoundment of the exhibit is allowed. (Rubin, J). *Notice/Attest/Billing, J.</td></tr>
