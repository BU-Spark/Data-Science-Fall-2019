<td valign=top>MEMORANDUM AND ORDER: In this action under G. L. c. 258E, the plaintiff, then a Harvard PhD student, sought and obtained a harassment prevention order against the defendant, a Harvard faculty member. The defendant appealed the judge's original decision and order, as well as subsequent modifications of that order. Before me now is the defendant's emergency motion to vacate or stay pending appeal the judge's most recent order, dated July 7, 2017. For the reasons that follow, the motion for a stay pending appeal under Mass.R.App.P. 6(a)(1) is allowed. Background. Only an abbreviated version of the procedural history, which is lengthy and convoluted, is necessary for my resolution of the motion. In August of 2016, after a hearing, the judge found that the defendant had committed "harassment" against the plaintiff as defined in G. L. c. 258E[1]. The judge ordered (1) that the defendant "stay at least 100 feet away from the plaintiff and have no contact, direct or indirect, with plaintiff" and (2) that the "[p]laintiff is to immediately be fully restored to his position and research in the [defendant's] [l]ab with all the assistance, equipment, and supplies he had on March 10, 2016." The stay-away order created practical difficulties because it effectively banished the defendant from his own lab, which he is required by federal law to oversee. A series of hearings ensued, with Harvard participating as amicus curiae. On October 4, 2016, the judge entered a supplemental order, which provided for the plaintiff's transfer to a different lab. The judge ordered the defendant to release to Harvard "whatever funds are necessary to provide plaintiff with the same resources he had on March 10, 2016, i.e., two research assistants he had been approved for, and the S.M.A. mice (2 models KO and SMND7), necessary for his research."[2] For various reasons, however, the plan to move the plaintiff to a different lab was unsuccessful. Harvard then proposed that the plaintiff remain in the defendant's lab, subject to formal oversight by the defendant, but with a different thesis advisor. On October 17 the judge entered an order to that effect, stating that the plaintiff "shall remain in the [defendant's] [l]ab, supervised by the [defendant]." The order allowed the defendant to have access to the lab for three hours each weekday morning and complete access to his office and an adjacent classroom. It also reiterated the requirements that the plaintiff be provided with research assistants and the mice necessary for his research. On November 30 the parties appeared for another hearing, after the plaintiff moved to modify the October 17 order and to hold the defendant in contempt. The majority of the hearing concerned the issue that the plaintiff did not yet have the research assistants or the mice.[3] For that reason, on December 14, the judge entered a revised order reimposing the 100-foot stay-away requirement. On motion of the defendant, however, a single justice of this court vacated the stay-away requirement on January 30, 2017, and reinstated the provision allowing the defendant to have access to the lab in the mornings. Meanwhile, Harvard had assigned another faculty member, Dr. Sheila Thomas, to be the plaintiff's thesis advisor. In late December of 2016, the plaintiff sent Dr. Thomas an email stating, "For your harassing conduct towards me, I hereby notify you that you are no longer my interim thesis advisor." In January of 2017, when the plaintiff's program head told him that he needed a thesis advisor, the plaintiff began insisting that the judge's order required the defendant to be his advisor. Over the ensuing months, the plaintiff refused numerous requests from Harvard faculty and administrators, including his dissertation advisory committee (DAC), to meet to discuss the progress of his research. In several of his email responses, the plaintiff asserted that the Superior Court now controlled the terms and conditions of his academic progress at Harvard. As a result, and after notice and an opportunity to be heard (which the plaintiff declined), the Administrative Board of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences voted to place the plaintiff on academic probation with conditions. The plaintiff refused to comply with those conditions, even though he was warned that failure to comply would result in his withdrawal. On May 16, 2017, after the plaintiff failed to appear for another DAC meeting despite reminders, he was officially withdrawn as a graduate student. The next day, Harvard filed with the court an emergency motion to intervene for the limited purpose of seeking a modification of the December 14, 2016, order, and an emergency motion to modify the order based on the changed circumstance that the plaintiff was no longer a student at Harvard and could not have access to the lab. At the hearing on the motions, the plaintiff insisted again that the defendant must be his thesis advisor and that, absent such an arrangement, he would not attend any meetings.[5] On July 7, after a hearing on several pending matters, including an order for the defendant and Harvard to show cause why they should not be held in contempt,[6] the judge entered a revised order. As relevant here, the revised order (1) reinstates the 100-foot stay-away provision vacated by the single justice; (2) requires the defendant to "continue to serve as [the plaintiff's] supervisor, including being his thesis advisor . . . unless and until a new . . . thesis advisor is identified who is acceptable to" the plaintiff"; (3) requires "[p]hysical meetings between [the defendant] and [the plaintiff] . . ., provided they are in the presence of a third party"; (4) requires the defendant and the plaintiff "to meet . . . to discuss [the plaintiff's] research at least once every twelve weeks, until [the plaintiff] completes his research or [the defendant] is replaced as [the plaintiff's] supervisor, including his role as thesis advisor"; and (5) requires that the plaintiff "be invited to, and [the defendant] physically attend, 'periodic general lab meetings,' . . . as they did prior to March 10, 2016 and with the same frequency." Discussion. To obtain a stay pending appeal, the appellant must show "(1) the likelihood of appellant's success on the merits; (2) the likelihood of irreparable harm to appellant if the court denies the stay; (3) the absence of substantial harm to other parties if the stay issues; and (4) the absence of harm to the public interest." C.E. v. J.E., 472 Mass. 1016, 1017 (2015). In evaluating the respective harms, the court must "look not to the degree of injury alone, but rather to the risk of harm in view of the [moving] party's chance of success on the merits." Packaging Industries Group, Inc. v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609, 622 (1980). "It is the combination of likelihood of success and degree of irreparable injury that matters." Ibid. 1. Likelihood of success. I conclude, for two reasons, that the defendant is highly likely to succeed on the merits of his appeal of the judge's July 7, 2017, order.[7] First, the defendant will likely prevail on his argument that the judge exceeded the scope of her authority under G. L. c. 258E by ordering him to serve as the plaintiff's thesis advisor, meet with the plaintiff regularly, and conduct and attend general lab meetings with the plaintiff present. Under G. L. c. 258E, &#167; 3(a), "[a] person suffering from harassment may file a complaint in the appropriate court requesting protection from such harassment." In particular, "[a] person may petition the court under this chapter for an order that the defendant: (i) refrain from abusing or harassing the plaintiff, whether the defendant is an adult or minor; (ii) refrain from contacting the plaintiff, unless authorized by the court, whether the defendant is an adult or minor; (iii) remain away from the plaintiff's household or workplace, whether the defendant is an adult or minor; and (iv) pay the plaintiff monetary compensation for the losses suffered as a direct result of the harassment; provided, however, that compensatory damages shall include, but shall not be limited to, loss of earnings, out-of-pocket losses for injuries sustained or property damaged, cost of replacement of locks, medical expenses, cost for obtaining an unlisted phone number and reasonable attorney's fees." G. L. c. 258E, &#167; 3(a). Chapter 258E "was intended to protect victims who could not legally seek protection under [chapter] 209A." Seney v. Morhy, 467 Mass. 58, 60 (2014). Like chapter 258E, chapter 209A identifies four forms of relief that a judge may issue to protect a person suffering from abuse. See G. L. c. 209A, &#167; 3. Unlike chapter 258E, however, chapter 209A provides that a judge can issue orders "including, but not limited to" the four specified categories. Ibid. The "including, but not limited to" language was omitted prior to enactment of chapter 258E, strongly suggesting that the relief available under that statute is confined to the listed remedies. See Fernandes v. Attleboro Housing Auth., 470 Mass. 117, 128-130 (2014). The orders at issue here go far beyond those remedies and plainly exceeded the scope of the judge's statutory authority. Nor were the orders authorized by the general equity powers of the Superior Court. "It is a maxim that equity follows the law as declared by a statute." T.F. v. B.L., 442 Mass. 522, 533 (2004), quoting from Rossi Bros. v. Commissioner of Banks, 283 Mass. 114, 119 (1933). "Equity is not an all-purpose judicial tool by which the 'right thing to do' can be fashioned into a legal obligation possessing the legitimacy of legislative enactment." Id. at 533-534, quoting from Freeman v. Chaplic, 388 Mass. 398, 406 n.15 (1983). See McCarthy v. Governor, 471 Mass. 1008, 1011 (2015) ("court's equitable powers may not be used to provide relief that is contrary to statutory or constitutional requirements"). Even were I to assume, despite the plain language of chapter 258E, that the judge had some equitable authority to go beyond the statutory remedies, the injunctions she entered have no reasonable relation to the purpose of the statute. See O'Brien v. Borowski, 461 Mass. 415, 419-420 (2012). In fact, the orders requiring the defendant to have contact with the plaintiff directly contravene the statutory purpose.[8] Thus, whatever the permissible bounds of a court's equitable authority in chapter 258E proceedings, the orders here far exceeded them. Second, the defendant is likely to prevail on his argument that the judge abused her discretion by reinstating the 100-foot stay-away provision. A single justice of this court vacated that provision in January of 2017, and the record reveals no changed circumstances that would justify the judge's contravening order. Based on the course of the proceedings, I agree with the defendant that the stay-away order serves no purpose other than a punitive one. 2. Balancing of harms. The defendant has demonstrated that he will suffer irreparable harm if I do not issue a stay. The defendant asserts that his relationship with the plaintiff is irretrievably broken, and I can reach no other conclusion based on my review of the record. The defendant would therefore be irreparably harmed if he is forced to serve as the plaintiff's thesis advisor and to attend regular meetings with the plaintiff while his appeal is pending. See Schaer v. Brandeis University, 432 Mass. 474, 482 (2000) (quotation omitted) (courts must be "chary about interfering with academic and disciplinary decisions made by private colleges and universities"). At the same time, the stay-away requirement would banish the defendant from his own lab for no valid purpose. Conversely, the plaintiff will not suffer irreparable harm if the order is stayed. Despite the plaintiff's insistence that the defendant must be his thesis advisor, the judge had no authority to order such relief, which, as mentioned, is directly contrary to the purposes of chapter 258E. The balancing of harms thus weighs heavily in favor of entering the stay, especially given the strength of the defendant's arguments on the merits. See Packaging Industries Group, 380 Mass. at 622. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, paragraph 1 of the July 7, 2017, order is stayed pending resolution of the defendant's appeal.[9] The January 30, 2017, order of the single justice shall remain in effect without prejudice to the defendant's requesting modification in the trial court based on changed circumstances since the order was entered.[10] (Shin, J.). *Notice/Attest/Fahey, J. Footnotes 1. The merits of the defendant's appeal from the underlying decision are not before me. 2. In addition, the order, as well as all of the judge's subsequent orders, "precluded [the defendant] from using in any fashion any of plaintiff's research, including but not limited to publications, not even in an abstract." 3. At this hearing the judge barred Harvard's counsel from participating unless Harvard filed a motion to intervene. The defendant's counsel conveyed to the judge his understanding that Harvard had ordered the mice, which were specific strains that had to be developed, and had attempted to secure research assistants but the plaintiff rejected the candidates presented to him. Harvard later submitted sworn affidavits confirming that the mice were ordered in early November of 2016 and that the plaintiff refused to meet with the research assistant hired by Harvard, even though he had previously approved her. 4. The defendant filed a second supplemental notice of appeal on December 30, 2016. 5. After the hearings the judge allowed Harvard's motion for limited intervention but denied the requested modification. The judge also allowed the plaintiff's "oral motion to add Harvard" and ordered Harvard "to comply with . . . [the December 14 order] pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P.71." 6. In June of 2017, a different judge dismissed the plaintiff's first complaint for contempt. 7. The defendant filed a notice of appeal of the July 7 order on July 10, 2017. The Superior Court assembled the record in the defendant's first two appeals in April of 2017. 8. Indeed, at a hearing in October of 2016 -- before the plaintiff sent the email to Dr. Thomas trying to unilaterally terminate her as his thesis advisor -- he informed the judge that he "cannot accept to have [the defendant] as his supervisor" because the defendant "has already harassed [him] endlessly." And at the hearings in May of 2017, the judge twice stated that, while she did not appreciate earlier that there was a difference between a thesis advisor and a supervisor, she would "not have permitted" the defendant to be the plaintiff's thesis advisor. 9. Paragraphs 2 and 3, which relate to Harvard, have been stayed by separate order in case no. 17 J 293. 10. The single justice's order replaced paragraph 1 of the judge's December 14, 2016, order but otherwise left the December 14 order intact. Paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the December 14 order have been stayed, however, per my order in case no. 17 J 293.</td></tr>
