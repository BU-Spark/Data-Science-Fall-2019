Ct., No. 20070770 (June 26, 2017) (memorandum and order on postconviction motions), and given the conduct of the District Attorneys that the petitioners allege was improper. 2. Whether the definition of "Farak defendants" being employed by the District Attorneys in this case is too narrow; specifically, based on the material in the record of this case, whether the appropriate definition of the class should be expanded to include all defendant's who pleaded guilty to a drug charge, admitted to sufficient facts on a drug charge, or were found guilty of a drug charge, if the alleged drugs were tested at the Amherst Laboratory during Farak's employment there, regardless whether Farak was the analyst or signed the certificates in their cases. 3.

The parties have conferred, and counsel for petitioners have reached an agreement with counsel for the District Attorney for Middlesex County concerning two proposed orders. Accordingly, enclosed for filing please find (1) Petitioner's Proposed Order on Interim and Final Case Lists, and (2) Petitioners Proposed Superseding Order on Impoundment.

<td valign=top>FIRST INTERIM ORDER: " The District Attorneys have agreed to vacate certain convictions obtained using drug certificates signed by Sonja Farak, and to dismiss those charges with prejudice. The parties currently are engaged in developing and implementing a protocol, similar to the protocol prescribed by this court in Bridgeman v. District Attorney for the Suffolk Dist., 476 Mass. 298 (2017) (Bridgeman II), to accomplish that result. For these purposes, the District Attorneys define Farak defendants as defendants who pleaded guilty (or delinquent or youthful offender) to a drug charge, admitted to sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty (or delinquent or youthful offender) on a drug charge, or were found guilty (or delinquent or youthful offender) of a drug charge in any case in which Farak signed a drug certificate as an analyst between August, 2004 and January, 2013, while she was employed at the Department of Public Health's laboratory in Amherst, except for the so-called Ruffin defendants. See Commonwealth v. Ruffin, 475 Mass. 1003 (2016). To facilitate this protocol, and upon consideration of the protocol used in Bridgeman, it is ORDERED that: 1. Preparation of Formatted Interim Lists of and Dismissal of Agreed-Upon Convictions. By March 30, 2018, the respondents shall have filed with the Court and served on the petitioners their formatted interim lists, in digital format such as CD-Rs, identifying the convictions, delinquency or youthful offender adjudications, or other adverse dispositions of Farak defendants that the respondents agree should be vacated and dismissed with prejudice. For each such conviction, the respondents shall include the relevant defendant's name, date of birth, Social Security number, relevant Trial Court or Juvenile Court docket number, Case ID number, the count(s) to be dismissed, and PCF number. To ease the burdens on court personnel who will be tasked with effecting the dismissal of these convictions, and to ease the burdens on the parties, the Court directs the respondents to format their respective interim lists uniformly, following the template provided by the Trial Court's information technology department. Upon receipt of these formatted interim lists, the Court will enter a declaratory judgment vacating the listed convictions, delinquency or youthful offender adjudications or other adverse dispositions, dismissing the underlying charges with prejudice. 2. Preparation of Formatted Final Lists . By April 30, 2018, the respondents shall have filed with the Court and served on the petitioners their final lists, again in the uniform format provided by the Trial Court's information technology department, identifying: (a) the convictions of Farak defendants that the respondents agree should be vacated and dismissed with prejudice in the format used by the District Attorney for Norfolk County; (b) the convictions of Farak defendants that the respondents do not agree should be vacated and dismissed with prejudice; and (c) a list of any Ruffin defendants whose convictions the respondents do not agree should be vacated and dismissed with prejudice. As to the final lists, the Court directs the respondents to identify cases for inclusion in their formatted final lists using the agreed-upon framework from the Bridgeman litigation. See Bridgeman v. District Attorney for Suffolk County, Interim Order (May 11, 2016). The respondents shall not rely solely on DPH data to identify cases to include in their formatted final lists. Rather, the respondents shall use search methods sufficient to ascertain, for each adverse disposition listed in MassCourts' 94C data for the relevant time period, whether Farak signed the relevant certificate of analysis. 3. Working Group. After submission of the formatted interim lists, the Court will schedule a meeting of the Working Group, to meet in Courtroom Two of the John Adams Courthouse. At least three days in advance of the meeting, the Working Group shall submit to the Court a joint proposed agenda for the meeting." (Gaziano, J.)</td></tr>

<td valign=top>FURTHER ORDER OF IMPOUNDMENT: " Pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 1:15, it is ORDERED that: a. All case lists filed by the respondents, and any database(s) or documents generated from such lists that contain information about identifiable individuals, are IMPOUNDED and may be accessed and viewed only by counsel for the parties, including their staff and agents, the Supreme Judicial Court, the Superior Court, the District Court, the Boston Municipal Court, the Juvenile Court, and the Office of the Commissioner of Probation. b. All case lists designating convictions to be dismissed, and any database(s) or documents generated from such lists that contain information about identifiable individuals, are IMPOUNDED and may be accessed and viewed only by counsel for the parties, including their staff and agents as needed, the Supreme Judicial Court, the Superior Court, the District Court, the Boston Municipal Court, the Juvenile Court, the Office of the Commissioner of Probation, the United States Federal Public Defender Office for the Districts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, and the United States Probation Offices for the Districts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. c. Bar advocates who believe they may have represented Farak defendants in cases initiated between August 2004 and January 2013, and post-conviction panel attorneys presently representing possible Farak defendants, may access and view the lists and/or related database(s) only via the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) E-bill system and only if they have signed and submitted to CPCS the designated Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) non-disclosure form, for the limited purposes of: (a) identifying cases in which their present or former clients are listed as Farak defendants and (b) ascertaining how the respondent District Attorneys intend to treat those cases. d. Notwithstanding the impoundment of case lists and related databases and data in this matter, including caseparty data provided by the Trial Court's MassCourts system, the impoundment orders in this matter shall not preclude the disclosure of certain information from said lists and related databases which does not reveal identifying information about any individual. This non-identifying information includes: charges, courts, counties, and dispositions, as well as aggregate data drawn from the respondents' case lists or MassCourts system data. Should any party file with the county clerk redacted versions of case lists, data, or related database(s) that are void of any Farak defendant individual identifying information, including but not limited to names, birth dates, social security numbers, or case docket numbers, the redacted lists, data, or database(s) shall not be subject to this impoundment order and shall be accessible to the public."
