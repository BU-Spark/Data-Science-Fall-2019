See Commonwealth v. Walczak, 463 Mass. 808 (2012). See also id. at 836 (Gants, J., concurring). 2. Whether, if the court were to adopt such a rule, it should be applied prospectively only. 3.

<td valign=top>ORDER: In Commonwealth v. Grassie, 476 Mass. 202 (2017), we rejected the defendant's claims that the evidence was insufficient to warrant his conviction of murder in the second degree, that the prosecutor's closing argument was improper and warranted a new trial, and that the indictment should be dismissed because the grand jury were not given legal instructions on mitigating circumstances and self-defense. We left open his claim that the trial judge erred or abused his discretion in denying his postverdict motion to reduce the degree of the verdict to manslaughter, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2). We transferred the case to the county court in order for the trial judge, who is now a Justice of this court, to review that motion anew and to provide a statement explaining the reasons for his decision. Id. at 216-217. He has since done so and has reported the matter back to the full court, along with a memorandum of decision on the issue. The parties may provide supplemental memoranda, not to exceed ten double-spaced pages, addressing the Rule 25 (b) (2) issue in light of the judge's recent memorandum of decision. The defendant's supplemental memorandum is due on or before September 25, 2017; the Commonwealth's memorandum will be due thirty days later. No extensions of time should be anticipated. These supplemental submissions will be considered by the court together with the parties' original arguments on the Rule 25 (b) (2) issue from their briefs. The case will be heard at the November, 2017 sitting. Each side will have ten minutes to argue, limited to the Rule 25 (b) (2) issue. By the Court.</td></tr>

<td valign=top>ORDER: In Commonwealth v. Grassie, 476 Mass. 202 (2017), the full court transferred this matter to the county court, to give the trial judge, sitting as a single justice, an opportunity to provide an explanation of his reasons for denying the defendant's motion to reduce the verdict pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), in order to facilitate the full court's review of his ruling. The judge has since provided a detailed explanation of his reasoning. We have reviewed his memorandum of decision. The judge indicated in his memorandum that, for purposes of his review under rule 25 (b) (2), he considered the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See memorandum at 2 ( I consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth ), citing Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979); memorandum at 10 ( I find that there are two reasons why the evidence, considered in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, does not compel this extraordinary relief ). One question we will consider is whether the Latimore approach of viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth was a correct and sufficient approach when determining whether to reduce a verdict to a lesser degree of guilt under rule 25 (b) (2). See Commonwealth v. Chhim, 447 Mass. 370, 380-384 (2006); Commonwealth v. Keough, 385 Mass. 314, 318-321 (1982). See also Commonwealth v. Rolon, 438 Mass. 808, 820 (2003), citing Commonwealth v. Gaulden, 383 Mass. 543, 553-556 (1981) (comparing trial judge's power to reduce verdicts under rule 25 [b] [2] to the full court's power to reduce verdicts pursuant to G. L. c. 278, &#167; 33E; stating that trial judge's decision on motion should be guided by same considerations). The defendant has already filed a supplemental memorandum pursuant to our order dated August 25, 2017, but has not addressed this question. He may, within five business days of today's order, file a second supplemental memorandum, not to exceed five double-spaced pages, addressing the question. The Commonwealth has not yet filed its supplemental memorandum, which is due under the terms of our previous order on October 20, 2017. It should be sure to state its position on this question in its supplemental memorandum. By the Court (Gaziano, J., recused).</td></tr>

<td nowrap valign=top>#27</td>
<td valign=top>ORDER: The sole remaining legal issue before this court on the defendant's direct appeal is whether the trial judge erred or abused his discretion in denying the defendant's motion to reduce the verdict pursuant to the last sentence of Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (b) (2), as amended, 420 Mass. 1502 (1995). In Commonwealth v. Grassie, 476 Mass. 202 (2017), we transferred this matter to the county court to give the judge, sitting as a single justice, an opportunity to provide an explanation of his reasons for denying the motion in order to facilitate our review of his ruling. The judge provided a detailed explanation of his reasoning. We then invited the parties to submit supplemental memoranda addressing the judge's ruling, and subsequently asked the parties to address whether the judge applied a correct and sufficient legal standard in evaluating the facts of the case for purposes of deciding whether to reduce the verdict. When presented with a motion to reduce a verdict, a judge is not constrained to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The motion calls for a broader view of the evidence. See Commonwealth v. Chhim, 447 Mass. 370, 382-383 (2006) ( The judge was not limited . . . to viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, . . . but instead was correct to consider the over-all weight of the evidence ), citing Commonwealth v. Keough, 385 Mass. 314, 318-319 (1982) (rejecting Commonwealth's argument that judge had no authority to give weight to the defendant's version of the events in the face of evidence that warranted contrary findings ) . Although a judge must tread lightly and exercise the power sparingly, he or she must look at all the evidence and need not draw the same conclusions from the evidence as did the jury. Commonwealth v. Woodward, 427 Mass. 659, 689-690 (1998). See Commonwealth v. Rolon, 438 Mass. 808, 820-822 (2003); Commonwealth v. Gaulden, 383 Mass. 543, 552-555 (1981) (rejecting Commonwealth's argument that judge may not properly weigh the evidence and conclude, that a guilty finding of a lesser offense is more appropriate," and concluding that rule authorizes judge to reduce verdict without regard to the fact that the evidence warranted the jury's verdict of guilty of the greater offense ). The objective on a rule 25 (b) (2) motion is to determine whether, in the judge's discretion, based on his or her consideration of all the evidence, a reduction of the verdict to a lesser degree of guilt would comport[] more closely with the weight of the evidence, and thus [would be] more consonant with justice, Commonwealth v. Keough, supra at 320, and to ensure that the result in every criminal case is consonant with justice. Commonwealth v. Rolon, supra at 820, quoting Commonwealth v. Woodward, supra at 666. See Commonwealth v. Gaulden, supra at 556 ( A most important consideration is whether the jury verdict is markedly inconsistent with the verdicts returned in similar cases. In such circumstances, rule 25 [b] [2] offers a means of rectifying disproportionate verdicts where previously trial judges had only the option of granting a new trial to cure the inequity ). The task for a trial judge is comparable to the task undertaken by this court when it reviews a conviction of murder in the first degree pursuant to G. L. c. 278, &#167; 33E, and a trial judge's decision on a rule 25 (b) (2) motion should be guided by the same considerations.' Commonwealth v. Rolon, supra at 820, quoting Commonwealth v. Gaulden, supra at 555. When conducting &#167; 33E review, we are not limited to reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. To be sure, a judge acting on such a motion, particularly a trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses, is free to discredit the defendant's evidence and his version of the events in whole or in part, and to give them little or no weight accordingly. He is also free to acknowledge the strength of the defendant's evidence but conclude that it did not necessarily outweigh the strength of the Commonwealth's case. But the judge may not confine his view of the evidence to the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. The judge here made reference in his decision to two different legal standards. Citing Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), he stated that, when acting on the motion, he considered the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See memorandum at 2 ( Since the issue is whether the defendant's motion to reduce the verdict was wrongly decided, I consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth ); id. at 10 ( I find that there are two reasons why the evidence, considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, does not compel this extraordinary result ); id. at 13 (distinguishing cases cited by the full court in its opinion on the ground that here, [t]he evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, does not support a claim that the defendant was confused and frightened' ). Elsewhere in his memorandum, however, the judge used language suggesting that his view of the evidence may not have been confined to the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. For example, he quoted the correct legal standard from Commonwealth v. Rolon, 438 Mass. at 821 , which states that [a] judge's discretion to reduce a verdict pursuant to rule 25 (b) (2) is appropriately exercised where the weight of the evidence in the case, although technically sufficient to support the jury's verdict, points to a lesser crime. And in the final sentence of the memorandum, the judge stated that the verdict was not so far against the weight of the evidence as to constitute a miscarriage of justice. Because the judge referred to two standards, one proper and one improper, and because we cannot be certain which standard the judge applied in denying the defendant's rule 25 (b) (2) motion to reduce the verdict of murder in the second degree, we conclude that the most prudent course of action is to remand the matter to the single justice for reconsideration so that our review of his decision is not burdened by this ambiguity. We therefore ORDER remand to the county court of the defendant's motion so that we may obtain the necessary clarity on this point. By the Court</td></tr>
