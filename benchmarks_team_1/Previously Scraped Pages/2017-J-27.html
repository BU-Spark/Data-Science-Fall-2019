<td valign=top>ORDER: This is a petition for review to the single justice pursuant to G. L. c. 231, &#167; 118 par. 1, of an order of a judge of the Superior Court compelling arbitration. Samuel Hanmer, a member of Springfield Capital, LLC, has sued Joseph Cambi, Springfield Capital Corporation (SCC), and the LLC seeking to recoup investment losses. Cambi, SCC, and the LLC have asserted that the LLC's operating agreement, to which the parties are bound as members, requires arbitration of this matter, or in the alternative, Cambi and the LLC are entitled to compel arbitration even if they are not members of the LLC.[2] Background. Pursuant to the Massachusetts Arbitration Act (MAA), G. L. c. 251, if there is a "substantial and bona fide dispute" as to the existence of an agreement to arbitrate, the issue "shall be forthwith and summarily determined" by the Superior Court. G. L. c. 251, &#167; 2(b), inserted by St. 1960, c. 374, &#167; 1. See Johnson v. Kindred Healthcare, Inc., 466 Mass. 779, 781-782 (2014); Walker v. Collyer, 85 Mass. App. Ct. 311, 318 (2014).[3] A motion to compel arbitration is reviewed under a summary judgment standard, Miller v. Cotter, 448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007), and an appellate court reviews interlocutory orders compelling arbitration de novo, with facts construed in light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Constantino v. Frechette, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 352, 354 (2008). "If there is a dispute as to a material fact, 'the judge conducts an expedited evidentiary hearing'; where . . . 'there is not such a dispute, the judge resolves the issue as a matter of law.'" Johnson, 466 Mass. at 781-782, quoting McInnes v. LPL Fin., LLC, 466 Mass. 256, 261, (2013). The Operating Agreement of the LLC contains an arbitration clause which provides in pertinent part: "13.8 13.9 Dispute Resolution. If at any time during the existence of the Company, any question, disagreement, difference, or controversy (a "Dispute") shall rise between the Members concerning the Company, or its affairs, transactions, business or accounts, or the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement, or the rights, duties, or obligations of its Members, then (a) the Members shall agree to negotiate in good faith to attempt to resolve the Dispute for thirty (30) days, and (b) if the Dispute cannon be resolved during such thirty (30) day period, any Member may cause such Dispute to be submitted to and determined by arbitration." (emphasis added). The introductory paragraph of the Operating Agreement contains the following provision: This Operating Agreement (the "Agreement") of Springfield Capital, LLC (the "Company") dated as of April 8, 2008 (the "Effective Date") is made by and among Springfield Capital Corporation, a Massachusetts Corporation of which Joseph A. Cambi is the sole shareholder ("SCC/Cambi") and each other Person subsequently admitted as a Member pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (collectively the "Members"). (emphasis added). The Operating Agreement then identifies "SCC/Cambi" as the original "Member" (a capitalized term in the Agreement) of the Company. However, the only entity to sign the Operating Agreement was SCC, by its President, Joseph Cambi, and the only entity listed on the schedule of Members, as provided in the record, is SCC. A judge of the Superior Court concluded that the reference to "SCC/Cambi" in the introductory paragraph of the Operating Agreement was sufficient to designate Cambi as a Member of the LCC. An order entered compelling arbitration as to the SCC, the LLC, and Cambi. Discussion. It is beyond dispute that SCC is a Member of the LLC, is bound to its arbitration provision, and may enforce that provision against other Members.[1] The real issue in this petition for single justice relief is whether the LLC and Cambi are Members, and therefore parties to the Operating Agreement, or whether they may otherwise enforce its arbitration provision against Hanmer. The LLC is not a Member within the meaning of the Agreement as a matter of law. The word "Member" is not a defined term in the Agreement, but at several points in the Agreement "Members" are identified, and the LLC (quite predictably) is not listed anywhere as a Member. The plain language of the contract does not include the LLC as a Member. See Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 477 (1989) (though subject to FAA, state law principles of contract interpretation apply to interpretation of arbitration provisions); Hoefs v. CACV of Colorado, LLC, 365 F.Supp.2d 69, 74 (D. Mass. 2005) (applying plain language rule in interpreting arbitration clause). The LLC is not a member of itself, either as a matter of contract, or as a matter of statute, to which the Operating Agreement expressly refers. See G. L. c. 156C, &#167;&#167; 2, 9, 20 (setting forth procedures for designating a member of an LLC and maintaining records of members). Turning to Cambi, the judge concluded as a matter of law that Cambi was a Member (as set forth in the Agreement) because he was referenced in the introductory paragraph and was included in the parenthetical describing the Original Member, i.e., "SCC/Cambi." However, Cambi, individually, does not appear on the signature page, and he is not listed separately on the schedule of members. By statute, the records of the LLC must contain a list of all members. See G. L. c. 156C, &#167; 9. Yet, no schedule of members that included Cambi was provided in connection with his motion to compel arbitration. Notably, although Cambi provided a detailed affidavit to the court in connection with an earlier filed attachment proceeding, nowhere in that affidavit, or any subsequent filing, does he state that he, personally, was listed as a Member of the LLC at any time.[5] Whether these anomalies in the record raise a dispute of fact is a nice question. Both the plaintiff and the defendants submit that they are entitled to relief as a matter of law.[6] I need not reach the question of Cambi's membership status, however, because even if he, like the LLC, is not a Member, and therefore not a signatory, both he and the LLC may enforce the arbitration provision as to Hanmer under an equitable estoppel theory. See Machado v. System4 LLC, 471 Mass. 204, 209-210 (2015). Equitable estoppel allows a non-signatory to compel arbitration in either of two circumstances: (1) when a signatory "must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory" or (2) when a signatory "raises allegations of substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by both the nonsignatory and one or more of the signatories to the contract." Machado, supra at 211 (quotations omitted). The first circumstance does not apply here. Hanmer's complaint does not rely on the terms of the contact, nor does he claim a breach of contract. Rather, the main thrust of his complaint concerns misrepresentation or fraud by Cambi, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, rescission, and breach of fiduciary duty. While these claims are "related" to the Operating Agreement, it does not appear that Hanmer must "rely" on the Agreement's actual provisions. His claims are not "closely related" to the terms of the Operating Agreement. However, the second form of equitable estoppel does apply here. "In assessing whether a [party] has advanced sufficient allegations of concerted misconduct, courts frequently look to the face of the complaint." Machado, supra at 412. Hanmer's complaint does allege, as it must do to make out a cause of action against all of the defendants, "substantially interdependent and concerned misconduct" by Cambi, the LLC, and SCC. See id. He repeatedly alleges that Cambi acted "both individually and in his capacity as an agent of Springfield Corp. and Springfield, LLC." As in Machado, the plaintiff "lumped the . . . defendants together." See id. at 215. All of the claims, save the one for breach of fiduciary duty and those against the reach and apply defendants, have been made against Cambi, SCC, and the LLC collectively on the theory that all three could be held liable for Cambi's misconduct. Hanmer's reliance on McCarthy v. Azure, 22 F.3d 351 (1st Cir. 1994), and Constantino v. Frechette, 73 Mass. App. Ct. 352 (2008), is unavailing, because these cases rely on other theories to bind a non-signatory, and those theories are not asserted here. The petition is denied. (Sullivan, J.). Notice/attest/Rup, J. Footnotes [1] Springfield Capital Corporation and Springfield Capital, LLC. (refers to case caption) [2] It is undisputed that SCC and Hanmer are a members of the LLC, though Hanmer seeks rescission of his agreement to join the LLC. [3] This matter falls under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. &#167; 1 et seq., as the investments were made in interstate commerce. See St. Fleur v. WPI Cable Systems/Mutron, 450 Mass. 345, 348 (2008). The FAA preempts the MAA to the extent that the two conflict, see Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Jr. Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 477 (1989), but Massachusetts law governs the procedures by which evidentiary disputes as to the existence of an agreement to arbitrate are decided. St. Fleur, supra. In any event, I see no conflict between the FAA and the MAA with respect to any question of law presented. [4] Hanmer claims that he cannot be compelled to arbitrate because the defendants have failed to demand arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. This argument fails to acknowledge the reality that Hanmer has sued the defendants, who are moving to enforce their right to seek arbitration by enforcing the agreement to arbitrate. More importantly, this argument raises at best a claim of procedural arbitrability, a claim which is for the arbitrator to decide. See Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79, 84 (2002), citing John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Livingston, 376 U. S. 543, 557 (1967); Mass. Highway Department v. Perini, Inc., 444 Mass. 366, 376-377 (1995); Carpenter v. Pomerantz, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 627, 628 (1994). [5] Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, par. 11.1.vi, all Members must be "Accredited Investors" as defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Hanmer executed an Investor's Questionnaire, but no questionnaire for Cambi appears in the record. I do not rely on the allegations of the verified complaint (par. 132) that appear to assert that Cambi was a member. The complaint was signed on information and belief, and there are no allegations showing a basis of knowledge. [6] If, on the other hand, the record raises a dispute of fact, then the matter must be remanded to the Superior Court for an expedited evidentiary hearing. See St. Fleur, supra.</td></tr>
